Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [58,59,81,84,61], mean=68.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for (L+1)=5 periods. No sustained changepoint or delayed arrivals observed yet. Use default promised lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base_stock that balances profit vs holding cost given standard historical variability.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent concluded history shows no arrivals yet (Period 1 order=90 arrived=0) \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time; treat promised lead time as authoritative. Historical demand samples (58,59,81,84,61) give mean\u224868.6/week; with promised L=4 the review+lead horizon =5 periods, so default (1+L)*mean \u2248343 demand over horizon. On-hand=0, in-transit=90 \u2014 pipeline (90) < target pipeline (~343), so OR should replenish to reach base-stock. Use default methods to let backend compute base_stock and caps from full-sample statistics.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=183 which matches orders placed in P1 (90) and P2 (93). Promised lead time is 4 periods and we have no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence to change lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean ~68.6; using default demand aggregation across (1+L) periods (where L=promised) keeps the OR engine's baseline forecast and variance estimates intact. This balances service vs holding cost conservatively while we wait for conclude messages to detect any lead-time or demand regime shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. On-hand=0, in-transit=309. History shows three consecutive conclude messages where orders placed (P1:90, P2:93, P3:126) arrived=0, so no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 cannot reliably infer a shorter/longer actual lead time; keep promised lead time. Use default demand estimates based on historical samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) scaled by (1+L) so the OR backend computes base_stock consistent with its statistical approach while the large in-transit quantity is left to be reconciled when/if arrivals conclude.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (90, 93, 126 units) have not concluded as arrived by Period 4 (arrived=0), indicating delayed or potentially lost shipments; monitor for confirmations in future concludes.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=416. Orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 have not yet concluded, but promised lead time is 4 periods so lack of arrivals in the Period 4 conclude is expected (no confirmed lead-time change). Historical weekly demand samples (58,59,81,84,61) give mean \u224868.6; use default methods to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with promised lead time. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) without overreacting to unconfirmed delivery delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5). On-hand=40, in-transit=326; several earlier orders remain in-transit (P2-P4). Demand samples (historical weeks Jan-Feb and recent periods) show elevated recent demand vs older baseline; to be responsive I use a recent_N forecast for demand and let the backend compute volatility from all samples. L set by observed lead times to match reality so pipeline coverage uses correct horizon.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order placed Period 1 arrived Period 5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=56, in-transit=309 (orders from P3,P4,P6 = 126+107+76). Historical demand samples (5 weekly points: mean=68.6) used. Observed concluded lead times: two arrivals show lead_time=4 \u2192 use calculated lead time. Use mu_hat default to scale (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples to capture baseline demand for review+lead period. Use sigma_hat default to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This choice acknowledges confirmed 4-period actual lead time, leverages full-sample demand stats, and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). On-hand=72 + in-transit=210 = 282 units in pipeline. Historical weekly mean demand \u224868.6 (samples: 58,59,81,84,61) \u2192 (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248343 for L=4, so pipeline is below the target coverage; choose conservative default forecasts so OR backend raises order to refill toward the base-stock. Use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates (whole-sample mean & std scaled by \u221a(1+L)) so the engine applies its capped ordering policy given confirmed L=4 and available demand history.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). On-hand=94, in-transit=226. Use observed lead time average to align pipeline; demand history (five weekly samples: 58,59,81,84,61) yields mean ~68.6. Set L to calculated avg observed lead time to reflect confirmed LT=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) so orders target (L+1)-period coverage while relying on full-sample stats; this balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) vs holding given confirmed stable lead time and no new regime shifts.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). On-hand=32, in-transit=313. Historical concludes show consistent observed lead times = 4 periods (orders from P1-P4 arrived after 4). Recent demand (Periods 1-9) is variable but shows no sustained regime shift requiring adjustment. Some earlier delays resolved (arrivals for P1-P4 confirmed as LT=4); no new evidence of lost shipments. Use calculate for L to lock in observed LT=4 from concluded history; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1) which implies moderate service target.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Current on-hand=28, in-transit=309 (pipeline ample). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals P5-P8 from orders P1-P4). Use lead-time estimate from observed history and default demand estimators since no sustained demand regime change is evident in available samples (5 weekly samples: mean=68.6). Choosing L="calculate" to reflect observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use "default" to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service (profit=holding cost) and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while pipeline is healthy.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=25, in-transit=319. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Several earlier orders were delayed but subsequently arrived with 4-period lag, so I use observed lead time. Recent demand has risen versus the winter samples (last 5 concluded demands: 62,156,105,95,90; recent mean \u2248101.6), so I bias the forecast to recent demand to protect service given long lead time. Therefore: L set from observed average lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use the most recent 5 demand samples (captures current higher demand and recent volatility). This increases target pipeline to reduce stockouts while the cap still limits order size to control holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals (orders in P1..P8 that concluded arrived after 4 periods), so use observed lead time. Recent demand (Periods 10-14 = 156,105,95,90,106) is higher than the older sample set\u2014use a recent-N forecast (N=5) for mu and sigma to capture the current higher-demand regime and reduce stockouts given L=4. These choices align base-stock to recent demand while the OR backend retains promised-L assumptions; no new lost-shipment evidence beyond documented delays.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=31, in-transit=419. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (orders that concluded list W=4). Several earlier delayed arrivals resolved but no sustained demand regime shift detected in the sample history. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time=4. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' (use all samples) because recent demand fluctuates but shows no sustained change of 3+ periods; using all-sample estimates gives a stable (1+L)-period forecast and volatility for the OR backend to balance service vs. holding given profit=holding. This also ensures pipeline + on-hand coverage across the (L+1) review+lead horizon while recognizing in-transit inventory may include delayed shipments.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand = 0, in-transit = 385 (no confirmed lost shipments currently). Demand history (weekly samples 58,59,81,84,61 plus subsequent periods) shows no sustained regime shift. I will use default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this leverages all available data and the confirmed LT=4 to balance service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

On-hand=3, in-transit=356 \u2192 ample pipeline stock. No clear recent demand regime shift in provided samples (weekly demands stable around historical mean). Choose L by calculate to confirm observed lead time=4 from history; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. With profit=holding, critical fractile q=0.5 (z*=0) so policy centers on mean demand\u2014this balances service vs holding given large pipeline and confirmed lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders: e.g., P1->arrived P5, P2->P6, etc.). On-hand=93, in-transit=292; pipeline plus on-hand provides cover but some recent orders briefly delayed then arrived consistent with L=4. I choose L via calculate to let backend confirm observed lead time average. Demand forecast uses default (all samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to produce a stable base-stock reflecting historical weekly demand; sigma_hat default to capture historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These conservative choices balance service level (profit=holding) while avoiding excess holding given shipments historically arrive on 4-period lead time.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Observed concluded history shows stable lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Current inventory: on-hand=121, in-transit=227 => pipeline+on-hand=348, which roughly equals forecasted (1+L)*mean demand. I choose L=default (promised 4) because concluded data confirms promised lead time. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses all historical demand samples (scaled by 1+L) for a conservative base-stock; this balances service (profit=holding so equal weight) by targeting long-run mean demand coverage while letting the capped order cap limit excessive ordering given holding cost and possible shipment loss history.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=10, in-transit=331. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period arrivals (multiple orders with lead_time=4); recent Period 20 conclude shows arrived=0 but that is expected until Period 24 for a 4-period lead. I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead-time={average observed = 4}. Demand stats supplied are limited; to avoid overfitting I use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This keeps base-stock sizing conservative given current large in-transit pipeline and equal profit/holding costs.

Recent demand (Periods 20-24) averaged 92.4 units/week, higher than early-sample mean; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To reflect the sustained higher recent demand I set L to promised (default=4) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes the base-stock to cover the 5-period review+lead window using the most recent regime (Periods 20-24). This ensures pipeline + orders target the elevated recent demand while keeping volatility measured from the same recent window.

Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent conclude history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time (multiple orders observed arriving after 4 periods). On-hand=87, in-transit=321 (ample pipeline). Use lead time inferred from observed history to match reality and let backend compute base_stock from full-sample demand stats (no strong recent regime shift detected from available samples). Default mu_hat/sigma_hat let OR engine produce (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding so q=0.5.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12): recent weekly demand ~54\u201394 (last 5 demands mean \u224878). On-hand=91 + in-transit=278 provides healthy pipeline vs promised L=4. Several past late arrivals confirmed lead time=4; no new prolonged losses. Choose L=default (use promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the most recent regime (stable summer demand ~78/week) so the OR backend balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

On-hand=108, in-transit=184 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers several weeks of demand. No sustained demand regime shift detected; recent demand is variable but centered near historical mean. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over samples; this balances service level (profit=holding so q=0.5) without overreacting to short delays or single-period demand fluctuations.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Pipeline plus on-hand is ample vs typical weekly demand samples. I use calculate for L to let backend confirm observed lead time from concluded history. For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) because no sustained demand regime shift or seasonal spike is evident in the provided small sample set; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=68, in-transit=329 \u2014 pipeline is healthy vs. typical weekly demand (historical samples). Several earlier late/no-arrival events resolved into 4-period arrivals, so I will trust promised lead time. Use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base-stock while capping orders; this balances service (profit=holding cost) without introducing extra inventory from an explicit forecast tweak.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time in many prior periods; several isolated zero-arrival events occurred but not a sustained loss pattern. Pipeline (370) plus on-hand comfortably covers multiple (1+L) periods of typical demand, so use inferred lead time from observations and default demand/volatility estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding overfitting to recent noise.

Current on-hand=142 and in-transit=262 provide substantial pipeline cover; no overdue shipments currently missing across multiple concludes. I select L=default to use the promised/standard 4-period lead time (confirmed historically), mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, and sigma_hat=default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This conservative choice relies on full-sample statistics to balance service (profit=holding cost) without overreacting to short-term noise.

Historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time and no new sustained demand regime change; available demand samples are limited to the baseline series. Promised lead time (4) remains appropriate. To avoid overfitting to recent noise and because profit=holding (symmetric costs), use default methods so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, letting the backend determine the base stock and capped order quantity.

Inventory is healthy (on-hand covers near-term demand) so use conservative defaults tied to promised lead time. Choose default L to use promised 4; default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level vs holding cost given Profit=Holding cost ($1 vs $1) which implies q=0.5 and moderate safety stock.

Current on-hand=282 and in-transit=98 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=380, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 weeks at recent demand; no new lost-shipment signals and past concluded data confirms actual lead time=4. Use promised lead time (default). Use recent demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower recent regime (capture last 8 concluded demand observations to smooth short-term variability). This reduces order aggressiveness versus using all-sample mean and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

=== Period 37 Summary ===
554772002: ordered=0, arrived=18 units (ordered on Period 33, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=300, demand=17, sold=17, ending on-hand inventory=283

Daily Reward (R_t): $-266.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand history shows stable weekly sales (historical samples around 58\u201384) and many concluded arrivals imply actual lead time = 4 consistently. On-hand=283, in-transit=80 gives healthy coverage; no recent sustained demand shift detected. Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) versus holding cost conservatively given ample inventory and no new changepoint.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Historical concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead time of 4 periods (many P->P+4 confirms). On-hand=298, in-transit=64 -> pipeline is ample vs recent low demand. Recent demand (Periods 30-38) settled at a lower regime (~30->20s/week). To avoid overstock while preserving service, set L via observed average lead times and base demand forecasts on the recent low-demand regime (last 9 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine reduces target base-stock to current demand levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=313, in-transit=42. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; use promised/default L to match supplier behavior and OR engine assumptions. Recent demand has shifted sharply lower since Period 31 (sustained ~9 periods), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to reflect the new lower-demand regime (reduces over-ordering vs. default long-run mean). This keeps base-stock tied to current demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility for safety stock. The large on-hand position already provides coverage; these parameters reduce future orders to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for observed lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31 (2019/9/9): avg demand dropped to 25.33 over Periods 31\u201339 (9 periods) from ~90 prior (~72% decrease); treat as sustained lower-demand regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 31: avg demand \u224825.33 over Periods 31\u201339. On-hand 317 + in-transit 25 is large relative to current demand; shipments historically have actual lead time = 4. To avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), set lead time by observed data and forecast demand from the recent low-demand regime. L: use calculate (average observed lead times = 4). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 31\u201339). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend toward a base stock near the recent mean (minimizing extra safety stock since z*=0) and limit new receipts given high on-hand inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 31 (avg ~25/week since then). Current inventory is high (on-hand 297, in-transit 25) and promised lead time is 4. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service in the low-demand regime, use the promised lead time (default) and estimate demand/volatility from the recent low-demand regime (last 11 periods, Periods 31\u201341) so the OR backend will set a much lower base stock reflective of the new regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=289, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show 4-period arrivals (confirming lead time=4). Demand dropped starting Period 31 (2019-09-09) to a sustained low regime (avg \u224825.33 over P31\u2013P39). To reflect the new low-demand regime, set lead time by averaging observed lead times and set demand forecast and volatility using the recent regime samples (N=9 periods) so the OR engine sizes orders for the lower mean and observed short-term variability while avoiding excess overstock given current high on-hand.

To align supply with the new low-demand regime, set lead time to calculated (uses observed leads=4). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent data from the low-demand regime (last 9 post-change samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; set sigma_hat from the same recent window to capture current volatility. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent confirmed regime: demand dropped around Period 31 to ~25/wk and has persisted; current on-hand 271, in-transit 0 so inventory is ample vs low demand. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. Use promised lead time (default). For demand, use recent_N over the low-demand regime (Periods 31\u201344, regime_length=14) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of last 14 samples and volatility from last 14 samples; this keeps orders small to avoid holding cost while meeting low demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=257, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 4; demand has been in the lower regime since Period 31 (sustained lower mean). I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=15 (Periods 31\u201345) to capture the sustained low-demand regime: (1+L)\xd7mean over the recent regime provides a conservative base-stock reflecting current demand. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=15 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices reduce over-ordering relative to older high-demand data while preserving service given confirmed lead time and current on-hand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=243, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (many orders: ordered on Pn arrived on Pn+4). Demand regime shifted down starting Period 31 (avg \u224825.33 over P31\u2013P39 and remained low through P46). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm the 4-period reality, set mu_hat using recent data from the low-demand regime (recent_N) to avoid inflating orders from historical high-demand periods, and set sigma_hat from the same recent window to capture current volatility. I choose N=16 (Periods 31\u201346 inclusive = 16 periods) where the low-demand regime is sustained; N satisfies the rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3). These parameters reduce overstock risk given high holding cost (equal to profit) while preserving service for the current lower demand environment.
