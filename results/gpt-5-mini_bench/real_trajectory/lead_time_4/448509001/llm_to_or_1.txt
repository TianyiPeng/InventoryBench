Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [65,117,162,118,146] (mean \u2248 121.6). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time; use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. Use default L (promised=4), default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean demand \u2248121.6 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=183 (ordered in Period 1 but arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=367, two recent orders (P1=183, P2=184) have not concluded but promised lead time is 4 periods so arrivals are not yet expected. Historical demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show no clear sustained regime shift. I retain the promised lead time and use default demand estimates so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost while awaiting arrival confirmations.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=552 (matches ordered 183+184+185). No concluded arrivals in Periods 1-3, so actual lead time is unobserved; use promised lead time. Demand history (5 samples) mean ~121.6/wk; with promised L=4 use default aggregation to let backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service level (covering 5-week demand) vs holding cost given profit=$4, holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Periods 1-3 (183,184,185 = 552 units) remain unconcluded after 3 periods; suggests actual lead time > promised or potential lost shipments\u2014treat as overdue until confirmed.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=698 (orders from P1\u2013P4) but zero arrivals concluded so far\u2014shipments overdue; however no concluded arrivals exist so cannot confirm actual lead time yet. I use L=default (promised 4) because lead-time confirmation requires concluded arrivals. Demand history (five samples: 65,117,162,118,146) is limited and shows no sustained regime shift, so use default aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR backend compute base stock while avoiding speculative explicit forecasts. This balances service level (captures lead-time + review period demand) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded arrivals show an order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=4 (Period1->Period5), so actual lead time confirmed at 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=543 (includes multiple outstanding orders; some earlier orders were delayed but at least one arrival confirms L=4). Recent demand (Periods 1-5 concluded sales: 149,150,115,173,225) is materially higher than the older historical samples (65,117,162,118,146). I set L by calculation to capture observed lead-time evidence. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent regime across the last 5 concluded periods; sigma also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock higher to avoid stockouts given confirmed L=4 and higher recent demand while sigma_recent increases safety stock to balance holding cost vs. lost sales risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5: arrived=183, ordered on Period1, lead_time=4); Demand regime shift: recent 5-period mean demand = 162.4 vs. earlier sample mean = 121.6 (+33.5%), sustained over 5 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=18, in-transit=589. Recent concl shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 (Period1->P5, Period2->P6). Demand has shifted higher and is sustained: recent 5-period mean = 162.4 vs historical mean 121.6 (+33.5%). Pipeline contains large outstanding receipts (some earlier overdue resolved); no new missing-shipment signal. Set L to default (promised=4) because observed lead times match promise. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet higher demand while balancing holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has been elevated (5-period mean \u2248162.4 vs earlier mean 121.6, +33.5%). On-hand=64, in-transit=636; prior late arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (observed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). I set L to be inferred from observations (stable at 4). For demand forecast I use the most recent 5 periods to capture the sustained higher regime (recent_N N=5). Volatility likewise uses the last 5 samples to reflect current variability. These choices ensure the OR backend builds a base-stock that covers (1+L) periods of the newly higher demand while reflecting current variance and avoiding excess holding given holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=686. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1-P4 arrived with W=4). Recent 5-period mean demand = 162.4 (sustained +33.5% vs earlier). Set L by observed history (calculate average lead time) and set demand forecast using recent 5 periods to capture the higher regime; match sigma to recent volatility over same window. This balances higher service needs from increased demand against holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 4 periods (observed for orders placed P1\u2192P5); recent demand has shifted up (recent 5-period mean \u2248162.4 vs earlier mean \u2248121.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=932 covers multiple future periods but we must target higher recent demand. Set L by calculation to reflect observed lead time=4. Set mu_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $345.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand elevated vs. historical baseline (last 5 observed demands Periods 6-10 mean ~168 vs historic sample mean 121.6). On-hand=115, in-transit=816 (large pipeline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use calculated L to reflect observed reality. To capture the elevated recent demand regime and reduce stockouts, set mu_hat using recent 5-period average ((1+L)\xd7recent mean) and set sigma_hat from recent 5-period volatility to reflect current variability. This balances higher service-level needs (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=238, in-transit=597. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P1->P5 etc.) and demand has shifted up (recent 5-period mean \u2248162.4 vs earlier mean 121.6, sustained). To respect observed lead time I let the optimizer compute L from observed lead-times (calculate). To capture the sustained higher demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, improving service during the higher-demand regime while letting the capped ordering reduce extreme over-ordering relative to naive long-run stats. This balances higher service needs against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=350, in-transit=465. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand increase (recent 5-period mean = 162.4 vs earlier mean 121.6). No new lost shipments observed. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine raises the base stock accordingly while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost.

Inventory is currently ample vs recent demand, so use observed lead time (calculate) and default demand/volatility estimators to let the OR engine compute base-stock while reflecting all historical samples. This balances a high service target (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.8) with current large on-hand to avoid unnecessary additional ordering.

Recent demand regime elevated: last 5 concluded demands mean = 162.4 vs earlier sample mean = 121.6 (+33.5%), sustained over 5 periods. To capture the new higher demand I set L by calculating observed lead times and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (recent_N=5) so the OR backend targets a (1+L)-period forecast based on the elevated regime; this raises base stock to avoid stockouts while the capped order limit and holding cost still constrain excessive ordering.

Demand historical samples mean=121.6 (provided). To keep policy aligned with confirmed lead time and long-run demand signal, set L to calculated (backend will infer average observed lead time = 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding ratio) against holding costs given large on-hand position and stable confirmed lead time.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=500, in-transit=173. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history (Period1\u2192Period5 arrival). Recent demand has dropped sharply: Periods 16-20 demands = [47,40,30,33,22], mean=34.4 over 5 periods vs prior recent mean ~162.4 noted earlier. Choose L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time=4. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 and sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new low-demand regime (most recent 5 periods) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and variability estimates, lowering future orders and holding costs while preserving service for current lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: recent 5-period mean demand decreased to 34.4 (Periods 16-20: 47,40,30,33,22) from prior recent mean ~162.4 (\u221278.8%), sustained over 5 periods.

On-hand=579, in-transit=55 \u2014 inventory is high vs. current demand, so reduce forecast horizon exposure. Set lead time method to calculate (observed lead time consistently 4). For demand mean and volatility use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime (reduces ordering and holding). This keeps OR backend base-stock low and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service for the current lower-demand regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has dropped from earlier highs; last 5 periods demands = [30,33,22,39,97], mean \u224844.2 (the 97 is a one-week spike). On-hand=482, in-transit=55 \u2192 total available 537 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of forecast demand if L=4. Lead time has been empirically confirmed as 4 in history; I therefore use the promised/default L to keep OR engine assumptions consistent. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime while allowing the single spike to be smoothed by the 5-sample window. Sigma is also recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding excess ordering given large on-hand stock while maintaining a high service level (q=0.8) implied by Profit/Holding.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22): on-hand=391, in-transit=55 -> pipeline=446 units. Historical lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods repeatedly; recent demand shows volatility but last 5 periods (P19-P23) average demand = 55.8 units/week. Promised L=4 is still valid. To reflect the most recent regime and avoid overstock while covering the 5-period review+lead window, I set L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 (captures recent mean across P19-P23), and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 (captures recent volatility). With (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*55.8=279 units expected demand over the lead+review horizon, current pipeline (446) is ample, so the OR engine will likely order zero; these params balance service vs holding cost given recent demand drop and recent spikes.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=381, in-transit=0; no overdue unconcluded shipments currently (recent concluded lead times = 4). Recent demand has risen vs the low regime around Periods 16-20; last 5 period demands (P20-P24) = [22,39,97,91,65], showing higher mean and volatility. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N N=5 to capture the recent demand regime and current volatility so orders reflect recent higher mean and variability, avoiding excessive stock build from older low-demand periods while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=302, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4. Recent demand (Periods 21-25 = 39,97,91,65,79) shows a new moderate regime vs earlier highs; use a recent-5 demand estimate to capture current level and volatility. Set L to default (promised=4) since concluded history confirms 4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, balancing service (capturing recent rebound) vs holding cost given large on-hand stock.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has moderated vs. earlier spike; last 5 realized weekly demands (Periods 22-26) = [97,91,65,79,120], mean=90.4. On-hand=182 plus in-transit=113 gives pipeline=295\u2014ample cover vs. near-term demand, but we must still target appropriate base-stock for the now-lower demand regime. Observed concluded lead times consistently =4 periods; use calculate to let backend confirm average (will be 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime ((1+L)-scaled mean and volatility over the most recent 5 periods). This reduces over-ordering from earlier high-demand regime while maintaining service level given profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1). No evidence of new lost shipments.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19): on-hand=0, in-transit=238. Recent demand has risen and exhausted inventory (Periods 23-27 demands = 91,65,79,120,182; recent-5 mean=107.4) so I bias the forecast toward recent demand. Lead time history shows consistent 4-period arrivals in concluded messages; use calculated average lead time to reflect observed behavior. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the latest demand regime and volatility (short window because demand shifted recently and current stockouts indicate elevated demand). This yields higher target base-stock to reduce lost sales while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variability so the OR backend can size safety stock; using observed L (calculate) prevents under-ordering if actual lead time differs from the promised default.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 when observed. I set L to 'calculate' so backend computes the observed average lead time (matches confirmed 4). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 weeks (captures current regime and volatility), which helps the OR backend size orders to meet near-term demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4.

To capture current demand regime and observed lead time, set L by 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times).

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=670. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded messages show ordered -> arrived with lead_time=4). Recent demand (Periods 26-31: 120,182,158,114,165,135) shows a sustained higher regime vs. early-sample mean; I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current elevated demand pattern. L chosen via calculate to reflect observed lead times. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=6) to base the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the most recent consistent regime. This keeps the base-stock responsive to current demand while the OR cap prevents excessive single-period ordering; given in-transit=670, this should be sufficient to cover pipeline for several periods but the recent-N forecast avoids underordering if demand stays elevated.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent weekly demands (Periods 28-32 = 158,114,165,135,134) show a higher, stable demand regime versus the original sample mean (121.6). On-hand=50 + in-transit=595 provides a large pipeline but arrivals are observed with 4-period actual lead time historically. I set L by computing observed lead times (consistent 4) so the OR engine uses the empirical average. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (captures the current post-regime demand level and variance) so base-stock targets reflect current demand while avoiding overstating variability from older low-demand periods. This balances service (reduce stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost because substantial pipeline already exists.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=659. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods repeatedly (arrivals consistently show W=4). Recent demand has rebounded: last 5 observed demands (Periods 30-34) = [165,135,134,275,134], 5-period mean = 168.6, noticeably higher than earlier low-regime values around Periods16-20. I therefore keep lead time at the promised/default (4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current high-demand regime so the OR engine raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of this higher demand while using recent volatility for safety.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=69, in-transit=749. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders observed with W=4). Recent demand (Periods 31-35 = 135,134,275,134,110) shows a sustained uptick versus the prior low regime. I set L to default (use promised 4) because concluded history confirms promised lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current elevated demand regime over the last 5 periods and to let the OR engine size base stock for (1+L) review+lead coverage. I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility (including the 275 spike). These choices balance service (reduce stockouts given rebound) against holding cost by using a short recent window rather than all-time averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: recent 5-period mean demand = 157.6 (Periods 31-35: 135,134,275,134,110) vs prior low mean 34.4 (Period21), +359%, sustained over 5 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand recovered to the higher regime (Periods 32-36 demands = 134,275,134,110,79; recent 5-mean ~146.4) after the low-period regime; actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals). On-hand=99 + in-transit=736 provides large pipeline but some arrivals are recent; to match observed LT=4 and capture the recent high-mean regime I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This balances service level (capture elevated demand) while keeping holding risk visible to the OR engine given the large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=106, in-transit=675. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods (confirmed historically). Recent 5-period demand (Periods 33-37) = 275,134,110,79,93 => mean=138.2, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime vs earlier low. To align ordering with the current regime while limiting holding cost, set L to default (promised 4), and forecast demand with recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current short-term mean and variance rather than older data.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand (last 5 periods: P34-P38 demands = 134,110,79,93,133) shows a current average ~109.8/unit \u2014 lower than the previously recorded spike but materially different from long-run historical mean. On-hand (244) + in-transit (464) = 708 units, which covers several future weeks given current demand; no outstanding unconcluded shipments beyond the confirmed lead-time pattern. Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use the promised/default lead time. To reflect the most recent demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures current mean/volatility over the last 5 observed demand periods) so the OR backend will size base-stock to the current demand level while keeping safety stock consistent with recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts if demand re-accelerates) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand regime reverted to higher levels around Periods 31-36; latest concluded demands (P36-39 = 79,93,133,64) still elevated vs earlier low regime. On-hand=449 + in-transit=195 gives 644 units in pipeline \u2014 ample coverage vs short-term demand, but high service ratio (profit=4, holding=1 \u2192 q=0.8) favors maintaining higher base stock. Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures most recent 5 demand observations) so the OR backend computes (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility from the most relevant window.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=490, in-transit=99. Recent demand (Periods 36-40) = [79,93,133,64,55], recent 5-mean = 84.8 units/week. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; no new evidence of lost shipments. Pipeline + on-hand (589) comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods of recent demand (\u2248424). To align the OR base-stock with the current lower-demand regime and to avoid excess holding cost, I use promised lead time (default) and recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes demand over the review+lead horizon and volatility from the most recent stable regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=481, in-transit=60. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no current evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 37-41: 93,133,64,55,48) averages 78.6, materially below the prior high regime (~157.6). To adapt the base-stock forecast to the recent lower demand while keeping the confirmed lead time, set L to promised (default), forecast demand using recent 5 periods to capture the new regime, and estimate volatility from the same recent window. These parameters reduce excess ordering and holding cost while maintaining service given current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: recent 5-period mean demand = 78.6 (Periods 37-41: 93,133,64,55,48) vs prior mean 157.6 (Period36), \u221250.0%, sustained over 5 periods.

Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=267, in-transit=0; no new arrivals expected this period. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods \u2014 use promised/default lead time behavior. Recent demand shows a one-period spike in Period 42 (274) but not a sustained regime shift (requires 3+ periods). To keep responsiveness to recent demand while damping single-period noise, I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and std (covers last 5 realized demands). This yields mu_hat and sigma_hat focused on the most recent demand regime and balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed L=4.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand shows a mixed pattern with a large spike in Period 42 (274) but the last 5 demands (P39-43 = 64,55,48,274,108) give a recent 5-period mean ~109.8. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Current on-hand (159) + in-transit (272) = 431 units, which covers multiple periods at the recent demand pace but we avoid inflating safety stock after the single large spike. Decisions: keep L = promised (4) consistent with observed concludes; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current regime while limiting influence of older regimes.

Observed lead times have consistently been 4 in concluded history, and in-transit = 538 units. I set L=default (promised 4) since concluded arrivals confirm LT=4; mu_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime; sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Choose default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (q from profit/holding) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.
