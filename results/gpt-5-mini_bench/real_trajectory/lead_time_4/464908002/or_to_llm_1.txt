Adjustment decision: recent observations show a clear downward pattern (most recent weeks 64,50,36) and the last two weeks are especially low; holding cost is low but ordering the full OR quantity (87) would build large stock relative to recent demand and risk excess holding across the long lead time if the decline persists. With no evidence that lead time is shorter than promised or shipments inbound, I keep a conservative buffer to cover several periods but reduce the OR recommendation. I set the order to 60 units \u2014 roughly one single-period mean (~58) plus a modest safety margin to cover near-term demand under the promised L=4.

  "rationale": "History shows lead time = 4 (confirmed). Recent demand (Periods 39\u201346) averages ~26.6 units/week, matching the carry-over insight that demand dropped to ~25.4 \u2014 demand remains low and no new sustained shift is observed. Current coverage: on-hand 42 + in-transit 80 = 122 units, which covers roughly 4.6 periods at ~26.6/week; target coverage is (L+1)=5 periods \u2248 133 (5\xd726.6) but given noise it's acceptable to hold a small buffer. OR's recommendation (102) assumes higher demand and uses the promised lead time; it would overstock given the confirmed lower-demand regime. Ordering a small top-up (5 units) preserves service over the next lead time while avoiding excess holding cost. Therefore place a conservative order of 5 units to keep pipeline + on-hand near the 5-period coverage without materially increasing holding costs.",
