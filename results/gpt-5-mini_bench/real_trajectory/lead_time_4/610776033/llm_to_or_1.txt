Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a sharp upward shift (samples: 0,0,24,58,84). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no cover for upcoming periods. Use promised lead time (default L=4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (samples 24,58,84) so (1+L)-period demand reflects the recent spike. Use recent_N N=3 for sigma to reflect volatility of the same recent regime. These parameters raise target base-stock to improve service during the confirmed demand increase while the capped order prevents extreme over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: avg of last 3 periods (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) = 55.33 vs earlier two weeks (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14) = 0

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand regime shift detected starting 2019-01-21: last 3 samples avg = 55.33/wk vs earlier 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=105. Promised lead time used (default) because no concluded arrivals exist to contradict it; the in-transit 105 does not cover (1+L) periods under the new higher mean, so raise mu_hat based on recent demand to reflect the regime change. Use recent_N for mu_hat (last 3 samples) to capture the higher mean; keep sigma_hat as default (use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances service (capture the new higher demand) vs holding cost conservatively given limited transit evidence of lead-time change.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent history: two outstanding orders (P1=105, P2=175) remain in-transit (280 total) with no concluded arrivals yet; cannot yet confirm lead-time change. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (last 3 samples: 24,58,84; earlier weeks were 0). To capture the higher recent demand while not prematurely changing lead-time, use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates from the recent regime using the last 3 samples (N=3). This raises mu_hat to reflect the new higher mean over the review+lead period and uses recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This balances service (covering elevated demand) against holding cost while keeping L conservative until arrivals conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand is much higher than the earlier samples: Period1=129, Period2=268, Period3=233 (regime shift to higher demand confirmed). On-hand=0, in-transit=599 but none of the recent orders have concluded as arrived yet (arrived=0 for Periods 1-3), so shipments may be delayed or lost\u2014we cannot confirm an actual lead-time change from concluded messages. To protect service given the clear upward demand regime, set L to default (use promised lead time = 4) but base demand forecast on the most recent 3 periods to capture the new higher mean/volatility. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat increases replenishment targets to meet elevated demand while the pipeline situation is monitored. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the new high-demand regime) against holding cost since profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=928 (sum of orders P1\u2013P4). No concluded arrivals for any past orders through Period 4, indicating prolonged delays or lost shipments. To protect service given the recent demand regime shift (avg of last 3 samples = 55.33/wk), I increase the assumed lead time to be conservative so base-stock covers more future demand, and use a recent_N forecast (last 3 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime starting 2019-01-21. This balances higher service level (catch up for missing arrivals) against holding cost by relying on short-window demand stats rather than the entire low-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (total 928 units) had arrived=0 by Period 4 conclude; likely shipments delayed or lost\u2014monitor for confirmed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has been consistently high (demands in Periods 1-5 = 129,268,233,174,160). On-hand=0, in-transit=1127 (outstanding orders from Periods 2-5 plus remaining pipeline). Period 5 conclude showed arrival of 105 units (ordered P1) confirming at least one on-time arrival with observed lead_time=4. Choose L by calculating observed lead times to confirm the realized lead time; use recent demand (last 5 periods) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend stocks for service while capping orders via its cap rule. This balances high profit vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in Period 5 conclude: ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $175.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent demand remains elevated compared to early-Jan baseline. Evidence: concluded demands P1\u2013P6 = [129,268,233,174,160,207] showing sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21. On-hand=0, in-transit=952 (some earlier delayed arrivals have since concluded), which provides pipeline cover but uncertainty remains. I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (both concluded arrivals indicate 4), and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated mean and volatility from the last 6 observed demand periods so the OR backend targets service for the new regime while limiting excess holding (profit and holding cost equal encourages moderate safety stock).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime: last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 3\u20137) = 233,174,160,207,221 (mean \u2248199). On-hand=98 + in-transit=657 =755 units, which is below (1+L)*recent mean if L\u22484 (5*199\u2248995) so we must forecast using recent high-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals at W=4); use calculated L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 5 samples to capture current mean/volatility and avoid being pulled by older near-zero weeks.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent weekly demand has stabilized at a higher regime (recent demands: P6=207, P7=221, P8=245). On-hand=182, in-transit=568 \u2014 pipeline large relative to current demand, and past conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4. I set L to be inferred from observations (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent stable demand level (P6\u2013P8) and reduce influence of the earlier low-demand weeks. Sigma uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock focused on current demand regime while the large in-transit inventory prevents aggressive ordering and limits holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). On-hand=299 + in-transit=520 = 819 units, which comfortably covers several periods of elevated demand (recent regime mean higher since 2019-01-21). I set L to be inferred from observed data (average observed lead times = 4) using method "calculate". For demand, use default aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures the historical + recent regime in the provided sample set). Use default volatility so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. These choices align the backend's base-stock calculation with confirmed lead time and the available demand history while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent history shows sustained higher weekly demand since 2019-01-21 and confirmed actual lead time = 4 (observed arrivals from P1-P4 with W=4). Current on-hand 47 + in-transit 520 covers several weeks but demand remains ~200/wk recently. I set L via calculate to use observed lead times (all recent observed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 5\u201310 demands = 160,207,221,245,187,252; mean\u2248212) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean to match current regime. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices align the OR backend to the confirmed 4-period lead time and the higher recent demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent weekly demand has settled at a much higher regime (Periods 7-11 demands = 221,245,187,252,253 => recent mean ~231.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=766 (multiple prior delayed arrivals now resolved; lead time has been observed as 4). I set L = default (promised 4, consistent with observed arrivals). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime using the five most recent concluded demands; this raises the base-stock to cover (L+1) periods of the new demand while sigma from recent volatility controls safety stock so we avoid excessive holding given $1 holding cost equal to $1 profit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand is in a higher regime: last 6 weekly demands = {221,245,187,252,253,246}, avg\u2248234/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=804. With promised L=4, review+lead horizon=(1+L)=5 weeks; recent demand\xd75\u22481,170 units\u2014pipeline (804) is insufficient, so parameters should target the new higher-demand regime. I set L to default (use promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained post-2019-01-21 regime (stable elevated mean and variance). This raises the base-stock to cover the higher 5-week demand while sigma based on the same recent window balances service level vs. holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=109, in-transit=825. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (orders observed with W=4), so set L to calculated average. Demand shows a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21; use recent_N=3 (samples 24,58,84) to capture the higher recent mean for the (1+L)-period demand forecast and matching recent volatility for safety stock. These settings keep base-stock responsive to the confirmed higher demand while capping over-ordering given high holding cost (profit=holding cost).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has settled into a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (recent weekly demands mostly 147\u2013253). On-hand=0, in-transit=968 (sufficient to cover multiple periods). Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P9 concluded with lead_time=4). I set L to 'calculate' so backend confirms observed lead time average (should be ~4). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current higher-demand regime (gives (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices let the OR engine size base-stock to current demand while using observed lead time; using recent data avoids diluting forecasts with early zero-demand weeks and responds to the sustained demand increase and prior shipment delays.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). On-hand=132, in-transit=730 (pipeline substantial). Recent demand (Periods 10\u201315): [252,253,246,147,114,138] indicating a lower but variable regime versus earlier launch peaks; to reflect the current regime and avoid overstock while maintaining service with high pipeline, use a recent-window forecast. Chosen methods: L by calculation to lock to observed average lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N (N=6) to base the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the most recent consistent regime and reduce sensitivity to early high-launch spikes. This balances profit vs holding cost by sizing base-stock to recent demand while the OR engine's cap limits oversized orders given the large existing pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has settled to mid-hundreds per week; on-hand=285, in-transit=549 (sizable pipeline). Actual arrivals historically show consistent 4-period lead times. To keep the OR engine responsive to the most recent demand regime while avoiding overweighting older zero-demand weeks, I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (captures Periods 12\u201316 demand: 246,147,114,138,125). Using recent statistics balances service (profit=holding) with inventory risk given substantial pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (observed arrivals from orders placed P1\u2013P13 all with 4-period lag). On-hand 343 + in-transit 272 = 615 units, which covers multiple weeks given recent weekly demand ~200. I choose to let backend use observed lead time average and default demand estimates so the OR engine's base-stock calculation uses full-sample mean/variance (no strong new demand regime or variance shift since earlier confirmed regime change). This balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) against holding cost while preserving pipeline smoothing against occasional delayed arrivals.

Demand has remained at a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained weekly demands ~150\u2013300). To capture current higher demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on most recent regime). Keep L at default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded lead-time evidence matches the promise and the OR backend expects promised L.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=553. Historical concludes consistently show lead_time=4 (many P->P+4 arrivals), so use calculated lead time. Demand has remained in the higher regime since 2019-01-21; recent demand (last 6 periods: P14-P19) averages ~204.8/week, so I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the upshift and protect service. Use recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given confirmed 4-period lead time and elevated recent demand, while keeping volatility based on the same recent window.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent weeks show sustained high weekly demand (many weeks 150\u2013370) and current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=826. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. To target service while limiting holding cost given profit=holding cost, I use a lead-time estimate derived from observed lead times and focus demand estimates on the most recent data (last 20 samples) to capture the elevated regime. This keeps base-stock responsive to recent higher demand while sigma based on recent variability to size safety stock conservatively.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=1065. Recent demand has settled at a much higher regime (~250\u2013320/week) vs early zeroes; many periods show demands ~250\u2013320 (Periods 17\u201321: 219,262,371,306,320). Historical arrivals confirm lead time = 4 consistently. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time. To capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility, I use recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (balances recency with sample size; N=8 covers the most recent weeks that reflect the current regime). These parameters steer the OR backend toward a base-stock sized for the recent elevated demand while respecting the observed 4-period lead time and large in-transit pipeline.

On-hand=0, in-transit=983. I choose L=calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (~200-300 units/week) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*mean of last 20 samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to capture current volatility. These settings bias the base-stock to cover the review+lead window under the sustained higher demand while keeping variance estimates tied to recent data to avoid overstock from older low-demand samples.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime since 2019-01-21 (avg of early spike vs prior zeros). Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded messages. Current on-hand 7 + in-transit 824 = 831 covers multiple upcoming periods but demand remains high, so use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the elevated regime while using observed lead time. Chosen L: calculate (uses observed lead times, which are consistently 4). Chosen mu_hat: recent_N with N=10 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last ~10 demand samples capturing the sustained higher demand. Chosen sigma_hat: recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep the base stock tuned to the higher recent demand while the calculate L ensures the OR backend accounts for the confirmed 4-period lead time and avoids underordering given delayed arrivals historically.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has been high and relatively stable (last 5 period demands ~306,320,231,272,229; mean ~271). On-hand = 148, in-transit = 802 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to one-period demand but lead time arrivals remain consistent at 4 periods historically. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm 4-period lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and limit stockouts I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability based on the latest demand pattern; this favors service while the large in-transit reduces urgent ordering. These parameters balance service level vs holding cost by aligning base stock to current demand rates while relying on existing pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has settled into a higher regime (recent weeks average \u2248265 units/week). Observed lead time consistently 4 periods; on-hand (212) + in-transit (904)=1116 which is below (1+L)*recent_mean (~5*265=1325), so parameters use recent demand to raise target stock. Set L by calculating observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (last 9 periods: P17\u2013P25). These settings increase base_stock to meet service level while sigma estimated from same window to reflect recent volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=136, in-transit=1018 (ample pipeline). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand in recent 5 periods (P22\u2013P26) averages ~215 units/week; I use a recent_N forecast to capture current elevated regime while keeping sigma default to let OR use full-sample volatility. Chosen L=default (promised 4) since confirms match observed arrivals; mu_hat uses recent_N N=5 to target the current demand level over the (1+L) horizon; sigma_hat=default to avoid underestimating variability given earlier regime shifts and occasional missing arrivals.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent history shows consistent observed lead times = 4 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Demand permanently shifted up starting 2019-01-21 (early periods show 0 then sustained higher demand). To keep the OR backend aligned with current high-demand regime, set L using calculated average of observed lead times. For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N to focus the estimate on the most recent regime; choose N=20 to capture the last ~20 periods of demand (large enough to be stable but recent enough to reflect post-changepoint behavior). This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts) against holding cost by using recent demand and measured volatility rather than long-ago zeros.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=252, in-transit=660. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Demand since mid-July (Periods 21\u201328) is stable at a higher level (demands: 320,231,272,229,175,171,158,194; recent mean \u2248255). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding \u2192 critical tradeoff), use promised/confirmed lead time and set demand estimates using recent data (last 8 periods) to capture the higher regime while keeping volatility estimated from the same window.

I keep L as promised (default) consistent with observed confirmations. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the last ~20 periods' higher demand regime and avoid dilution by the two early zero weeks. Sigma_hat left as default to let backend compute volatility from full sample scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize service (profit=holding so equal) while using recent demand to size base stock and the backend cap to limit aggressive ordering given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand is stable at a much higher regime than the tiny Jan samples; rolling sales since Period 21 average ~200/week with occasional dips (most recent demands: 117,178,194,158,171,175,229,272). On-hand=507 + in-transit=467 gives ample cover vs one lead cycle, and past concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. I set L=default (use promised 4). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts using the most recent behavior (captures current mean and volatility). Chose N=8 to cover ~2 months of recent weeks (N between 3 and 20) balancing responsiveness and noise. This reduces stockouts while avoiding excessive holding given profit=holding cost parity.

I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (avg of concluded lead times \u22484).

For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to focus the forecast on the most recent low-demand regime (captures last two months) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets a base stock aligned with current demand and avoids unnecessary holding cost while maintaining service.

Recent demand has settled to a lower regime (recent demands: 117,109,83,117,68,49) with current on-hand=548 and in-transit=308 (total pipeline=856) which is ample vs (1+L) periods of demand. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. I use L=default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current low-demand regime (last 6 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a lower base-stock and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has fallen from summer peaks to a lower regime: Periods 31\u201336 demands = [109,83,117,68,49,31] (avg \u2248 76). On-hand=517, in-transit=308 -> ample pipeline coverage vs near-term demand; no overdue shipments outstanding. Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. I set L=default (use promised 4). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples). Sigma_hat kept as default so the backend uses overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices reduce over-ordering given high on-hand while keeping service given confirmed L=4.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=586, in-transit=190. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 4; no new prolonged delays. Recent realized weekly demand has fallen from mid-year peaks to ~30\u2013120 units (last 8 concluded demands: 68,49,31,49,49,117,83,109 \u2014 note ordering of available samples ends at Period 37). To reflect the recent lower-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to variability, I use recent_N for demand mean and std over the last 8 samples. Keep L at promised/default (confirmed = 4 historically). These parameters bias the OR backend toward a moderate base stock that reduces holding cost exposure given high on-hand inventory while preserving service for near-term demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-722.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=749, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained, large decline in weekly demand since early Sept (Period 30). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. To avoid overstock given high holding cost (equal to profit), I keep L at the promised/default value (4) and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (captures Periods 30\u201338 where avg demand dropped). This biases the OR backend toward a much lower base-stock (reducing unnecessary holding) while preserving service given observed arrivals and consistent lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 30 (2019-09-02): avg demand over Periods 30\u201338 = 72.22 vs prior Periods 21\u201329 = 214.22 (\u2248 -66%), sustained over 9 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has shifted to a lower regime starting Period 30 (sustained ~10 periods: recent weekly demand samples = 117,109,83,117,68,49,31,49,27,26 \u2014 much lower than earlier). On-hand=723, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock now, no overdue arrivals to chase. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; I keep promised lead time to match OR backend assumptions. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility focus on the last 10 weeks and avoid overweighting the prior high-demand period. This reduces unnecessary future replenishment and holding cost while keeping service.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=698, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in the low-20s (Periods 31\u201340), confirming the downward regime that began at Period 30 (avg \u224872.2 earlier, now ~\u224840\u201330 and most recent ~25). Lead times observed in concluded history are consistently 4 periods. To avoid overstocking given high on-hand and sustained lower demand, set lead time to the empirically observed average and base mu/sigma on the recent low-demand regime (last 11 periods, Periods 30\u201340) so the OR backend reduces recommended replenishment vs using the long-run mean.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 30 (weekly demand mostly 12\u201383, recent weeks 26,25,12). On-hand=686, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock today; no overdue arrivals. Historical lead times consistently observed as 4 periods; promised LT=4. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set L to default (promised=4) and use recent_N=12 for demand mean and volatility (captures Periods 30\u201341 recent regime length). This biases orders toward lower forecasted demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service given high on-hand inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 30 (avg ~72.2 then falling further to recent weekly values mostly 12\u201364; carry-over notes document the regime shift). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods across many orders (confirmed arrivals with lead_time=4). To reflect the persistent lower-demand regime I use recent_N demand estimates over the post-changepoint window (Periods 30\u201342, length 13) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture current lower mean and volatility. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will equal 4 based on history) so the backend uses the empirically observed lead time. This keeps ordering conservative (matches actual LT) and reduces target base stock by using recent demand estimates to avoid excess holding cost given holding=profit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=559, in-transit=0. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 30 (recent demands P30\u2013P43 show sustained lower levels); most recent five demands: 26,25,12,64,63 (avg \u224838). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods and promised LT=4. To align stocking with the lower sustained demand while preserving service, use promised LT (default) and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime. I select recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full post-changepoint regime (Periods 30\u201343, length=14) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over that regime; this reduces overstock risk given ample on-hand inventory and equal profit/holding cost.

On-hand=547, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I set L to 'calculate' to use the confirmed observed lead time (avg=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (captures the current low-demand regime P36\u2013P44) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_recent and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_recent (both computed by backend).

To capture the sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (use N=16 covering Periods 30\u201345) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the current low-demand data.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=534, in-transit=0. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 30 (sustained low weekly demand through Period 46). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 in concluded history but backend knows promised lead time; keep L as default (promised). Use recent_N for demand estimates using the post-changepoint regime (Periods 30\u201346, 17 samples) so the (1+L)-period forecast reflects the sustained lower demand and avoids over-ordering given high on-hand inventory. Apply the same recent_N window for sigma to capture current lower volatility. These choices reduce holding cost risk while preserving service level for the current low-demand regime.
