Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed yet. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~78.6 units/week; no evidence of regime change or lead-time deviation. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std to set base-stock while avoiding premature manual overrides.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=112 (order placed P1) but that order concluded as arrived=0 for P1 so actual lead time not yet observed. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) available; no sustained changepoint. Use promised lead time (default) since no concluded arrivals to infer a different L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=254. No concluded arrival messages yet (orders from P1/P2 not expected to conclude until later), so actual lead time is unobserved; there is possible delayed/lost shipment risk but insufficient evidence to change L. Use default lead time (promised L=4). Historical sample mean demand = 78.6 (weeks: 77,59,67,78,112); default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean uses this history to capture typical demand over review+lead period. Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical variability. This balances service level (using full historical mean over 5 periods) while avoiding overreacting to currently unconfirmed shipment delays.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples average \u224878.6 units (samples: 77,59,67,78,112). No concluded arrivals in Periods 1-3 despite repeated orders, indicating shipment delays; to protect service level I increase assumed lead time and set explicit demand and volatility to cover (1+L) periods. Chosen L explicit=6 to buffer against delayed/lost shipments. mu_hat explicit set to 550.2 (\u2248(1+6)\xd778.6) to cover 7 periods of demand. sigma_hat explicit set to 54 to reflect sqrt(1+L) volatility amplification and recent demand variability. These parameters bias ordering upward to avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty while limiting excessive holding cost via conservative volatility estimate.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals in Periods 1-3 for orders placed in those periods; evidence of sustained shipment delays\u2014treat actual lead time as >4 until arrivals observed.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded demands (Periods 1-4) show a large upward shift vs. historical Jan samples (142,311,293,203 vs earlier ~78 avg). Shipments for orders placed in Periods 1-4 have not concluded \u2192 treat actual lead time longer than promised. I set L explicit=6 to be conservative against continued delays. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast on the four most recent concluded demand observations (Periods 1-4), capturing the new high-demand regime. These parameters increase order targets to protect service level despite shipment uncertainty while sigma_hat recent_N captures volatility of the new regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded arrivals show the Period 1 order (112 units) arrived in Period 5 with lead_time=4, so actual lead time=4 confirmed. On-hand=0, in-transit=890 (pipeline large). Use L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (observed=4). Demand history mean ~78.6/week; with L=4, use default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes base stock and cap using full-sample stats. This balances restoring service (pipeline + expected arrivals cover multi-week demand) while avoiding overstating demand given available in-transit units and known lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=974. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (Period1->P5, Period2->P6); use calculated lead time to reflect observed pattern. Recent demand has shifted materially above the older 2019-Jan samples (sustained high weekly demands ~200\u2013300 over the last 6 periods), so forecast demand using the last 6 periods to capture the new regime. Setting L=calculate uses observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=6) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std, increasing target base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while the large in-transit pipeline (974) reduces immediate ordering. This balances service level against holding cost given confirmed lead time and sustained demand uplift.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01. On-hand=0, in-transit=1043 (multiple concluded arrivals show previous delayed shipments now arriving; lead time confirmed as 4). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-7) is substantially higher than the early historical Jan samples, indicating a sustained upward demand regime. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=4) consistent with confirmed observations, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 7 periods to capture the new higher mean and volatility from the most relevant data. This increases target base-stock to improve service given high demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability so the OR backend can size safety stock appropriately.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019/4/8. SKU 372860002 has on-hand=0, in-transit=1301 and recent realized weekly demand has risen sharply (period demands: 142,311,293,203,201,239,354,385). Lead-time evidence already confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). I therefore use promised/default lead time to keep alignment with confirmed observations. Demand regime clearly shifted to the recent high-demand regime; I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from the most-relevant recent demand mean and volatility, balancing high service-level needs against holding cost given a long lead time and zero on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5272.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand has been substantially higher since Period 5 (periods 5-9 demands = 201,239,354,385,282) versus the historical low-January samples (mean ~78.6). On-hand=86, in-transit=1270 (sizable pipeline). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history, matching the promise. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (4). To capture the new higher-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat (uses last 5 demand samples, periods 5-9) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect increased volatility. These choices direct the OR backend to raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to protect service without overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 5: avg demand increased from ~78.6 (Jan samples) to 292.2 (Periods 5-9), +272%, sustained for 5 periods

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): historical conclude messages show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed P1..P6 arrived after 4 periods). Demand regime shifted at Period 5: recent periods (P5\u2013P9) average \u2248292.2/week vs. pre-shift ~78.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=1433 (pipeline large). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the consistent 4-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 5 demand samples). Sigma also recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. These choices bias base-stock toward the higher recent mean while letting the OR backend cap orders via its cap to avoid overordering given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders observed with W=4). Demand has shifted up starting Period 5 and has been sustained through Period 11 (recent demands: 201,239,354,385,282,382,472; mean \u2248331). To match confirmed lead time and recent high-demand regime, set L by averaging observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 (captures the post-shift regime over Periods 5-11). This provides the OR engine a forecast covering (1+L) periods of the new demand level while using recent volatility for safety against stockouts given large in-transit volume.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=1631. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1-P8 arrived after 4 periods). Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 5: recent high-demand periods (P5-P12) avg \u2248292.2 vs Jan avg \u224878.6. I therefore keep L at promised/default (4) since confirmed by concluded arrivals, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (use last 8 concluded demand samples from the high-demand regime) so the OR backend targets base stock appropriate for the sustained higher demand while accounting for observed variability. This also leverages the large in-transit position (1631) so ordering will be moderated by the capped policy.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13): on-hand=76, in-transit=1742. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 5 (higher mean from Periods 5-13). Pipeline (1742) plus on-hand covers upcoming demand, but recent elevated demand levels warrant using recent-sample estimates. L: use default (promised lead time=4) since concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=9 (covering the confirmed high-demand regime Periods 5\u201313) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the new regime. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=9 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) while avoiding inflated safety stock from old low-demand data.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (higher weekly demand ~292 vs ~78 prior) and lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods. On-hand=177, in-transit=1560 so pipeline is healthy. I keep L=default (promised lead time=4) since concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime: choose N=10 (Periods 5-14) to capture the new mean and volatility for (1+L) periods. This biases base_stock up to meet the higher sustained demand while sigma recent_N captures current variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (avg ~292+), recent weeks demand ~300-470; on-hand=263, in-transit=1373 (ample pipeline). Past concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. To reflect confirmed LT and recent sustained demand shift I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 5\u201315, regime length=11). This biases the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent data captures current volatility; large pipeline reduces urgency to inflate orders further.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P1\u2192P5 etc.), so use promised/default lead time. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift beginning Period 5 (higher mean sustained through Periods 5\u201316); to capture the new regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime. On-hand (353) + in-transit (1247) is ample but we still target high service (profit/holding => high q) so using recent demand stats avoids under-forecasting from older low-Jan samples. Methods chosen: L=default to reflect confirmed promised lead time, mu_hat=recent_N and sigma_hat=recent_N using the recent regime length (N=12) which covers Periods 5\u201316 and meets the N selection rules.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Demand has remained in the higher regime confirmed at Period 5 (sustained elevated weekly demand since then). On-hand=533, in-transit=1186 (total pipeline=1719) \u2014 ample coverage for several weeks but shipments have stabilized with observed lead time = 4 historically. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime using the last 13 periods since Period 5 (regime length = 13) so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 13 samples). Sigma_hat uses recent_N with the same N=13 to reflect current volatility. This emphasizes service (high profit) while keeping holding cost in the capped order calculation.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed P1..P14 all arrived after 4 periods) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 5 (mean increased substantially and persisted). To reflect confirmed lead time and the new demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N for demand stats covering the entire post-shift regime (Periods 5\u201318, N=14) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher sustained demand and its volatility. This keeps the OR base-stock aligned with the higher demand while letting the capped order cap limit excess ordering to control holding cost given Profit=$19 vs Holding=$1.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand regime shifted at Period 5 to a higher mean (~292/week) sustained through recent periods; use recent regime data to forecast. Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. Use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base demand across review+lead on the 15-period post-shift regime (captures elevated mean and volatility), which helps the OR engine size base stock to meet higher service levels while keeping holding costs in check given high profit/holding ratio.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=183, in-transit=1360. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (Periods 5-20 arrivals show lead_time=4); use recent demand rather than Jan baseline because demand jumped mid-March and remained elevated. I set L=default to use the promised (and empirically confirmed) 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (last 8 periods) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime visible since Period 5 and reflected in recent weeks, so mu_hat and sigma_hat will be computed from the most recent 8 samples; this balances service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) against inventory cost by sizing base stock to recent realized demand and its variability.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period 22 (2019-07-08). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in conclude messages P5..P21). On-hand=214, in-transit=1381 \u2014 pipeline is large. Demand regime shift at Period 5 raised mean demand substantially and has persisted through recent periods, so forecast should use the post-shift data. I set L=default to use promised lead time (4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=17 (regime_length from Period 5\u201321 = 17) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent high-demand regime; this balances higher service level needed under the sustained demand increase while avoiding over-weighting older low-demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6301.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime confirmed at Period 10 (shift from ~79 to ~292 since Period 5) and observed lead times have consistently been 4 periods. Current on-hand=26, in-transit=1639 (ample pipeline). I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime observed since Period 5 while smoothing older low-season samples; this keeps base_stock responsive to the higher demand and limits excessive holding by using a recent-window estimate.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=210, in-transit=1529 (ample pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders from P1-P24 all concluded with W=4). Demand regime shifted up at Period 5 and has persisted; recent periods (P5-P24) form the current high-demand regime. I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (capture the sustained high-demand regime from P5 onward) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap using the current regime mean/variance. This raises target inventory to support higher demand while holding cost is low relative to profit ($1 vs $19), balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (sustained elevated weekly demand through Period 25). Recent on-hand 352 + in-transit 1353 provides strong cover vs. expected demand. Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods in history (evidence: multiple orders with lead_time=4), so use the promised/default lead time. To capture the confirmed post-Period-5 demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent data from that regime: use recent_N with N=20 (regime length since Period 5 is \u226520). This biases forecast to the higher recent mean and variance, improving service while keeping holding cost in check given ample pipeline inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 5 (sustained higher demand thereafter). Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods since Period 5. Current on-hand=521, in-transit=1208 so pipeline is healthy. I set L to default (promised lead time=4) since observed lead time equals promised. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-shift regime (regime length >20) so mu_hat uses the (1+L)-scaled mean of the most recent 20 demand samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This balances high service (captures elevated post-shift demand) while limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Historical concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders with lead_time=4). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting at Period 5 (avg increased to ~292/week) and that higher-demand regime persists through recent periods. On-hand = 649 and in-transit = 1098 provide substantial pipeline cover. I set L via calculate to confirm observed lead time from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use most recent 20 samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean). Sigma uses recent_N N=20 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices align the OR backend's base-stock and cap calculations to the confirmed higher-demand regime and the observed 4-period lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given the large pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=805, in-transit=940; confirmed actual lead time=4 from history. Demand regime shifted up at Period 5 and has remained elevated; use recent data to reflect current higher mean/volatility. Set L to promised (default=4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures last 20 demand samples since the regime change, capped per rules) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and current variability accurately while avoiding overweighting old low-demand January samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand and substantial pipeline) against holding cost by basing targets on the recent high-demand regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (observed repeatedly P1\u2192P5 etc.). On-hand=838, in-transit=888 \u2014 healthy pipeline but demand since Period 5 jumped ~+272% vs Jan and has been sustained; recent weeks demand around 200. I set L to default (promised=4) consistent with confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-regime mean over the most recent 20 samples (reduces influence of the low-Jan samples). Sigma set recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility rather than the full-sample std. These choices supply the OR backend with lead time =4 and demand estimates focused on the new higher-demand regime, balancing service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given current high on-hand and pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=912, in-transit=820. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; inventory is ample vs recent demand. Recent demand (Periods 25-30) shows a downward drift (266,239,221,208,199,189) vs earlier high regime; to reflect the most recent demand level I use a recent_N estimate based on the last 6 demand samples so the backend computes (1+L)*mean over the recent regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) to capture current volatility. L set to default (promised/confirmed 4) to keep timing aligned with observed arrivals and the OR engine assumptions. These parameters bias toward lower replenishment reflecting falling demand while the high profit/holding ratio maintains a high service quantile internally.

Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 consistently. To keep orders responsive to the recent lower demand while respecting observed LT=4, set L by calculation from observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the last ~2 months of demand history. This reduces excess inventory risk while preserving service given current high on-hand + pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Demand has been in the higher regime confirmed at Period 10 (sustained since Period 5); recent realized weekly demand has been much larger than Jan baseline. On-hand=999 and in-transit=195 gives ample coverage versus (1+L) periods of demand, so avoid aggressive uplifts. Set L to default (promised lead time=4) because lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 in concluded history. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean). Use recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while relying on recent regime data and current large on-hand to avoid excess ordering.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (carry-over: avg \u2248292.2), and concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. On-hand = 977, in-transit = 422 (ample coverage). I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (4) which matches observed concluded arrivals. For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (regime length >>20); this yields (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent 20 demand samples so the OR engine builds base stock around the elevated demand. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize service (high q from profit/holding) while using recent data to avoid underforecasting the persistent higher demand; with current high on-hand + pipeline the policy will likely cap orders, limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=808, in-transit=729. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods and stable demand since the large regime shift around Period 5. No new sustained changepoint detected in recent periods; pipeline plus on-hand substantially covers demand. Use default promised lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned with observed confirmations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, letting the OR engine produce the capped order that balances high unit profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1). This keeps service levels high while avoiding unnecessary explicit overrides given stable recent arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders from prior periods arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=691 and in-transit=891 provide ample coverage vs recent demand (117\u2013169 last two periods). No new, sustained demand regime or lead-time change detected.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand (Periods 31-37) has averaged ~170 units/week (sequence: 168,136,234,217,169,117,150), lower than the earlier high regime; I therefore base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 7 samples to capture the current lower-demand regime. Lead time has been historically confirmed as 4 periods; although the last three shipments expected after Periods 34-36 showed arrived=0 (possible delays/loss), this is not yet conclusively a permanent lead-time shift\u2014so I keep L at the promised default. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR base-stock on the current demand level, reducing overstock risk given high on-hand (541) + in-transit (994).

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 34-36 produced arrived=0 when they were expected (three consecutive missed expected arrivals), indicating a possible new shipment delay/loss starting with orders placed in Period 34; monitor for confirmation.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=832, in-transit=572. Recent history: orders placed in Periods 35-37 have not yet concluded but Period 34's shipment just concluded with lead_time=4, and historical concluded lead times are consistently 4. Given no new sustained lead-time shift and a confirmed demand regime change earlier, use the promised lead time and full-sample demand stats so the OR engine leverages all historical evidence. Defaults keep the backend's (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std calculations, balancing service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) with holding costs while remaining robust to transient missed arrivals.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = promised 4 (multiple orders observed arriving with W=4). On-hand=1053, in-transit=520 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is ample vs recent weekly demand (historical weeks show demand mostly ~100-400 with a sustained higher regime earlier). No new sustained changepoint detected. Use default lead time to keep backend aligned with contract (L=promised). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it incorporate the confirmed lead time and full demand history to balance service level (high profit/low holding cost favors service) against holding cost given current ample inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded messages (multiple orders with lead_time=4); no new sustained deviation since Period 38 arrivals returned to on-time. Inventory is high (on-hand 1135 + in-transit 410). To keep the OR engine aligned with observed delivery performance and use the full historical demand signal, I set lead time to be calculated from observed lead times and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat at defaults so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (using confirmed L=4) while avoiding overfitting recent short-term noise given ample on-hand stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple confirmed arrivals with lead_time=4). A demand regime shift was previously confirmed at Period 5 (sustained higher mean). On-hand=953, in-transit=485 gives healthy pipeline but we keep safety for demand variability. Set L to promised/confirmed lead time (4). For demand forecast use recent data from the post-shift regime: use recent_N with N=20 (captures the latest 20 demand samples within the high-demand regime to reflect current mean). For sigma use recent_N N=20 to capture current volatility. These choices keep the backend's base_stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while using recent variance to avoid overstocking given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Current on-hand=1139, in-transit=230. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P5\u2013P41 arrivals), and recent missed-then-late arrivals resolved (no new sustained loss). Demand has settled at lower weekly values in recent months (~60\u2013180 range) after the earlier mid-year spike; with lead time confirmed as 4, use the OR defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This balances service level (profit $19 vs hold $1) by letting the optimizer set base stock and cap using full-sample statistics while accounting for the promised 4-period lead time. No explicit corrections for lost shipments are applied since concluded history aligns with L=4.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=1131, in-transit=386. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 for many orders (Period 6 confirmation and subsequent arrivals at lag 4), and recent missed-then-later arrivals (Periods 34-40) resolved with 4-period lag; therefore use promised/default lead time. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 5 (much higher mean than early Jan). To capture the post-shift demand while remaining robust to recent variability, I use recent_N (most recent regime) with N=20 (regime length >20 so capped at 20). Using recent demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances service level (capture elevated mean) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory; the OR backend will translate these into base-stock and cap using the profit/holding ratio.

There was a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (confirmed previously) so I base demand forecast on recent data. Set L to promised (default) to match observed confirmed lead time. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short noise; this biases orders toward service (higher mu_hat) but keeps volatility estimate from older low-demand periods, balancing profit vs holding cost given low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Set L to default (promised 4) to keep OR backend aligned with supplier promise and historical confirmations. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the last 5 weeks where demand settled around ~116 units/week, reducing overweighting from the earlier large spike (Periods 5-9). This keeps base_stock responsive to the current lower-demand regime while limiting holding cost given high on-hand inventory.
