  "rationale": "World/calendar: No major seasonal event on 2019-12-30 affecting this accessory beyond year-end; use recent demand. Demand analysis: last 5 observed weekly demands (P42\u2013P46) = [115, 50, 83, 127, 100], average \u224895 units/week. Lead time & pipeline: lead time confirmed = 4 periods; need to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Inventory check: on-hand=41 + in-transit=362 = 403 units available. Coverage needed \u2248 95\xd75 = 475 units \u2192 shortfall \u2248 72 units. Order decision: place enough to cover the ~5-period shortfall plus small buffer; order 80 units to reduce stockout risk while limiting holding cost given holding = profit. ",
