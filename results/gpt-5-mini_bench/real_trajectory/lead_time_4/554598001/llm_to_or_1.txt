Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean demand declining across the five weeks but no concluded arrivals or observed lead times to override the promised lead time. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover review+lead. Use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014conservative given limited signal and no confirmed lead-time changes.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand history mean = 53 units/week (5 samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=79 (ordered Period 1 but not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals observed \u2192 do NOT infer lead-time change or lost order. Use promised lead time to be conservative. Set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and std; this acknowledges pipeline (79) is currently short of the (1+L)-period demand forecast and lets OR compute recommended order considering profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent observed weekly demands (historical samples) average 53 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=155 which equals two prior orders (79+76) that have not yet concluded \u2014 suggests delayed arrivals but only 2 periods of missing deliveries (not yet 3+), so insufficient sustained evidence to change lead-time estimate. Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates: default L (promised=4) and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps orders sized to cover review+lead demand while relying on backend cap; avoids overreacting to a short run of missed arrivals while keeping pipeline coverage in mind.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Historical demand mean from samples = 53 units/week (2019-01 data). Recent periods (P1\u2013P3) show orders placed (79,76,110) but zero arrivals in concludes and on-hand=0 while in-transit=265 \u2192 shipments delayed beyond promised 4 periods. Because no concluded arrivals exist to compute an observed lead time and multiple shipments remain outstanding, I conservatively extend lead time to 6 to cover additional delay risk and to let the OR backend size pipeline coverage. Using default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean) keeps the backend consistent with its calculation; default volatility is used. This increases target base-stock to improve service (reduce expected lost sales) while accepting higher holding cost given the profit/holding ratio ($4 profit vs $1 holding).

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments confirmed: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (79,76,110) all show arrived=0 in concludes; in-transit=265 \u2014 implies actual lead time > promised 4 periods and sustained delay across 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 .. 2019-02-04) have mean=53. Observed concludes show sustained missing/delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (79,76,110,109) all arrived=0 and in-transit=374, indicating actual lead time exceeds the promised 4 periods. To protect service level while accounting for likely prolonged delay, I set L explicitly longer than promised so the backend will build a larger (1+L) demand cover. Using default mu_hat/sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, keeping forecasting simple and stable given limited recent demand variability data.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed prolonged shipment delays: orders from Periods 1\u20134 (79,76,110,109) all arrived=0 in concludes; in-transit=374 \u2014 actual lead time > promised 4 periods and delay persisted across 4 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concludes show one arrival: Period5 conclude reports arrived=79 (ordered P1) => observed lead time = 4. On-hand=24, in-transit=400; several earlier orders showed delayed arrivals but P1 arrival confirms actual lead time equals promised 4 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). Demand history (samples: 78,58,47,42,40) is limited and shows no clear regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level given profit/holding (profit=4, holding=1) while letting OR engine account for observed lead time and full sample statistics. 

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period5 conclude: order from Period1 arrived in Period5, lead_time=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6). On-hand=53, in-transit=324 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly mean demand (~53 units/week). Use lead time estimation from observed data and population demand stats: set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps base-stock anchored to historical mean demand (5\xd7\u224853=265 units) while acknowledging confirmed lead time and avoiding overreaction to recent delivery noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period5, Period2 order arrived in Period6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P3 arrived with lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=80, in-transit=214. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable historical weekly demand samples (mean=53 units/week from provided 5 samples), use lead time estimate based on observed lead times and default demand stats so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and std over all samples. This balances a high service target (profit/ (profit+holding) = 0.8) while avoiding explicit manual scaling given limited new demand evidence and no new sustained regime shifts. No new missing-shipment pattern beyond the confirmed LT=4 that requires explicit adjustment.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived in P5\u2013P8 with lead_time=4). On-hand=134, in-transit=163; pipeline + on-hand covers several periods of demand. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean=53 units. I set L by calculated observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4 so the backend uses measured LT rather than the promised/default. For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to capture the multi-period demand over review+lead. For sigma_hat I use default so volatility is scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices align the OR engine's base-stock computation with observed 4-period lead time while using the full-sample demand stats to balance service level (profit $4 vs hold $1 implies moderately high fill target) against holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent weekly demand has been variable but centered near historical mean (~53 units/week). On-hand=211, in-transit=109 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=320 units, which exceeds (1+L)*mean demand for L=4 (5*~53=265), so no aggressive uplift is needed. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages; demand shows no sustained changepoint over the available history. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and the backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample stats and balances service vs. holding cost conservatively.

Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=168, in-transit=126. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple orders from P1\u2013P5 all arrived with lead_time=4), so I set L to be the calculated average of observed lead times (will be 4). Demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb historical series provided) show no sustained recent regime shift; use default forecasting that scales the full-sample mean by (1+L). Volatility likewise use default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR backend compute safety stock. These settings keep orders aligned with confirmed L=4 while balancing profit vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent realized weekly demand has been ~50 units (last 5 demands: 83,55,28,43,41; mean=50). On-hand=127 + in-transit=163 => pipeline total 290, which comfortably covers (1+L)\xd7mean for L=4 (~250). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (matches observed confirmation). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime (mean ~50) and limit influence of older Jan data. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These parameters keep base-stock focused on current demand while avoiding overreacting to older outliers, balancing service level and holding cost given plentiful pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=144, in-transit=105; recent conclude messages show orders arriving with lead_time=4 consistently (Periods 5\u20139 confirms). No evidence of ongoing lost shipments. Demand history (provided samples + recent period demand) supports using the confirmed lead time=4. Profit/holding ratio implies high target service level (q\u22480.8) so aim to use backend's statistical defaults. I select L by calculation from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level needs vs. holding cost given current healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand (Periods 5\u201313) shows sustained weekly demand around ~40\u201355 with one spike (83 in P7); current on-hand=164, in-transit=125. Historical conclude messages consistently show 4-period actual lead time. I set L by 'calculate' to use observed lead-time data (avg=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 5\u201313) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand and sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=9) to capture recent volatility. This keeps service high given current inventory while avoiding excess holding cost by basing forecasts on recent observed demand rather than older low-Jan samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent realized demand has been moderate but variable; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201314) = [43,41,41,31,67], mean \u2248 44.6. On-hand=114, in-transit=108 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand =222, enough for ~5 weeks at recent mean. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed observed to arrive after 4 periods). I therefore use L='default' (promised lead time=4). To make the base-stock responsive to the recent regime rather than older Jan samples, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent demand level and variability). This balances service (covers ~5-period demand with L+1 factor) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit $4 per unit.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, etc.), so use promised/default lead time. Use default demand estimates based on all provided samples (mean weekly demand \u224853); default mu_hat and sigma_hat let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (maintain coverage over review+lead window) versus holding cost given modest holding penalty.

On-hand=6, in-transit=269 (large pipeline). I choose default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std: this leverages the confirmed LT=4 and conservative baseline demand while the large in-transit reduces need for aggressive ordering, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Recent demand shows a clear upward shift over the last 3 periods (demands 43,92,131) \u2014 treat as a new short-lived higher-demand regime and use recent data to forecast. Therefore: L method=default (promised 4). mu_hat use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent spike (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 demands). sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher service (higher mu_hat) to avoid stockouts during the recent demand surge while using recent volatility to limit excessive safety stock.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=299. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Recent weekly demand appears higher than the small Jan sample; to capture the current summer demand regime I use recent demand statistics. I select L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to prioritize the most recent demand pattern and limit influence of the sparse Jan samples. This raises the target base_stock to better cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while the OR backend will cap orders; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given zero on-hand and large in-transit) against holding cost.

Demand in recent periods is elevated and volatile (several weeks >100 units), but long-run sample set is limited; to avoid overfitting to short spikes while respecting confirmed lead time, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat to the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine uses the full historical demand to compute base stock and safety.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods. Demand has entered a sustained higher regime starting Period 19: Periods 19\u201324 demands = [92,131,142,133,141,146] (avg \u2248131 over 6 periods). I therefore keep L at promised/default (4) and set demand estimates using the most recent regime (recent_N with N=6) to capture the higher mean and volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR backend on the elevated demand so base-stock will increase service while avoiding excessive inventory from older low-demand data. This addresses overdue shipment risk (none currently outstanding beyond confirmed 4-period LT) by relying on accurate LT and updated demand stats.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: avg demand increased to 130.8 (Periods 19\u201324) from historical baseline (~54), +142% \u2014 sustained for 6 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=5, in-transit=366 (large pipeline). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 19 (Periods 19\u201324 avg \u2248130.8). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirming 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 19\u201324) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the elevated mean and support a higher service level given profit=$4 vs holding=$1 (q\u22480.8). This balances avoiding stockouts in the new regime while acknowledging sizable pipeline inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 19 (Periods 19\u201326 avg demand ~130.8 vs historical ~54). On-hand=6, in-transit=387 (large pipeline). Actual lead time has repeatedly been 4 periods in concluded messages. I therefore keep L at the promised/default value (4). For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime to capture the new mean/volatility: use N=8 (Periods 19\u201326) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets higher base stock and accounts for higher variability while the large in-transit pipeline limits aggressive fresh ordering.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 19 (~130.8 avg, P19\u2013P24) and recent weeks (P22\u2013P27) remain high (133,141,146,157,136,118). On-hand=0, in-transit=547 (covers several weeks of elevated demand but arrivals will only be visible next period). Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; I keep promised/default lead time. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime samples (N=6, the confirmed post-changepoint window P22\u2013P27) so the OR engine sizes base stock to meet elevated demand while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service level (reduce stockouts in high-demand regime) vs holding cost by not reverting to low historical mean.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26): on-hand=0, in-transit=650. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 19 (much higher weekly demand, avg ~130+). Pipeline (650) covers several weeks but current on-hand is zero so we must plan against the elevated demand regime. I set L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead-time average (confirmed = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods 19\u201328, regime length=10) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 samples. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to measure volatility from the same high-demand window. These settings focus the OR backend on the new higher demand, while relying on confirmed lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering given the empty on-hand and large in-transit exposure.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02): on-hand=0, in-transit=554. Recent concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; demand has shifted up starting Period 19 (sustained high weekly sales). I keep L at the promised/default (4) since observed lead times match promised. For demand I use recent_N (N=11) to capture the post-change regime (Periods 19\u201329) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent and sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets service for the new higher-demand regime while avoiding stocking to an outdated low-demand mean, and the in-transit 554 units will be counted in pipeline when computing orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to the promised/default (4). Use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (periods 19\u201330) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the 12 most recent high-demand samples. This increases target base_stock to meet the new regime while keeping volatility estimated from the same window to set safety stock appropriately.

Chose recent_N with N=14 (Periods 19\u201332) to capture the sustained higher mean and recent variability; this raises the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma from the same window controls safety stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=182 and in-transit=418 provides substantial coverage vs. current demand, but OR should target the elevated regime when setting forecast. Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods in history, so use promised/default lead time. For demand forecasting, use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean and volatility; I choose N=14 (Periods 19\u201332 inclusive) per the regime length. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher-demand regime so the backend's base-stock balances service level against holding cost given the large pipeline.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime that began at Period 19 (sustained higher weekly demand ~130.8). On-hand=284, in-transit=342 \u2014 pipeline ample vs. high demand but no outstanding missing shipments (arrivals consistently confirm 4-period lead time). Set L by observed history (actual lead time = 4). For demand, use recent_N to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use N=17, covering Periods 19\u201335) so mu_hat reflects the new mean over review+lead and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This keeps service high during the sustained demand increase while avoiding excessive safety stock driven by older low-demand samples.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows a persistent, higher demand regime since Period 19 (sustained elevated weekly sales). Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 periods (concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4). Current stock: on-hand=261, in-transit=336 (total pipeline=597) which is ample coverage but demand remains elevated; to keep service while controlling holding cost I use the promised lead time and base stock driven by recent demand samples (focus on most recent 20 weeks) to reflect the elevated regime and its volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 19 (avg demand \u2248130.8 over Periods 19\u201324 and remained elevated thereafter). Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=282, in-transit=270 (total pipeline=552) which covers multiple weeks of elevated demand; to keep service while avoiding excess holding cost I use a lead time estimate confirmed by concluded arrivals and base forecast anchored to the recent high-demand regime. Therefore: L set by calculation of observed lead times (reflects confirmed L=4); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N to focus the forecast and volatility on the post-changepoint regime (N chosen to cover the recent regime length), which biases the base-stock toward meeting the sustained higher demand without relying on older low-demand samples.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has fallen from the large spike observed in Periods 19\u201329; last 6 observed demands (Periods 34\u201339 conclude window) average lower and inventory is ample (on-hand=338, in-transit=271). No new sustained lead-time signal (past history consistently shows actual lead time = 4). To avoid overstock while meeting near-term demand, use promised lead time and estimate demand from the recent window. Set L=default (promised 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility and reduce safety stock relative to the earlier high-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=348, in-transit=200. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 19 (sustained higher weekly demand); to capture the recent higher mean/volatility I use recent_N over the last 20 samples. Use promised/default lead time to match observed stable LT=4. These parameters bias orders toward service (reduce stockouts) while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit excess holding.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand (Periods 36\u201340 = 80,88,49,61,28; mean=61.2) is well below the earlier summer spike; historical evidence (Periods 19\u201324) shows a prior sustained spike but that resolved. On-hand=371, in-transit=242 provides ample short-term coverage. Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages, so use promised/default L. To align ordering to current lower recent demand and reduce holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current regime while keeping safety buffer computed by OR backend.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). On-hand=367 + in-transit=199 provides ample coverage vs. current high-demand regime (regime shift at Period 19; elevated mean since). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg observed = 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime since Period 19 while limiting older low-demand data influence. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock tuned to the higher recent demand while using confirmed lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering and excessive stockouts.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Current on-hand=409, in-transit=130 \u2014 ample coverage versus recent weekly demand (recent weeks ~40\u201390). Historical data shows a past sustained demand regime shift around Period 19 (already recorded) but recent weeks do not show a new sustained change. Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (no new evidence of delays). To keep the OR backend aligned with promised operations and long-run demand stats, I use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimates so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using full historical mean) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand regime (Periods 19\u201343) is much higher (~130 avg) than early baseline (~54); lead times have consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. Current on-hand=392, in-transit=130 gives ample cover short-term but demand remains elevated. Set L to promised/default (4) since concluded lead times =4. Use recent_N for demand stats to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (changepoint at Period 19); regime length since P19 is 25, cap N at 20 per rules, so N=20. Use recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward meeting the higher service-level implied by the new regime while controlling holding cost by using recent stats.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages; no recent evidence of change, so use promised/default lead time. Recent weeks (Periods 41\u201345) show a sharp drop (47,64,17,17,21) consistent with year-end/holiday demand softness; to balance service vs holding cost I down-weight older high-demand regime while still retaining memory of prior higher season by using an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3). Keep sigma_hat at default to reflect full-sample volatility. This reduces aggressive ordering during the holiday lull and avoids excess holding cost given already-large on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=469, in-transit=39. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders with lead_time=4); no recent evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 43-46 = 17,17,21,15) is well below the earlier summer spike; I therefore keep L as promised (default) and set demand forecast using the most recent periods to capture the current low December demand. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=4 (uses last 4 demands) and sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect current low mean and low volatility; these parameters reduce ordering to avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory while preserving service given available stock.
