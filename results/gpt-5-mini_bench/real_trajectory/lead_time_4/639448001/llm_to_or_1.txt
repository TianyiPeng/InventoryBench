Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/02/11. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward regime starting 2019-01-21 (22,71,102) vs prior weeks (2,1). On-hand and in-transit are zero so we must replenish for upcoming demand under the promised lead time. I use default lead time (promised=4) because no concluded arrivals to infer an actual lead-time change. For demand I target the recent high regime: use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean and volatility from 2019-01-21 \u2192 2019-02-04. This biases the OR base-stock toward higher service (reducing stockouts) while keeping variability estimated from the same recent window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: prior mean (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14)=1.5 units; recent mean (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04)=65.0 units (3-week sustained increase).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent data show a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent 3-sample mean = 65 units vs prior mean 1.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=132 (ordered P1, not yet concluded) so pipeline exists but arrival confirmation pending. Use promised lead time (default) since no concluded arrivals to recompute actual L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (3 most recent samples: 22,71,102). This increases target base-stock to meet higher demand while the cap protects against over-ordering given pipeline uncertainty.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand regime: sustained increase beginning 2019-01-21 (samples: 22,71,102; mean=65). On-hand=0, in-transit=244 (matches orders placed P1=132, P2=112; no concluded arrivals yet). No concluded arrivals -> cannot infer actual lead time, so use promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent high-demand regime (last 3 samples) to capture the new mean and volatility; this ensures the OR backend targets ~5-period demand (1+L) based on the elevated demand, improving service while acknowledging holding cost via sigma-based safety stock.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=373; no concluded arrivals yet so no confirmed lead-time change. Recent demand in the most recent 3 periods (86, 118, 55) indicates a higher run-rate than the older 2019-01 samples. Use promised lead time (no concluded evidence to change L). Forecast demand using the most recent 3 periods to capture the new regime; set sigma to recent volatility over the same window. This balances service (captures elevated recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=491. Historical concludes show no arrivals yet but that is expected given promised L=4 (arrivals for recent orders will only appear in future concludes); no concluded evidence of changed lead time or new demand regime beyond the previously recorded Jan shift. To let the OR engine use its default statistical aggregation (and because we lack concluded arrivals to adjust L or pipeline), use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (use full-sample demand) against holding cost without overreacting to unconfirmed arrival delays.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=83, in-transit=359. Historical concluded arrivals show an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time=4). Recent realized demand (Periods 3-5 = 55,55,49) suggests a stable recent mean ~53. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period actual lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to target the most recent demand regime (uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over last 3 samples). This balances service (covering current + pipeline demand over 5 periods) against holding cost given high on-hand and in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Demand regime shift confirmed starting 2019-01-21: recent weekly mean = 65 units (weeks 2019-01-21..2019-02-04). Lead time confirmed as 4 periods from concluded arrivals (Period1\u2192Period5, Period2\u2192Period6). On-hand=170 + in-transit=247 = 417 units, which comfortably covers (1+L)*recent_mean \u2248 5*65=325. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I set L=default (use promised/confirmed 4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to anchor forecast on the 3-period high-demand regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to a base stock appropriate for the new higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent on-hand=244, in-transit=118. Historical demand samples show a clear upward regime starting 2019-01-21; observed concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (three observations). To align OR backend with confirmed lead time I select L by calculation from observed lead times. Use default demand/volatility preprocessing so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects the sustained higher demand while the backend's cap limits extreme orders. This also avoids overfitting short-term noise given available sample count and preserves safety against delayed/lost shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=301, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs. (1+L)-period demand from historical samples and confirmed post-2019-01-21 higher regime. Use lead-time estimate from observed data (calculate). Use default demand/volatility (all samples) so backend computes base-stock and cap consistently; with high on-hand no immediate replenishment needed and this balances service vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=264, in-transit=36 (total pipeline=300) after recent arrivals; demand history shows the sustained higher regime identified earlier (post-2019-01-21). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior periods, so use the promised/default lead time. To reflect the confirmed demand regime while using most available recent evidence, set mu_hat via recent_N over the last 9 observed demand periods (captures current elevated demand pattern). Keep sigma_hat as default to let the backend scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to size base stock to meet service for the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute the safety stock given observed volatility and the promised lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand (Periods 5-10) = [49,25,55,61,37,35] shows a sustained elevated regime vs pre-2019-01-21; on-hand=229, in-transit=102 (total pipeline=331) which covers multiple periods of demand. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods (confirmed in prior concludes). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed value. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (last 6 demand observations) so mu_hat reflects the current post-change regime and (1+L) coverage; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to capture current volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the new higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples, and they account for confirmed lead time so the backend orders appropriately against the pipeline to balance service level and holding cost.

Recent demand has stabilized after the Jan regime shift; current inventory is ample vs. expected 5-period coverage. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance while respecting the confirmed L=4 and current high pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has stabilized since the large regime shift (weeks starting 2019-01-21) \u2014 recent sold series (Periods 5\u201312) = [49,25,55,61,37,35,20,50]. On-hand=159, in-transit=102 (total pipeline 261) which is ample vs recent weekly demand ~42\u201350. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history (consistent arrivals P5\u2013P8). I choose L using calculate to reflect observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to base mu_hat on the most recent consistent regime (Periods 5\u201312) so the base-stock targets recent higher demand rather than older low samples. I also set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture current volatility. These choices keep service high (q ~0.8 given profit/holding) while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples and accounting for confirmed LT=4 and current healthy pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent history shows the sustained higher-demand regime that began 2019-01-21 persists (recent weekly demands ~49,25,55,61,37,35,20,50,44). On-hand=151, in-transit=66; pipeline plus on-hand provides good cover vs. short-term demand but we must keep base-stock tied to the recent higher regime. Lead time has consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages, so use observed average. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 9 demand samples to reflect the post-changepoint regime and recent volatility, which prevents under-ordering while avoiding excessive holding cost given current healthy inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent demand has remained at the elevated regime identified earlier (multiple weeks of 20\u201361 units; last 8 demands: 37,35,20,50,44,45,?,? \u2014 using the most recent 8-week window to capture current variability). On-hand=172 and in-transit=18 provide substantial coverage but we keep forecasting conservative to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history so use promised/default lead time. Use recent_N for mu_hat (N=8) to weight the elevated demand regime rather than long-run low-demand history. Keep sigma_hat default to let backend scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). This setup biases ordering toward meeting the sustained higher demand while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained increase). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=112, in-transit=103 (pipeline ample). I set L to default (promised 4) consistent with observed confirmations. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime and avoid dilution by the two very-low early samples. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to service the sustained higher demand while keeping holding risk managed by using a recent-sample estimate rather than all-time higher variance.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=84, in-transit=126; no overdue arrivals beyond confirmed shipments. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (evidence in conclude messages). Demand regime shifted upward starting 2019-01-21 and recent weeks show stable elevated demand. Therefore set L to be inferred from observations (calculate). Use recent demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new regime and recent volatility; chosen N=8 (captures the most recent two months of weekly data to estimate (1+L)-period demand and variability). These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to protect service while using recent variability to limit excess holding given $1 holding vs $4 profit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained increase). Current inventory: on-hand=55, in-transit=140 (total pipeline=195) which comfortably covers several weeks at current demand; no recent missing arrivals. I keep L as default (promised lead time=4, previously confirmed). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent weeks, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat to focus the mean on recent demand (N=10). I keep sigma_hat at default to let the backend scale variability over (1+L). This balances service (capture elevated mean) versus holding costs given sizable pipeline.

Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=66, in-transit=187. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime increase since 2019-01-21. To keep safety stock responsive to the higher, sustained demand while respecting the confirmed lead time, I use the promised/default lead time (confirmed as 4) and recent_N demand estimates (N=10) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 10 demand observations rather than older low-volume samples. This balances service (capture current higher mean) vs holding cost by using recent volatility for safety sizing.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=147 and in-transit=102 (pipeline=249) \u2014 ample coverage vs. expected 5-period demand. I set L explicit=4 to lock in confirmed lead time. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21; to capture recent behavior I request mu_hat recent_N with N=10 (focus on the last 10 demand samples). Volatility will use default to let the backend scale std across the 5-period horizon. These settings keep service by reflecting recent demand while avoiding excess ordering given large existing pipeline, balancing profit ($4) vs holding ($1).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent observed demand has declined from the earlier high-regime (Feb\u2013May) to much lower weekly sales in the most recent 6 periods; on-hand=164 + in-transit=79 => pipeline=243 units which covers ~5 periods at ~48.6 units/period. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; keep promised/default lead time. To avoid overstocking from the earlier high-regime, I use a recent_N forecast (last 6 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the current lower-demand regime and reduces holding cost while preserving service over the 4-period lead time.

Historical demand shows a large regime shift back in Jan 2019 (sustained higher demand then) but recent 5 periods (Periods 18-22) show a new, sustained low-demand regime (demands = 7,4,6,5,7; avg\u22485.8). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. No overdue shipments. I set L=default (use promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (N computed from recent regime length=5, capped per rules).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=226, in-transit=0; recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4. Demand has fallen and stabilized at a low level since Period 18. I set L to calculate (confirmed observed lead times average=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new low-demand regime (Periods 18-23) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent stable periods; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent low volatility. This keeps orders small to avoid holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand regime and accounts for the 4-period replenishment delay.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 18: avg demand P13-P17=41.2 units/week vs recent P18-P23=5.67 units/week (\u221286%), sustained for 6 periods

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=221, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 18 (P18-P24 average ~5.67 units/week, sustained 7 periods) after earlier high-demand regime\u2014this is a confirmed sustained drop. Lead time has been observed as 4 in concluded history. To avoid overstocking given low sustained demand and nonzero holding cost, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=7 (the 7-period low-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes a base-stock appropriate to the new lower mean and volatility, reducing orders while maintaining service.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 18 (periods 18\u201325 demand: 7,4,6,5,7,5,5,10 \u2192 recent mean ~6.625 vs prior regime ~41.2). On-hand=211, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals visible. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals). To avoid excess holding cost given sustained low demand, set lead time to promised (default) and forecast using the recent low-demand regime. I select recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the 8-period low-demand regime (balances service level with reduced holding cost).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=187, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 18 (avg ~5.7/week) lasting multiple periods; recent weeks (P23-P26) show small uptick but still well below the early high regime. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods (confirmed in history). I therefore keep L as the promised/default (4). For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the low-demand regime: N=9 (regime length from P18\u2013P26 is 9 periods) so mu_hat uses the mean of the last 9 samples scaled by (1+L). Volatility also uses recent_N N=9 to reflect current low-variance demand. This keeps target base-stock conservative to avoid excess holding given high on-hand inventory and holding cost relative to profit.

======================================================================

Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=135, in-transit=0. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 18 (sustained ~5\u20137/wk) after an earlier high spike; lead time has been observed as 4 periods historically. I choose L=default (use promised 4). For demand I focus on the recent low regime: use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 18\u201327) so mu_hat reflects the current lower mean over the review+lead window and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This keeps ordering conservative to avoid excess holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods in concluded messages; use calculated L to reflect observed history. Demand showed a large drop starting Period 18 and stayed low for many weeks, but the last 3 weeks (Periods 26-28) show a clear rebound (24, 52, 69). To capture the recent uptick I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (focus on last 3 demand observations) so the OR backend targets stock for the new, higher short-run demand while keeping lead-time estimate data-driven.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26: avg P26-P28 = 48.33 units/week vs prior P18-P25 avg \u2248 7.0 (\u2248+590%), sustained 3 periods

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has rebounded since Period 26 (P26-29 demands = 24, 52, 69, 106) indicating a new high-demand regime of length 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=86 (will arrive after promised lead time). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in history; use default lead time. Set demand estimate using recent 4 observations to capture the new regime; set sigma using same recent window to reflect current volatility. This balances higher service level (to avoid stockouts during the regained high-demand regime) against holding cost by relying on a short recent window rather than all historical data.

Recent demand has shifted up starting Period 26; last 5 weeks demands = {24,52,69,106,84}, mean=67.0. To match current high-demand regime and maintain service while accounting for confirmed lead time, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the recent high-demand regime over the review+lead horizon). This increases target base-stock to cover (1+L)\xd7recent mean while sigma reflects recent volatility, balancing higher fill rate against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

On-hand=0, in-transit=325 \u2014 this pipeline covers multiple weeks but arrivals are delayed (observed concluded lead time=4 previously). I set L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (covers Periods 26\u201331, the current high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock and cap to recent elevated mean and volatility, reducing stockout risk while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4. This balances service level in the new high-demand regime against holding cost and accounts for the observed in-transit inventory.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=407. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has shifted up sharply starting Period 29: demands P29-P32 = [106,84,87,68], recent mean \u2248 86.25 over 4 periods. Pipeline (407) covers about 5 periods \u2192 ~81.4/unit per period, close to recent demand. Set L to calculated (use observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (keeps base-stock aligned to recent higher mean while sigma captures recent volatility). This avoids overreacting to older low-demand periods and balances service level (profit $4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand has re-accelerated since Period 29 (demands: P29-33 = 106,84,87,68,149) after prior low regime; on-hand=0 but large in-transit=375 units (covers several weeks). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (use promised/default). To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (covers P29-P33). This raises mu_hat to reflect the current spike while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability. These parameters guide the OR backend to set a higher base stock to avoid stockouts while the large in-transit reduces aggressive topping.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Pipeline is large (on-hand=42, in-transit=406) but lead time confirmations in concluded history consistently show 4 periods. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (consistently 4) so backend uses the empirical lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (5 most recent observed demands) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, so the base-stock reflects the elevated mean and volatility and prevents stockouts while avoiding excessive long-term holding cost given large pipeline.

Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 26 (sustained elevated weekly demand through recent periods), so forecast and volatility should use recent regime samples to capture current mean/variance. Choices: L=calculate to lock in observed lead time=4; mu_hat=recent_N with N=10 to use the last 10 periods of demand (captures the elevated demand regime); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=10 for recent volatility. These parameters ensure the OR backend sets base stock covering (1+L) periods of the current high-demand regime while reflecting recent variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Observed lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded messages; use promised/default L=4. Recent demand (Periods 30-36) shows a new operating regime after prior volatility; I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 7 samples (P30-P36) to capture current mean/volatility while smoothing a single large spike (P33). This balances service (covering (1+L) review+lead demand) against holding costs given large pipeline (284) and on-hand (109).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=95, in-transit=321. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4. Recent demand regime since Period 29 is elevated: demands P29\u2013P37 = [106,84,87,68,149,78,70,64,68], mean=86.0. With promised L=4, I set L to default (use promised). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)*mean_recent = 5*86\u2248430). I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma targets service level vs holding cost tradeoff given profit/holding ratio.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand has returned to a high regime: Periods 33-38 demands = [149,78,70,64,68,90], recent mean \u224886.5 over 6 weeks. Observed lead times from concluded messages are consistently 4 periods. To target service while controlling holding cost, set L based on observed average lead time and use recent-N demand estimates (captures the sustained high-demand regime). Using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the current higher-demand regime and avoids diluting with older low-demand data. No evidence of missing shipments beyond the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent weeks (P33-P39) show substantially higher demand (149,78,70,64,68,90,77; avg \u224888.3) vs the low-demand regime P18-P25. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. To respond to the recent high-demand regime while keeping lead time at the promised value, I use the promised lead time (default) and base demand/volatility estimates on the most recent 7 weeks to capture the current elevated mean and variance. This biases the base-stock toward higher coverage for the current regime and reduces stockout risk while the backend will cap orders per its cap rule.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods (multiple confirmations). On-hand=99, in-transit=324 \u2014 pipeline appears healthy with no new lost shipments. Demand has shown volatility with a recent elevated regime; using recent data best captures current mean/volatility. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). Use recent_N (last 8 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current demand level and dispersion (focus on the most recent regime and avoid diluting with older low-demand periods). These parameters balance service level vs holding cost by sizing base stock to recent demand while allowing the backend cap to limit excessive orders.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent weekly demand has been in the ~60\u201390 range (Periods 36\u201341: 64,68,90,77,59,78; mean \u224872.7) following the higher-demand regime identified earlier (Period 29 onward). On-hand=112 + in-transit=274 provides substantial coverage, but lead-time evidence from concluded messages is consistently 4 periods. To align the OR engine with the confirmed lead time and recent demand regime, I set L to be computed from observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest sustained high-demand weeks. This balances a high service level (profit/holding \u2192 q=0.8) against holding cost by sizing base-stock from recent mean and volatility rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=209. Recent weeks show elevated demand with a large spike in Period 42 (221) and generally higher weekly demand over the last 8 periods (P35\u2013P42 mean \u224890.9). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To capture the recent elevated demand profile (including the large recent spike) while keeping responsiveness to the last two months, I set L to the promised default and use recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes forecast and uncertainty over the review+lead window based on the most relevant recent regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals: e.g., P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P39\u2192P43). Demand has been volatile with recent spikes (notably P42 demand=221) and a clear high-demand regime in late Q3\u2013Q4; to focus the forecast on the most recent regime I use a recent window. I select L='calculate' to reflect the empirically confirmed 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 (captures the last ~8 demand observations to reflect the current demand regime while meeting the min 3 and cap rules). This balances service level during observed high/volatile demand and limits excess holding given current on-hand=84 and in-transit=286. The chosen recent_N will bias the base stock toward recent demand patterns so the OR backend can compute an appropriate order quantity under the promised lead time and volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (multiple arrivals show lead_time=4). On-hand=136, in-transit=384 gives large pipeline cover. Recent demand has been volatile with a large spike (Period 42=221) but overall recent 12-week window shows elevated but mixed demand; to capture the most recent regime while smoothing single-week spikes I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=12. I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history confirms LT=4. Sigma_hat kept as default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to set base_stock responsive to recent demand while relying on confirmed lead time and conservative volatility for service-level vs holding-cost tradeoff.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods in history (consistent arrivals at 4); no evidence of change. Inventory is high (on-hand 153, in-transit 343) versus recent volatile weekly demand (last 6 weeks: 59,78,221,18,14,24). To avoid overreacting to the one large spike (P42=221) I keep L as promised and use an EWMA forecast to give more weight to recent demand while smoothing the spike (gamma=0.3). sigma_hat kept default to reflect long-run demand volatility. These settings aim to maintain service while limiting excess holding given current heavy pipeline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=148, in-transit=343 (pipeline=491) \u2014 ample cover vs. expected demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (many P\u2192P+4 confirms). Recent demand (Periods 43-46) is low and volatile (demands = 18,14,24,5); to capture the latest regime I use a recent-window for demand mean/volatility so the OR engine reduces forward orders given current large pipeline. L set by calculating observed lead times (confirmed=4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 to focus on the most recent low-demand regime and avoid inflating forecasts from earlier high spikes (this reduces excess holding cost while preserving service).
