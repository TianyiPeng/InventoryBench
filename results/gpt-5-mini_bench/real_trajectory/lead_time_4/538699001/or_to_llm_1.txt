  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed actual L=4 (from carry-over). Inventory: on-hand=349, in-transit=0. Recent demand regime: since Period 25 demand fell and has stayed very low (Periods 41-45 weekly demands = 8,4,4,4,2 \u2192 avg \u22484.4/week); this low regime has persisted for many periods, so I treat current single-period mean \u22485 as realistic. OR used promised L and historical higher-demand samples and recommends 264, but that ignores the sustained low-demand regime. With L+1=5 periods, expected demand over lead+review \u22485\xd75=25 units; even allowing safety stock (profit/(profit+holding)=19/20\u2192z\u22481.645) gives a very small replenishment need relative to holdings. Ordering now would create unnecessary holding cost while inventory already covers many weeks of demand (349 units \u224870 weeks at 5/wk). Therefore I place no order this period. I will monitor arrivals/concluded messages for any sign of regime reversal or lost shipments and revise if demand increases or arrivals are observed.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed as 4 periods (already recorded). Inventory: on-hand=348, in-transit=0. Demand evidence: sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (weekly demands mostly in single- to low-double digits; recent 10 periods average \u22486/week), so current on-hand covers >> (L+1) periods of expected demand (348 units / ~6 wk \u2248 58 weeks). OR's cap/base-stock policy uses historical high-demand periods and the promised L, producing a large recommendation (262) driven by a high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1). Given the clear, sustained demand drop and high carrying cost exposure over many future periods, ordering more now would mostly increase holding cost without meaningful sales. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change to warrant replenishment. Final decision: do not order (0 units) to avoid unnecessary holding cost while depleting ample stock; monitor demand for 3+ periods before reversing.",
