Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (5): 292,300,355,391,372. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=4. No 'Period X conclude' messages yet so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. I use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand volatility because no recent changepoint or arrival evidence; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This ensures orders target covering the current plus lead periods while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise given limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand 0, in-transit 415 (ordered in Period 1). Promised lead time is 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Use default demand/lead-time settings: rely on full-sample mean (weeks in Jan\u2013Feb) to set (1+L) demand and default volatility. This keeps the OR engine anchored to historical weekly mean (342) scaled for review+lead and avoids overreacting to a single in-transit shipment that has not concluded.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) average ~342 units/week; current on-hand=0, in-transit=820 (orders from P1/P2). No concluded arrivals yet for those orders, so no reliable evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments. Use promised lead time to let OR backend apply its historical statistics. Choose default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit $4 and holding $1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=1250. No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed; use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 1-3 concludes) shows higher sustained demand vs older samples: last 3 demands = 325, 421, 366 (avg 370.7) vs earlier historical mean ~342. I set L to default (promised=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the recent upward regime: the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 3 samples, increasing order targets to cover the observed higher demand while keeping responsiveness to further changes. This balances service level (profit > holding cost) against holding cost given available pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Periods ending 2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25 show sustained higher demand; last 3-period avg=370.7 vs prior sample avg=342 (+8.4%).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent data show a sustained higher-demand regime (Period 4 carry-over: last 3-period avg=370.7 vs prior avg=342, +8.4%). On-hand=0, in-transit=1700 \u2014 pipeline is sizable but prior orders have not concluded, so I will not assume shorter/longer actual lead-time without concluded arrivals. Set L to default (promised=4) to let backend use contractual lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to target the most recent higher-demand regime (captures the 370.7/week signal across the review+lead window). Keep sigma_hat default (use full-sample volatility) because volatility change is not clearly sustained. These choices bias the base-stock up modestly to protect service during the higher-demand regime while avoiding overreacting to possible lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $860.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=160, in-transit=1504. History shows one concluded arrival: order on Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (observed lead_time=4) so promised lead time remains supported. Recent demand regime (noted in carry-over) shows higher demand in the most recent 3 samples; to capture this shift I use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility. This increases target base-stock to cover the elevated short-term demand while keeping L at promised value so arrivals align with supplier lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = 4 (orders placed P1 and P2 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand 333 + in-transit 1100 = 1433 units provides multi-period coverage. Use calculated L to lock in observed lead time; use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) because historical sample set is limited and earlier carry-over insight noted a temporary regime shift but recent concluded demands are mixed\u2014prefer full-sample stability. These parameters keep the OR backend's base-stock anchored to long-run mean while accounting for confirmed lead time, balancing service-level vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent on-hand=537, in-transit=994. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Recent demand (Periods 5-7) shows a sustained downward regime: demands = [255,232,226], 3-period avg=237.7, well below earlier samples. To avoid excess holdings while maintaining service, I set L to the observed average lead time and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 3 periods (captures the new lower-demand regime). This reduces mu_hat and sigma_hat vs. using older higher samples, lowering target base stock and holding cost exposure while keeping service for current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Periods 5-7 (ending 2019-03-11 to 2019-03-25) show sustained lower demand; avg=237.7 vs prior 3-period avg=370.7 (drop \u224836%), evidence: demands 255,232,226 over 3 consecutive periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent demand has settled into the lower regime observed in Periods 5-8 (demands 255,232,226,228). Concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1-4 all arrived with lead_time=4, so use calculated lead time. To reflect the sustained lower regime I set demand forecast using the most recent 4 samples (regime length=4). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat biases the base-stock toward current lower demand and reduces excess holding while keeping service given pipeline (on-hand 759 + in-transit 544).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-63.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has shifted down: last 5 concluded demands = [255,232,226,228,183] (avg \u2248 225). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple conclude messages: orders on P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). On-hand=795, in-transit=325 gives strong coverage vs. one-period demand but we must size replenishment to the new lower regime. Therefore: set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4); set mu_hat using recent 5-period average to reflect the sustained lower demand; set sigma_hat using recent 5-period std to capture current volatility. These parameters reduce excess safety stock from the prior higher regime while preserving service for the confirmed lower demand pattern and accounting for observed lead-time consistency.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders from P1-P4 arrived in P5-P8). On-hand=690 + in-transit=378 => pipeline covers several periods vs recent lower demand. Demand has shifted down since Period 5 (recent demands P5-P10 = 255,232,226,228,183,106) so I use a recent-window forecast. Choose L=calculate to confirm observed lead time=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (captures periods 5-10) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the recent low-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given tight profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8).

Recent demand has fallen materially since Period 5; using a recent-window forecast to reflect the lower regime and avoid excess holding. Set L=calculate to lock in observed lead time=4. Set mu_hat using recent_N N=7 (covering Periods 5\u201311) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the sustained lower demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=749, in-transit=143 (no overdue shipments visible in concludes). Promised lead time=4 (confirmed historically). I choose L=default to use promised/confirmed 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime (1+L=5 review+lead horizon). This reduces target base stock vs using full-sample mean, limiting holding cost while covering the next 5 periods of weaker demand and preserving service given on-hand + pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 for multiple orders through Period 11. Recent demand has been in a lower regime versus early samples (recent demands: 183,106,90,175,114), so I use a recent-window forecast. L set to calculate to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed 4). mu_hat: recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands). sigma_hat: recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This focuses orders on recent lower demand to reduce holding cost while preserving service given confirmed lead time and some in-transit stock (143) and on-hand 635; avoids over-ordering against outdated higher historical averages.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has settled lower vs early spikes: last 6 demands (Periods 9-14) = [183,106,90,175,114,124], mean=132.0. On-hand=565, in-transit=89; pipeline is ample but demand is lower so reduce forecast window to recent regime. Set L to promised (default=4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture current lower-demand regime (N=6 chosen because a clear regime shift occurred around Period 8 and 6 recent samples available; falls within 3\u201320). This keeps base_stock responsive to the lower recent mean while sigma from recent variability tightens safety stock and reduces excess holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

Promised lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; use default to keep alignment with supplier promise. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures last 5 periods, (1+L) scaling applied by backend). This keeps base-stock responsive to the recent downshift while capping orders via the backend cap to limit holding cost given a high service quantile (q=0.8).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Current on-hand=423, in-transit=185 (pipeline=608). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; demand has been in a lower regime since Period 5 with recent weeks around ~128 units/week. I keep L at the promised/default value (4) consistent with observed confirmations. For demand I use a recent_N approach (N=8) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (last 8 concluded demands: 183,106,90,175,114,124,138,93; mean=127.9) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and reduces bias from earlier high regime. I also use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices make the OR backend size orders to cover the current lower-demand regime for the (L+1) review+lead horizon while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost > 0.

Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; use promised/default to keep OR aligned. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (last 5 demands = 114,124,138,93,86; recent mean \u2248111) so the (1+L) forecast reflects current demand and reduces excess holding versus using the full-sample mean.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent weeks show lower steady demand (~80-140/week) after earlier regime shifts; historical concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4. On-hand=263 + in-transit=283 provides ~546 units (~4\u20136 weeks cover at current demand). To keep OR backend aligned with observed lead time and stable recent demand, use promised/default lead time and let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full sample ( (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std ). This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock given ample pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Recent demand has declined from spring peak; last 5 demands = [138,93,86,74,46] (avg=87.4). Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods and promised is 4, so keep default lead time. To respond to the recent lower-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples (captures current low demand and avoids overstock). Volatility also estimated from the same recent 5 samples (sigma_hat recent_N N=5) to reflect reduced variability and tighter safety stock. This reduces ordering relative to long-run averages while maintaining service given current run-rate and current on-hand + in-transit (295 on-hand, 620 in-transit) which already provide substantial coverage.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=371, in-transit=513 (total pipeline=884). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time. Recent demand shows a sustained downward regime over the last 4 periods (Period 17-20 demands = 86,74,46,31). I set L by averaging observed lead times to capture confirmed LT=4. For demand I use a recent_N regime (N=4) to capture the new low-demand regime (uses last 4 observed demands) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets lower base-stock and avoids excess holding costs while maintaining service. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: last 4-period avg=59.25 (Periods 17-20: 86,74,46,31) vs prior 4-period avg=117.25 (Periods 13-16: 114,124,138,93), drop \u224849.4%; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple observed P->P+4 arrivals).

On-hand=440, in-transit=415 => pipeline large vs. current low demand; I want the OR engine to forecast using the recent low-demand regime to avoid further overstock. Set L by observed average lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 demand samples (captures the sharp drop since Period 17) so the backend orders minimally.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=807, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; no new evidence of change. Demand has been in a sustained lower regime since Period 17 with very low recent weekly sales (periods 17-23: 86,74,46,31,29,33,15); to avoid overstocking I use a recent-window demand estimate. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to base (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent 7 samples reflecting the lower regime. Use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock versus using the full-sample mean, lowering holding costs while preserving service for current low-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=795, in-transit=0; recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 17 (demands: 86,74,46,31,29,33,15,12) so I will base forecast on the recent low-demand regime to avoid excess inventory. Lead time historically confirmed as 4; use promised/default L. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the 8-period low-demand regime and capture recent volatility. This suppresses reorder quantities given high on-hand stock and high holding cost relative to profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=783, in-transit=0; recent demand has settled in a low regime (Periods 20-25 demands = 31,29,33,15,12,12; 6-period avg \u2248 22.0). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To avoid overstock while maintaining service, set L to calculated (uses observed lead times = 4). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the new low-demand regime; use recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat to capture current lower volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock relative to historical highs and prevent excess holding costs given high on-hand inventory and no in-transit shipments.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has collapsed to very low levels (last 4 demands: 15,12,12,13). On-hand=770, in-transit=0; there are no pending arrivals. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To avoid overstock while meeting near-term low demand, keep promised lead time (default) and use recent data for demand forecast and volatility. I select recent_N with N=4 to capture the new low-demand regime so the OR backend will compute a much smaller (1+L)-period demand forecast and lower safety stock, reducing holding cost exposure while preserving service for the current low-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: last 4-period avg=13.0 (Periods 23-26: 15,12,12,13) vs prior 4-period avg=59.25 (Periods 17-20), drop \u224878.0%; Lead time remains confirmed as 4 periods.

Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concludes. To avoid over-ordering given low sustained demand, use promised/confirmed lead time and base forecast on the most recent low-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the 4-period low-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent low volatility.

Recent demand shows a sustained low-demand regime (last 4 demands: Periods 25-28 = 12,13,22,15; 4-period avg=15.5). To avoid overstock given high on-hand and low recent demand, use promised lead time and base forecasts focused on the most recent 4 periods. Set L=default (promised=4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=4 to anchor forecast to current low regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=4 to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders conservative while covering (L+1) periods of expected demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has settled at a low regime since Period 23 (demands: 15,12,12,13,22,15,16). On-hand=717, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4). To capture the sustained low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 7 periods (regime length=7) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the current low-demand sample. This reduces excess ordering vs using all historical higher-demand samples and balances service level vs holding cost given high on-hand stock.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand = 709, in-transit = 0, so current inventory is ample versus low recent demand; to avoid excess holding cost use a low forecast based on the recent low-demand regime. Chosen methods: L kept as default (promised 4) given repeated confirmations; mu_hat set to recent_N using the last 8 periods to capture the new low-demand regime; sigma_hat set recent_N with same N to reflect volatility in this regime. This reduces ordered quantity and balances service vs holding cost.

On-hand=687, in-transit=0 \u2192 ample cover for many periods; no recent arrivals indicate no new in-transit stock. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 but no new evidence to change it. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set L to promised (default=4), forecast demand using a recent-window average to capture the new low-demand regime (use last 5 periods), and estimate volatility from the same recent window. These parameters reduce target base stock to match the current low-demand regime and limit fresh receipts given zero pipeline.

Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To avoid overstock while maintaining service, I keep L as promised (4) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 12 periods (regime length \u224812) to capture the current low-demand regime for both mean and volatility, which reduces forecasted (1+L) demand and tightens safety stock compared to using the full-sample mean.

Chosen L=default to keep backend lead-time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=13 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and reduced volatility, preventing the optimizer from increasing orders despite historical high means.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=659, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. Demand has been in a low, stable regime since the regime shift around Period 27 (sustained low weekly sales ~5\u201316). To avoid overstocking given $1 holding vs $4 profit, set lead time from observed data and forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime (use last 10 periods to capture the current low-demand pattern). This keeps target base-stock conservative while reflecting the recent low variance.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Current on-hand=651, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled at a much lower regime: last 8 periods (P30\u2013P37) demands = [8,10,12,9,9,5,5,8], avg=8.25, substantially below the earlier low-regime avg (~13). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. Because demand shift is sustained (8 consecutive low-demand periods) I use recent_N to focus the forecast on the new regime: set L to default (promised 4), mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent N=8 samples so the OR engine sizes base stock to current low demand and reduces unnecessary holding cost while preserving service. No overdue arrivals to reconcile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37: Periods 30\u201337 avg=8.25 (demands 8,10,12,9,9,5,5,8) vs prior 4-period avg\u224813 (Periods 23\u201326), drop \u224836.5%.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=642, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is ample versus current demand, so keep forecast driven by the recent low-demand regime to avoid excess holding costs. Set L to promised (4). Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime (last 8 samples), reducing order quantity and inventory risk.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has settled at a low regime (Periods 30\u201339 avg \u22488.1 units/week). On-hand is high (636) and in-transit=0; no evidence of lost shipments but arrivals have ceased recently. Promised lead time remains 4 periods; I keep L as default to match supplier promise. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 (captures the last 10 weeks avg \u22488.1 \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u224840.5) and set sigma_hat using recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces future orders versus long-run averages and limits holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 30 (weekly demands mostly 8\u21926). On-hand=630, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for near-term low demand but avoid excess holding. Lead time historically confirmed at 4; use promised lead time. For demand forecast, use a recent-window estimate to capture the low-demand regime (use last 11 samples from the recent low-demand period) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets much lower replenishment and reduces holding cost. This balances service (cover (1+L) periods) against high holding cost given large on-hand stock and a clear low-demand regime. No incoming shipments expected/visible; parameters chosen to avoid new replenishment beyond minimal buffer.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has settled at a low regime since early Sep (Periods 30\u201341: demands 8,10,12,9,9,5,5,8,9,6,6,4; 12-period avg \u2248 7.6). On-hand is high (626) and in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in history. To avoid new replenishment given high on-hand and low recent demand, use promised lead time and a demand estimate based on the last sustained low-demand regime (use recent_N with N=12). Same N for sigma to capture recent volatility. This keeps the OR base-stock low while the cap prevents large orders, minimizing holding cost exposure.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in prior conclues. To avoid overstocking given low recent demand, use recent_N demand estimates focused on the current low-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 30\u201342) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and lower volatility; this balances service vs holding cost given high on-hand and zero pipeline.

On-hand=619, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for the low-demand regime; no recent arrivals. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods historically, so use promised lead time. To align forecasting with the current low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (last 9 periods) so the OR backend targets a much lower review+lead demand and reduces future orders/holding. This balances service (avoid stockouts) with holding-cost reduction given large on-hand stock and minimal pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand has settled at a low level: last 6 periods (P39\u2013P44) demands = 6,6,4,3,4,7 (avg=5.0). On-hand=612, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected. Historical conclude messages confirm lead time=4 in prior periods. To avoid excess holding cost versus small demand, I use the confirmed promised lead time and base demand estimates on the most recent 6 periods to capture the new low-demand regime. Methods: L=default (use promised 4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean and keep orders aligned to current low demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent low volatility. This reduces over-ordering given large on-hand and zero pipeline while allowing the backend capped policy to limit order size.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 44: last 6-period avg=5.0 (Periods 39-44: 6,6,4,3,4,7) vs prior Periods 30-37 avg\u22488.25 (drop \u224839.4%).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent demand is very low and stable (Periods 39-45 avg \u22485; recent 6-period avg=5.0 per carry-over). On-hand=609, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover, no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 in history and promised lead time is 4. To align supply with the current low-demand regime we use recent demand estimates: set L to default (promised 4), mu_hat from the most recent 6 periods to capture the current low regime, and sigma_hat from the most recent 6 periods to reflect reduced volatility. This reduces ordering compared to long-run averages and limits holding cost given very high on-hand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=607, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been very low and stable (Periods 39-46 weekly demands: 6,6,4,3,4,7,3,2 \u2192 recent 8-period average \u22484.625; prior carry-over insight noted a 6-period avg=5). Promised lead time is 4 and multiple concluded arrivals confirm LT=4 historically; use default for L to keep alignment with promise. To avoid overstocking given large on-hand and sustained low demand, forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should use the recent regime. I choose recent_N=6 to capture the low-demand regime while obeying the recent_N rules (N between 3 and 20). These parameters reduce target base-stock and cap orders, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for observed low demand.
