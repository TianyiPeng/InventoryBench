Current on-hand=80; in-transit=840 comprised of orders from P43 (400 arr during this period), P44 (100 arr P48), P45 (120 arr P49), P46 (220 arr P50). When choosing order now, those in-transit units must be counted since they will arrive within the lead-time horizon. Recent demand (P43-P46 = 91,156,158,80) average \u2248121; earlier regime spike observed but recent two periods show mixed/declining demand. Required coverage for L+1=5 periods using a conservative forecast (~150/unit) would be ~750 units; current coverage (80+840=920) already exceeds this. Placing additional units would increase holding cost while providing little incremental sales probability. Order 0 to avoid excess inventory and holding cost.",
