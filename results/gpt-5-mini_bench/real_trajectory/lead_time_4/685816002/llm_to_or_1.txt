Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean 66.2 and moderate variability; no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. Promised lead time=4 periods will be used and demand forecast set to default aggregated (1+L)\xd7mean to let the OR engine compute base stock; default sigma uses all samples. This balances service (covering current + L future weeks) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=81 from Period 1 order which has not concluded yet (single missed arrival; insufficient evidence to change lead time). Historical weekly mean demand = 66.2 units; with promised L=4, default (1+L) demand coverage = 5\xd7mean \u2248 331 units. Holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so use default base-stock sizing to prioritize service while relying on OR backend caps. No strong changepoint detected from one missed arrival, so keep defaults for L, mu_hat, sigma_hat.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows no arrivals for orders placed in P1 and P2; insufficient (only 2 periods) evidence to infer a lead-time change or lost shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=177; historical weekly mean demand = 66.2 (samples: 76,64,73,53,65) so pipeline (~2.7 weeks of demand) is well below (1+L)=5 review+lead periods, so we should use the promised lead time and baseline demand estimates to prompt replenishment. Therefore: use default L (promised 4), default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These settings let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances service (profit/Holding cost ratio) vs holding cost while we gather more arrival evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=282 which equals sum of prior orders (81+96+105). No 'arrived' confirmations in any concluded periods, so we have no confirmed change to actual lead time; shipments appear in-transit but not yet concluded. Demand historical mean ~66.2/week (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). Using promised lead time (default) keeps the OR engine aligned with contract L=4 and lets it compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma using full-sample stats; this balances service level given profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overreacting to unconfirmed delivery issues. No explicit adjustment to mu or sigma because no sustained demand regime change is observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Historical weekly pre-period samples (Jan) mean=66.2; recent realized demand (Periods 1-4) = [96,102,119,82], recent mean=99.75 (+50% vs historical) indicating a sustained upward demand regime over 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=400 which equals sum of orders from P1-P4 (81+96+105+118=400); those orders will begin arriving according to promised lead time (default L=4) so the first of these may arrive during this current period but will only be observed in a future conclude. I set L to default (promised 4) because no concluded arrivals exist yet to infer a different actual lead time. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (N=4 is >=3 and equals the length of the recent regime). This raises the target base stock to cover (1+L) periods at the new mean while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility in the same window, balancing higher service level needs against holding cost (holding cost is low relative to profit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: recent avg (P1-P4)=99.75 vs historical Jan mean=66.2 (+50%); sustained for 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1219.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=16, in-transit=444. Historical Jan samples mean=66.2, but recent demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 1 (P1-P4 avg=99.75, +50% vs Jan) \u2014 use recent data. Period 5 conclude confirms an observed lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5), so set L based on observed history. To capture the higher recent demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (N=4 periods, P1-P4). This provides (1+L)-period demand driven by the shifted mean while sigma is estimated from the same recent window; this balances higher service level needs against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand regime: Periods 1-4 showed elevated weekly demand (~96,102,119,82 \u2192 recent avg \u224899.8) vs historical Jan mean ~66.2 (\u2248+50%) and this uplift persisted through obs window. Observed arrivals confirm actual lead times = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6). On-hand 56 + in-transit 435 = 491 units, which covers multiple weeks at the higher demand level. Decisions: set L by calculating observed lead time to reflect confirmed 4-period actual. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to anchor forecast to the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 demand samples). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices align the base-stock target to the sustained higher demand while using recent volatility to avoid under- or over-stocking given confirmed lead time and large pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Concluded arrivals show orders placed P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7 (lead_time=4 consistently). On-hand=99, in-transit=344; promised lead time=4. Demand history: recent four concluded demands (P4-P7)=82,65,56,62 (mean\u224866.25) which is lower than the early-period spike. To reflect confirmed LT=4 I let backend compute L by observed average ('calculate'). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to focus the forecast on the latest regime and avoid overweighting the early spike; same recent_N (N=4) for sigma to capture current volatility. These parameters balance service (use recent demand mean over the review+lead window) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2->P6, P3->P7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (carry-over: P1-P4 recent avg=99.75 vs historical Jan mean=66.2, sustained 4 periods). On-hand=89, in-transit=226 -> healthy pipeline but demand elevated; lead time observations (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8) confirm L\u22484. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to base mu_hat on the verified higher recent regime (captures the +50% uplift). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts under the new higher demand) while the OR backend will still cap orders to limit excessive holding given holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-9) averages ~90 units/week; confirmed lead time = promised 4 periods (observed P1->P5,P2->P6,P3->P7). Current on-hand 114 + in-transit 235 = 349 units (covers multiple weeks of demand). No evidence of lost shipments. To let the OR backend compute safety stock with the established lead time and full historical sample statistics, I choose default methods so mu_hat and sigma_hat use all available demand samples (captures the sustained higher recent demand) and L uses the promised lead time (confirmed by arrivals). This balances high service level (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95) against holding cost given already-large pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=111, in-transit=269; no overdue arrivals visible in concludes. Historical concluded lead-times are all 4 \u2192 confirmed. Demand has been persistently above historical Jan mean across recent periods (recent 10-period regime shows elevated mean), so forecast should use recent data to capture the higher demand and its variability. Set L via observed lead-times (calculate). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility; this balances service (capture uplift) against holding cost by informing the OR backend with empirically-updated mean and std.

On-hand=0, in-transit=385 (sufficient pipeline but demand remains elevated). Lead time empirically confirmed as 4 in multiple conclude messages; I use observed-average for L. To capture the new demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 samples (P5\u2013P11) so the OR backend builds a base-stock sized for the higher mean and higher variance, balancing the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost and avoiding stockouts given long lead time and proven demand shift.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=542. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has picked up recently (last 4 periods demand = [100,90,158,129], higher than earlier means), so I base demand forecast on the most recent 4 weeks to capture the upward shift. Set L to default (promised 4) to reflect confirmed lead time. Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=4) so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 periods, raising target stock to preserve service given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1). Set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility and avoid under-ordering while in-transit stock is large but demand remains elevated.

On-hand=44, in-transit=576 (sufficient pipeline but demand regime remains higher). Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods historically, so use promised/default LT. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods to capture the new higher mean and increased volatility (so base stock and safety stock reflect current regime and reduce stockouts while acknowledging holding cost).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has been elevated vs Jan baseline (sustained +50% noted earlier); recent weeks show weekly demand mostly ~90\u2013133. On-hand=32, in-transit=511 (pipeline ample vs expected demand over lead+review). Lead-time observed consistently =4 in concluded history; use calculated lead time to reflect confirmed observations. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the post-shift regime (captures Weeks P7\u2013P14 demand pattern) so the OR engine sizes base stock to service elevated demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1/unit. This balances service level (higher mean) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been elevated vs. Jan historical samples (sustained higher regime); last 5 observed weekly demands = [158,129,90,133,148], recent mean \u2248131.6. On-hand=14, in-transit=509 (pipeline\u2248523) which already covers multiple weeks at current demand. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes; therefore use promised/default L. To capture the elevated recent demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand observations (recent_N N=5). This focuses the forecast on the current higher-demand regime while the default L keeps the OR engine aligned with contracted lead time; using recent_N for sigma preserves observed volatility. Parameters aim to maintain high service (profit/holding gives q\u22480.95) but avoid over-ordering given large in-transit inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent realized demand has been materially higher than the historical Jan samples (recent mean \u2248111 units/week over last 12 concluded periods). Promised lead time is 4 and recent concludes consistently show 4-period arrivals. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 527 which should cover multiple weeks. I set L to default (use promised lead time=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=12) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime observed over the last 12 concluded periods. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock that properly scales to the elevated recent demand while using observed lead-time reliability.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=10, in-transit=534. Historical Jan samples mean=66.2 but carry-over shows a sustained +50% higher demand regime starting Period 1 (recent avg P1-P4=99.75). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To reflect the sustained higher demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the detected regime (N=4) so the OR backend increases target base-stock to cover the higher demand; keep L=default (promised 4) since concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. This balances higher service-level needs (capture extra demand) while relying on observed LT to avoid over-ordering.

Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent 5-week elevated demand (periods 14-18 avg \u2248 146 per week \u2192 (1+L)\xd7mean reflected by backend). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=14, in-transit=686. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; demand has been above historical Jan baseline for many periods (recent weeks averaging well above 90). To reflect the sustained higher demand profile while relying on confirmed lead time, use promised lead time (default) and center forecast on recent observations. I select recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime and volatility (reduces influence of older low-Jan samples) so the OR engine raises base-stock to meet higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (consistent across multiple periods). Recent demand has been high: last 5 demands (Periods 16-20) = [175,158,117,114,179], indicating a sustained elevated regime vs. early-year samples. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 4. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent regime, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given large recent demand) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 1 (sustained higher weekly sales vs Jan baseline); to capture recent elevated mean/volatility I use recent-window estimates. L: use calculated average of observed lead times (observed concludes all = 4). mu_hat & sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability, so the OR backend sets base-stock to service the higher level while capping orders to limit excess holdings. This balances the high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by targeting higher service with controlled cap.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=164, in-transit=500. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4. Demand has been elevated vs Jan baseline; to reflect the recent higher regime I use recent_N for demand parameters to weight recent weeks rather than long-run Jan samples. L uses promised/default (4) since concluded messages consistently show 4. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=8) to capture the recent demand regime (last 8 demand observations) so the OR engine will size base-stock for the (1+L) review+lead window while keeping variability estimate responsive to current volatility. This balances higher service tendency (profit >> holding cost) with holding-cost sensitivity given substantial pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=126, in-transit=589. Historical Jan mean=66.2 but recent operations show consistently higher weekly demand (~100\u2013180). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in previous concludes. To capture current elevated demand regime while using the backend's lead-time assumption, I set L to default (promised 4). I ask the backend to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent N=20 demand samples to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility; this balances higher service needs against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Historical Jan mean=66.2 but carry-over shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 1 (recent avg P1-P4=99.75) and lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand=280, in-transit=301 (pipeline adequate but demand higher than historical). I keep L at the promised/confirmed value to match observed arrivals. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the post-shift higher demand regime (use last 20 periods to reflect sustained higher demand and reduce influence of early low-sample Jan data). Similarly use recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility. These parameters prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given profit >> holding cost ($19 vs $1) while sigma_hat recent_N captures true variability for safety stock.

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 1 (carry-over: recent avg P1-P4=99.75 vs Jan mean=66.2, sustained). To keep service while controlling holding cost: use promised/default lead time, and base mu/sigma on the most recent sustained regime.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 1 (sustained elevated weekly sales ~100+), so I bias forecasts to recent data rather than Jan historical samples. Set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and variance over a sizable recent window, improving service while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. Demand has been elevated vs historical Jan samples (sustained higher sales through recent periods); lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. Current on-hand=262 and in-transit=361 (total pipeline+on-hand=623) which appears ample vs recent demand but we keep safety by scaling forecast from the most recent regime. Set L to promised (default=4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing shorter noise. No evidence of lost shipments currently (arrivals have consistently matched 4-period lead time). These choices increase target base-stock to meet higher service needs while sigma_hat based on recent data controls safety-stock sizing to limit excess holding cost.

On-hand=168, in-transit=456 (no overdue arrivals visible in conclude messages). Promised lead time is 4 and prior concludes confirm actual lead time=4, so use default promised L. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N on the most recent regime samples (long recent window) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and avoids understocking. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over confirms lead time = 4 and a sustained demand uplift earlier, but recent concluded demands (Periods 29-32: 96,94,79,59) are mixed; no new sustained changepoint detected. Promised lead time=4 is consistent with observed arrivals \u2014 use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (anchors to historical Jan mean 66.2 \u2192 (1+4)*66.2=331 demand across review+lead).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Current on-hand 274 + in-transit 249 = 523 units in pipeline. To reflect the sustained higher demand, I use a recent-window demand estimate to raise the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast while keeping L = promised (default) since confirmed historical arrivals align with 4. I also use a recent-window volatility estimate to capture current variance for safety stock. Methods chosen: L=default to use promised lead time (4); mu_hat=recent_N to bias forecast toward recent higher-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N to reflect recent volatility.

Recent demands have been persistently higher (~100+ per week) compared to early Jan samples; I use a recent-window estimate to capture the current higher demand regime. Choose L=default to respect promised lead time (confirmed historically). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, which raises target base-stock to maintain service under the sustained higher demand while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding costs.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=272, in-transit=321. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained higher-demand regime (~100/wk vs historical Jan mean ~66). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time and emphasize recent demand in the forecast. L uses default (promised=4). mu_hat uses recent_N to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; choose N=20 to average the most recent periods and smooth variability. sigma_hat uses default to let backend scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices align base-stock toward the current ~100/week demand while respecting holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=298, in-transit=336. Historical Jan samples mean=66.2 but a sustained higher-demand regime was previously detected (carry-over). No overdue/lost shipments visible; observed lead times in history consistently 4. To reflect the sustained higher demand, use recent demand statistics rather than historical Jan baseline. Keep L as promised (default=4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility over the last 20 demand observations so the OR engine increases target base stock to meet elevated demand while the sigma estimate supports adequate safety stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has been in the higher regime noted previously (\u2248+50% vs Jan baseline) and lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods; current on-hand=247, in-transit=336 (pipeline=583). I keep L at the promised/default (4) since lead time is confirmed and stable. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the most recent 20 samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean forecast). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock aligned to the sustained elevated demand while sigma from recent data balances service level vs holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=350, in-transit=186. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time=4 (consistent with promised); inventory coverage is ample vs. recent demand. I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. Demand has shown a sustained higher regime vs. early-Jan baseline; to focus the forecast on the most relevant recent behavior I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=20 (captures the latest ~20 weeks of demand). Sigma_hat uses default to scale variability over (1+L) periods. These choices bias the base stock toward servicing higher recent demand while keeping volatility measured over full history to avoid overreacting to short noise; with Profit=$19 and Holding=$1 the backend will target a high service quantile (q\u22480.95) but my parameters constrain orders via the cap.

Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=378, in-transit=158. Historical concluces confirm actual lead time=4. Demand has shown a sustained upward regime vs. Jan baseline; to capture recent demand while smoothing noise I set L to promised (default) and mu_hat to recent_N (N=20) to reflect the recent higher-demand regime. sigma_hat left as default to use overall observed variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service level (due to stronger recent demand) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 and no new sustained demand shift: latest 5 demands average ~57, and current inventory (on-hand 349 + in-transit 207 = 556) is ample versus typical demand. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with supplier promise; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise and leverages confirmed lead-time evidence while minimizing holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=163, in-transit=237; pipeline+on-hand (400) comfortably covers expected demand given historical patterns. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; continue using promised/default L to keep alignment with supplier promise. Historical carry-over indicated a sustained demand uplift earlier; to keep the forecast responsive to recent dynamics while smoothing noise, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent regime without overfitting to a single large spike in Period 42). sigma_hat kept as default to let backend scale variability over the full history. These choices bias orders toward maintaining service (higher mu_hat from recent data) while default sigma avoids overreacting to one-off variance, balancing profit vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). SKU 685816002: on-hand=162, in-transit=323. Promised lead time=4 and historical concludes consistently confirm LT=4. Profit $19 / holding $1 => high service target (q\u22480.95). Pipeline + on-hand (485 units) currently covers multiple weeks of demand; no recent sustained demand or LT changepoints beyond previously recorded. I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history, preserving the high service level while avoiding manual over-adjustment given no new sustained signal.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=132, in-transit=415. Historical Jan samples show mean\u224866.2, but a sustained higher-demand regime was recorded from Period 1 (recent avg \u224899.75 lasting many periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To respect the sustained higher-demand regime while using many recent observations, I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the prolonged higher-demand regime (uses last 20 demand samples for (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices increase target base-stock to reduce stockouts under elevated demand while the large in-transit quantity and capped order policy will limit excessive new orders.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (week before Christmas). Historical carry-over shows a sustained demand regime uplift (+50% since Period 1) and lead time confirmed at 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=101, in-transit=350 (pipeline_total=451) \u2014 ample coverage for multiple weeks. I keep L = promised (default) since confirmed historically and aligns with observations. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability around the holiday, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent 5 demand observations rather than diluted full-history averages. This raises target base stock to maintain service during the holiday spike while avoiding excessive long-term holding costs given current large pipeline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=94, in-transit=503; promised lead time=4 and historical concludes confirm LT=4. Profit/holding implies a very high service quantile (q\u22480.95) so we prioritize service. Recent demand is volatile; use recent data to capture current regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the latest 5 demand observations, which helps the backend compute a base stock that reflects current demand while avoiding overweighting stale early-year samples. This balances high service (few stockouts) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.
