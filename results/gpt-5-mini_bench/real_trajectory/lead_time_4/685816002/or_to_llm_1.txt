{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed L=4 (carry-over insight). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=541 (these in-transit units will arrive across upcoming periods given L=4 confirmations). Recent demand: last 4 observed weekly demands = 64, 80, 104, 58 (avg \u224876); earlier sustained higher regime (Periods 7\u201311) already recorded in carry-over insights. OR recommendation 78 is computed using promised L and demand stats, but it ignores current large pipeline. Risk/benefit: profit $19/unit >> holding $1/unit, but ordering now creates excess ending inventory and unnecessary holding cost because pipeline (541) already covers approximately (L+1)*avg_demand \u22485*76=380 units; 541 > 380 by \u2248161 units. Therefore do not place additional order this period and avoid increasing holding costs or exacerbating overstock. Action: order 0 units for SKU 685816002.",
