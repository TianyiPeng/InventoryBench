Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (weeks ending 2019-01-07..2019-02-04): [1,6,7,3,15]. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=4. No concluded arrivals observed yet so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. The last-week spike (15) is a single-period event without 3+ sustained periods, so I remain conservative. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine uses all samples for mean/std over (1+L) periods, balancing service level vs holding cost without overreacting to a single spike.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent concluded history: Period1 demand=57 (spike) but previous historical samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show low weekly demand [1,6,7,3,15]; single high week is not a sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=16 (order placed P1 arrived=0 in conclude \u2192 cannot infer lead time change yet). Use promised lead time (default) because no confirmed lead-time observations. Use default demand estimates (all-samples) since no sustained changepoint: this gives mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which balances service level with holding cost given uncertain spike that is not yet confirmed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=66 (orders placed P1=16, P2=50). Promised lead time is 4 periods and neither order has concluded yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 and 2 concludes) \u2014 this is within the promised window, so no confirmed lead-time change. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean ~6.4 units/week; with review+lead horizon (1+L) the default aggregations are appropriate. To avoid overreacting to two zero-arrival concludes (still within lead time) use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean and std. This balances service level (covers expected demand over 1+L periods) while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $4.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent weekly demands (historic samples) average ~6.4 units/week; no arrivals have been concluded yet for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (arrived=0), but promised lead time is 4 and we remain within the expected window so no lead-time change is confirmed. On-hand=0, in-transit=137 (sum of prior orders). Use default lead time (promised L=4) because there is no concluded evidence of a different actual lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level given modest historical demand and the known profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Historical weekly demand samples: [1,6,7,3,15], mean=6.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=199. Orders from Periods 1-4 have not concluded yet (arrived=0 in recent concludes); this is not sufficient to confirm a lead-time change given promised L=4 (orders placed in Period 1 would only conclude in Period 5). I therefore keep L at default (promised) to let the OR engine use the contract lead time. Demand forecast uses default aggregation (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to capture the multi-period demand horizon while remaining conservative given limited data (mu_hat default). Volatility is left to the engine's default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because the sample set is small and there is no confirmed regime shift. These choices balance service level (using full (1+L) horizon) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory (199 units) that will reduce net orders placed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized weekly demand has been high and rising (Periods 1-5 demands: 57,72,64,92,112). On-hand=0, in-transit=228 (sufficient pipeline for several periods). Observed arrivals show lead time = 4 (order in P1 arrived in P5), matching promised L=4. Use default L to keep promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated demand regime from the last five periods so the OR backend sizes base-stock to meet higher demand and appropriately scale safety stock for volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given rising demand) against holding cost since substantial pipeline exists.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, lead_time=4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has stepped up sharply (last 3 concluded period demands = 92, 112, 184) versus earlier low-volume historical samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=295 (several prior orders still in pipeline). Lead-time observed consistently as 4 periods in concluded history; use calculated lead time. To capture the new higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the elevated recent mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given demand surge) against holding cost by relying on a short recent window rather than long-run low historical means.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=433. Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7), so actual lead time confirmed. Demand has shifted up vs. the 2019 samples: recent period demands = [57,72,64,92,112,184,169] (mean \u2248107.1). To cover review+lead (1+L) periods I use recent data to capture the higher regime. Therefore: L set by calculating observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=7 to reflect the current high-demand regime and its volatility, so the OR engine will size base stock for higher demand while respecting holding cost tradeoff. In-transit=433 will be reconciled by the engine versus pipeline when computing order quantity.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent concluded demand (Periods 5-8 = 112,184,169,209) shows a sustained, higher-demand regime vs. the small-sample prior. Lead time has been observed as 4 periods (confirmed earlier). I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high mean demand over the last 4 periods ((avg demand \u2248168.5) scaled by (1+L)=5), and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to reduce stockouts under the new demand regime while keeping volatility estimation tied to recent variation.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history shows consistent arrivals 4 periods after ordering (confirmed LT=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=755 \u2014 substantial pipeline that will cover multiple future demands. Historical weekly demand samples (1,6,7,3,15) give baseline mean=6.4. I choose L by calculation (use observed lead times) to reflect confirmed 4-period actual LT; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set, keeping orders aligned with long-run demand while the large in-transit volume reduces need for aggressive replenishment. This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost given heavy pipeline and confirmed LT.

Demand history small-sample mean ~6.4/wk; given confirmed lead time=4 I use default calculations so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps L at the promised/observed 4, producing a base-stock sized to cover the (L+1)-period demand while the large in-transit pipeline prevents aggressive additional ordering and limits holding cost exposure.

Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=122, in-transit=429 (total pipeline=551). Historical concluded lead times repeatedly =4 periods; no new lead-time evidence so use promised/default L. Demand history is sparse and shows no recent sustained regime shift (samples: 1,6,7,3,15), so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility. With large pipeline relative to expected (1+L) demand, defaults avoid creating extra orders and let capped policy limit replenishment to prevent excess holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=217, in-transit=237. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 (confirmed at Period 6 and repeatedly thereafter), so set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect that confirmation. Demand exhibits a clear, sustained upward regime versus the small-sample Jan data (recent 12 periods show consistently high weekly demand: 57,72,64,92,112,184,169,209,140,110,94,97). To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect current mean and volatility over the sustained high-demand period. This ensures sufficient orders to meet elevated demand while the OR backend's cap limits excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple P conclude lines). On-hand=368, in-transit=198 (pipeline substantial). Historical early samples are small, but recent realized weekly demand (Periods 5\u201313) shows a higher, stable regime (112,184,169,209,140,110,94,97,86). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the observed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the new higher-demand regime across the last 9 concluded periods (Periods 5\u201313) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to capture recent volatility. These choices steer the OR engine toward provisioning for the sustained higher demand while the large pipeline reduces urgent ordering, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Pipeline + on-hand currently large relative to recent demands, so use lead-time estimate based on observed lead times and default demand stats to let OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding manual overcorrection. Chosen L: calculate to lock in observed lead time=4; mu_hat: default to let backend use (1+L)*mean(all samples); sigma_hat: default to use sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): recent demand is materially higher than the small 2019-Jan seed samples (sustained 6+ periods of 80\u2013184 weekly demand). On-hand=131 + in-transit=383 = 514 units which must cover (1+L) periods. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods, so use calculated lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime, use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 demand observations; this biases the (1+L) forecast and volatility toward current demand and avoids understock from relying on old low samples. These parameters balance service level (reduce lost sales) against holding cost by reflecting the confirmed higher demand and measured variability.

Demand has risen recently (last 5 concluded demands: 97,86,100,137,151). To capture the confirmed LT and recent higher demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=103, in-transit=368. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (e.g., P5 arrival from P1, P6 from P2, etc.), so use observed lead time. I select L by 'calculate' (average of observed lead times = 4). Demand priors are sparse (initial sample mean 6.4/wk) and no sustained demand regime change since arrivals match promised cadence, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These choices give the OR engine a base-stock covering the review+lead horizon while keeping safety stock driven by historical variability; using observed L ensures orders are sized to cover the correct replenishment delay.

Demand history is limited in the sample set; with high profit ($4) vs holding ($1) we should favor service. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses all samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively, giving a conservative base-stock anchored to the full historical sample set and the inferred lead time.

Set L to calculated average of observed lead times (will be 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (use the last 20 observed demand samples) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and its volatility from the current high-demand regime, matching service-level (q=0.8) while accounting for holding cost risk and large in-transit pipeline.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; use promised/default L to align with observed. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime, use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures last 5 demand observations) so the OR backend reduces target stock while still respecting variability and the long pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (sustained). On-hand=268, in-transit=307 (healthy pipeline). Recent realized weekly demand has been ~38\u2013184 with a stable regime over many periods. I keep L as promised (default=4) because concludes consistently show 4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to ground the (1+L) forecast and volatility in the most recent demand regime (captures the last ~10 weeks of demand behavior and avoids overweighting the sparse Jan samples). This balances service (avoid stockouts given current pipeline) with holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than the small, older sample set.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent realized weekly demand (last 8 concluded weeks Periods 20\u201327) averages ~82.1 units/week, a sustained regime much higher than the sparse Jan samples. On-hand=308, in-transit=155 => pipeline covers several weeks but demand remains ~82/wk. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in prior concludes; use promised/default L=4. Set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)\xd7recent mean = 5\xd782.125 = 410.625 to reflect current high-demand regime. Estimate sigma_hat explicitly from recent-week sample std: std \u224819.73, scaled by sqrt(1+L) gives \u224844.13. These explicit choices steer the OR engine to a higher base-stock matching recent demand while the sigma captures observed volatility, balancing service level against the $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent on-hand=293, in-transit=112; previous conclude history consistently shows actual lead time=4 (confirmed). Current inventory is high vs recent weekly demands, so keep promised lead time and population-wide demand estimates. Set L to default (use promised 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all historical samples \u2014 conservative, stable estimates given no sustained demand regime change. This avoids over-ordering despite ample on-hand and in-transit stock and accounts for holding cost vs profit balance.

On-hand=271 + in-transit=228 => pipeline covers multiple weeks, so no aggressive uplift needed. I choose L=calculate to lock in the observed lead time average (4). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to short-term noise.

I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend applies the standard base-stock calculation: L set to default (use promised lead time = 4), mu_hat default to capture (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, and sigma_hat default to capture sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps safety stock calibrated to historical variability while avoiding unnecessary explicit over-forecasting given large current pipeline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=256, in-transit=233 => pipeline inventory=489, which comfortably covers several weeks of demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple P conclude messages). I choose to let the backend compute average observed lead time (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time. For demand I use default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default sigma (all-sample std scaled) because available seeded demand samples are limited and recent demand shows variability but no sustained regime shift requiring override. These settings keep the OR engine anchored to observed statistics while acknowledging confirmed lead time and avoiding unnecessary extra stock given already-large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed repeatedly: orders placed Pn arrived Pn+4).

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Concluded history consistently confirms actual lead time = 4 periods.

Given confirmed LT=4 and no recent demand regime shift, use default statistical aggregation so the OR backend computes base_stock consistent with long-run samples while honoring high service level implied by profit/holding. This minimizes stockouts without unnecessary extra explicit adjustments despite high on-hand inventory.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent realized demand is much higher than the tiny sample set in the seeding data; last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 32-36) average ~62 units. On-hand=218 + in-transit=235 = 453 units, which currently covers ~7.3 weeks at the recent demand rate (453 / 62 \u2248 7.3), so we can be conservative on new receipts. Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default L. To align the OR engine with the recent higher demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 demand observations (recent_N, N=5). This raises the base-stock target to protect service while the pipeline is healthy; sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. No evidence of a new sustained lead-time or demand regime change beyond what recent data shows.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=184, in-transit=207. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many Pn\u2192Pn+4 arrivals). Recent weekly demand has been moderate (many weeks in range ~35\u201375); no sustained demand regime shift detected from history. Promised lead time (4) is supported by evidence, so use default lead time. Use default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this balances service level given high profit-to-holding ratio (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding manual under/over-adjustment given stable demand history and substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Historical concluded lead times repeatedly confirm L=4. Current inventory: on-hand=196, in-transit=251 (healthy pipeline). Recent demand history (weeks shown) is stable without sustained regime shifts. Use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimates so OR backend applies full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps policy aligned with observed consistent lead time and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while letting backend cap orders by its safety-cap rule.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent concluded history shows stable actual lead time = 4 and steady weekly demand ~35\u201375 (recent mean \u224859.3 over last 8 weeks). On-hand=225 and in-transit=234 (healthy pipeline). Use promised lead time (default) since concluded arrivals confirm L=4 and no lost shipments. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the latest regime (8-week window mean \u224859.3); (1+L) multiplier will be applied by backend. This keeps service level responsive to recent demand while avoiding excess holding given Holding=$1 vs Profit=$4 (q=0.8 favors higher fill but we limit to recent data).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=240, in-transit=170. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods, so use promised lead time (default). Recent realized demand (many periods with tens\u2013low hundreds sold) is far above the small seed samples from Jan; to capture the current demand regime I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the latest 20 samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given substantial pipeline) against holding cost by basing base-stock on recent demand/variability rather than the tiny original sample set.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent weekly demand has been ~40\u201375 with last observed demand=42 and several weeks near 49\u201360; current on-hand=198 + in-transit=170 => pipeline=368, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at recent demand. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead time=4. No evidence of lost shipments. To avoid over-ordering given high pipeline and non-spiking seasonal signals, use the promised/default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend applies its capped ordering rule using full-sample statistics.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Demand history shows stable weekly sales recently and concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4 periods. Current available inventory = on-hand 170 + in-transit 175 = 345 units, which provides coverage vs. multi-period demand (no large imminent seasonality indicated). I select default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend uses the promised L and full-sample mean/std to compute base-stock; this is appropriate because concluded history is long and stable (no new sustained changepoint) and avoids overfitting to short-term noise. Using defaults keeps ordering conservative given holding cost >0 and confirmed reliable 4-period arrivals.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=171, in-transit=271. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple confirmations). Current pipeline + on-hand (442 units) is large relative to recent weekly demand (typically 40\u2013150/week), so avoid increasing forecast or volatility artificially. Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps ordering conservative given high pipeline and prevents excess holding cost while preserving service level.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

No new evidence of lost shipments or demand regime shift; recent weekly demands in history average moderate levels. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time to let the OR engine compute review+lead demand and safety stock from full-sample statistics. Using default L, mu_hat, sigma_hat delegates mean and volatility estimation to the backend so base_stock and cap reflect all historical data and the known profit/holding tradeoff (q=0.8) while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise. This keeps orders sized to cover the (1+L) demand window given the large existing pipeline and avoids unnecessary explicit increases that would raise holding cost.
