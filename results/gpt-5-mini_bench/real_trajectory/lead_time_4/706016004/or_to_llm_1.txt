OR computed \u03bc\u0302=(1+L)\u03bc\u0304=32 over the next 5 periods and (with cap) recommended 16. Reality check: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=4 (so we must cover 5 periods of demand). The most recent observation (15 units one week) is a strong upward signal versus the long-run mean but is only one period of evidence. Given no pipeline and long lead time, following OR's capped recommendation (16) would likely lead to stockouts if the recent higher demand persists because expected demand over 5 periods is ~32. Cost tradeoff: profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high critical fractile (q=0.8) so carrying more stock is justified to avoid lost sales. I therefore order to cover the OR's estimated 5-period demand (\u03bc\u0302\u224832) so pipeline+on-hand will approximately equal expected demand over lead+review. This increases safety against the recent spike while accepting some extra holding cost if the spike is transient.

OR recommends 50 using promised L=4 and historical demand only. Lead-time/in-transit note: the P1 order remains in-transit (no arrival concluded); it may be delayed or lost, so do not assume those 32 will reliably arrive on time. Demand assessment: one period with demand=57 is a strong signal of a possible regime shift but is not yet sustained (need \u22653 periods to confirm). Risk trade-offs: stockout risk is high if demand near 57 repeats and the in-transit 32 does not arrive; holding cost is modest ($1/unit/period) vs profit $4/unit (critical fractile high). Decision logic: raise order above OR to cover heightened near-term demand and potential lost/delayed pipeline, but avoid fully assuming the 57/week level as permanent. Quantitatively: OR\u2019s capped policy likely underestimates near-term need given the 57 spike and zero on-hand. Action chosen = 80 units: this boosts available supply (~in-transit 32 + new 80 = 112 units eventually) to reduce immediate stockout risk while limiting overstock if the spike is transient.
