Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand shows a clear upward regime since 2019-01-21 (samples: 48,72,90). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead periods. I set L=default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (weeks 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the new higher demand while keeping variability grounded in the most recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: prior mean (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14)=8.5; recent mean (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04)=70 (+723%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent weekly samples: 48,72,90; recent mean=70). On-hand=0, in-transit=105 (ordered P1) showed arrived=0 in P1 conclude \u2014 a single delayed/no-arrival signal but not yet sustained. Use promised lead time (default) while basing demand forecast on the recent high-demand regime to avoid understocking. Selected recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-2019-01-21 regime (three recent samples). This raises base_stock to serve higher demand while keeping lead-time assumption unchanged until multiple concluded arrivals allow revision.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Demand shows a clear regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent weekly samples: 48,72,90). On-hand=0, in-transit=202 but no concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1/P2 have not arrived), so do NOT infer lead-time change from absent arrivals. Use promised lead time while demand estimate uses the post-changepoint regime. Set L=default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (weeks 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04), balancing service level against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=348; three consecutive conclude messages show ordered but no arrivals (possible delays/losses) but no concluded arrivals to change lead-time estimate, so keep promised lead time. Demand regime shift confirmed earlier (weeks from 2019-01-21 show higher demand; recent sample mean ~70). I set L to default (promised=4). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (uses the three most recent high samples). For sigma_hat use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These params bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand has jumped (historical samples and last 4 periods: 67,128,123,75) compared with earlier low values; on-hand=0, in-transit=510 (pending arrivals not yet visible). No concluded arrivals exist to update lead time, so keep L as promised to avoid over-adjusting. Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (N=4 equals the four most recent demand observations). This biases the base-stock toward current demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures observed volatility. These choices balance service (capture surge) against holding cost given high profit margin.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (recent weekly demands: 67,128,123,75,74). On-hand=31, in-transit=503; prior P1 order arrival confirms at least one 4-period lead time. I set L via observed average (calculate) to acknowledge confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime using the last 5 samples. Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices aim to size base stock for the elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits new ordering risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent data confirm a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent weekly mean (48,72,90)=70 vs prior mean 8.5. Lead time evidence (Period5 & Period6 concludes) shows observed lead times = 4. On-hand=46, in-transit=448; pipeline is large but lead time remains 4 so orders still cover upcoming demand. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (the post-changepoint samples 48,72,90) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean to capture the new higher regime. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices raise target base-stock to meet the confirmed higher demand while using observed lead time to avoid underordering despite existing large pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent on-hand=117, in-transit=302; confirmed actual lead time=4 (observed historically). Recent demand regime is higher than older history: recent sales (Periods 3-7) = [123,75,74,82,75], recent mean ~85.8. I set L to default (promised 4). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor the (1+L)\xd7mean to the elevated recent regime and avoid under-ordering. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service level (capture sustained higher demand) against holding cost given strong on-hand + in-transit position.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (recent weeks materially above early Jan). Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods (arrivals from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). On-hand=187, in-transit=228 so pipeline coverage is healthy, but we still set parameters to reflect the higher recent demand. I choose L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the post-changepoint regime (use last 6 demand samples) so the OR backend builds a base-stock sized for the new higher mean and variability, balancing the high unit profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) to maintain service while avoiding excessive holdings.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=246, in-transit=220. Recent demand has stabilized in higher regime since 2019-01-21 (recent demands ~75,74,82,75,92,39; mean \u224873). Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods in prior concludes. I set L to calculate so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed =4). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-changepoint demand mean/volatility over the most recent 6 periods; (1+L) multiplier will scale the forecast for the 5-period review+lead coverage. This balances service (higher recent demand) versus holding cost given substantial on-hand and in-transit inventory and confirmed LT.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (recent higher mean). On-hand=257, in-transit=178 => pipeline=435 units (covers multiple weeks). I set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (N=3 equals the detected regime length). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the new higher mean while limiting excess safety stock given current large pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Demand shifted up starting 2019-01-21 (recent regime mean ~70 vs prior ~8.5). On-hand=209, in-transit=178 (pipeline ample vs immediate demand). Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4. Set L by calculating observed lead times to match confirmed LT=4. For demand, use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (samples 48,72,90) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat reflects recent volatility; this prioritizes service in the new regime while limiting excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 (multiple arrivals matched orders placed 4 periods earlier) and a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21 (samples show much larger weekly demand vs early Jan). Current on-hand=254 + in-transit=90 = 344 units provides strong coverage vs historical weekly mean; no evidence of lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time to keep alignment with observed confirmations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving the established higher-demand regime in forecasts while letting OR backend apply its service-level cap given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-13. On-hand=316 and in-transit=107 (large pipeline); recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10, P8\u2192P12, P9\u2192P13) \u2014 strong evidence actual lead time =4. Demand regime shift to higher rates was previously recorded starting 2019-01-21; recent weekly demand has softened (weeks with 39,31,48,43,28) but not a sustained new regime. To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand + pipeline, keep L estimated from observed lead times (calculate) so backend uses realized lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base stock from full sample history, allowing it to cap orders via its cap and avoid aggressive replenishment.

Demand experienced a sustained regime increase in late Jan (already recorded). No new sustained changepoints detected. Use promised/confirmed lead time to keep OR backend aligned with observed arrivals. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), leveraging full sample history and the confirmed L=4 to balance service level versus holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27. Recent demand (Periods 11-15 = 48,43,28,32,26) shows a lower, stable regime vs. the early surge; lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history. To align the base-stock with the recent lower demand and minimize holding cost (holding $1 vs profit $19), I use a lead-time estimate derived from observed arrivals and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current regime while keeping volatility estimated from the same window.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Confirmed lead time = 4 (carry-over). Recent demand has settled well below the early spike; last 5 observed weekly demands = [43,28,32,26,25], mean=30.8. On-hand=233 + in-transit=148 provides ample coverage currently, but use recent demand to avoid excess holding. Set L to promised (default=4), mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new lower regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5), and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This biases orders toward lower target stock to balance $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Recent demand has settled at a lower regime (~last 7 weeks mean \u224834 units/week) after the early high-Jan spike; on-hand=310 and in-transit=41 provide strong coverage vs. expected demand. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods; use promised/default lead time. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime, set demand forecast using recent_N (last 7 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets an appropriate base-stock while avoiding excess holding given holding cost $1/unit. This balances service level (using recent demand mean) against inventory carrying costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=304, in-transit=23; recent weekly demand settled in the 20\u201340 range after the large early-Jan spike. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple P arrivals). I set L via 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirms 4). I use mu_hat='recent_N' with N=12 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 12 demand observations (captures the post-spike stabilized regime). I keep sigma_hat='default' to use overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices keep service high given abundant on-hand inventory while avoiding overreaction to early high spike and controlling holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has settled at the lower post-spike regime (most recent 5 demands: 26,25,30,24,15; mean=24). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand (312) plus small in-transit (3) far exceed (1+L)*recent mean (5*24=120), so no aggressive replenishment is needed. I set L to default (promised 4), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand regime, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps the base-stock anchored to the subdued demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

Set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 4).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=283, in-transit=3 => ample coverage vs. current demand; no overdue arrivals visible. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I choose L by calculation (reflect observed lead times), set mu_hat using a recent_N forecast to capture the current lower-demand regime (N=10 to focus on the most recent 10 demand samples), and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent demand volatility.

Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior conclude messages. On-hand (251) + in-transit (3)=254 comfortably covers (1+L) periods at the recent demand rate, so use a recent-window forecast to reflect the new lower regime and avoid excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=217, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 and multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability, set lead time via observed average and estimate demand using the most recent regime samples (use N=20) so the OR backend targets service while limiting excess holding given high on-hand stock.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=206, in-transit=62. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time (multiple orders observed arriving after 4 periods) and no evidence of lost shipments recently; the order placed in Period 25 (62u) is not yet due to arrive. Demand since Period 11 has been in a lower, stable regime (~20\u201332/week); I therefore set L by calculating observed lead times and set demand forecast using a recent-window to capture the current low-stable regime. Methods chosen: L='calculate' to firmly use observed lead times (all recent conclues =4), mu_hat='recent_N' with N=15 to use the last ~15 demand samples covering the stable post-spike regime, sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=15 to capture recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine toward a lower (post-spike) base stock, reducing holding cost while preserving service given confirmed 4-period lead time and ample on-hand inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent weekly demand has stabilized well below the early spike (recent weeks ~11\u201332, ~20\u201330 mean). On-hand=179 + in-transit=62 gives healthy coverage vs. current demand; no shipments appear overdue. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period actual lead time. I set L by averaging observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period reality. For demand I use recent_N (N=16) to base (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (avoiding the early large-spike samples which would overstate needs). This keeps base-stock reasonable to balance high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) and avoids excess inventory while preserving service.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. Recent weekly demand has settled well below the early 2019 peak; last several periods show demands mostly in the 11\u201356 range (recent spike to 56 in P27). On-hand=123 + in-transit=62 = 185 units provide multi-week coverage. Lead time historically observed = 4 in concluded messages; use calculated lead time to reflect confirmed observations. To keep targets responsive to the lower recent demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 (captures roughly the last 10 demand samples to estimate current mean and volatility across the (1+L) review+lead window). This reduces overstocking relative to the early high-demand regime while preserving service given current pipeline; it also implicitly guards versus lost shipments by using observed lead-time.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=71, in-transit=62 -> healthy pipeline but recent weekly demand has moderated since spring. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (observed repeatedly), so use calculated average lead time. To capture current lower-demand regime (recent weeks avg ~29 units/week over last 8 weeks), set demand forecast using recent data: use last 8 samples to compute (1+L)*mean. Volatility also estimated from the same recent window so safety stock reflects current variability and avoids excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Recent demand (Periods 20-29) shows a lower, relatively stable regime with occasional spikes; using the last 10 weeks captures current mean and volatility while smoothing spikes. I set L to calculate (use observed average lead time=4) so the OR backend accounts for confirmed lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 to forecast (1+L)-period demand and variability based on the most recent regime, balancing service (profit $19 vs holding $1) and limiting holding cost given already healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=21, in-transit=96. Promised lead time is 4 and prior concludes (Period6) confirmed LT=4; no sustained new lead-time signal. Demand has been higher in recent weeks (Periods 26-30: 27,56,52,32,80) versus earlier post-January regime, so I bias forecasts to recent observations. Set L=default to trust promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime while smoothing shorter noise (N=8 balances responsiveness and stability). This raises the backend base_stock to better cover upcoming (L+1) periods of elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N provides an empirical variability for safety-stock calculation.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent weekly demand has surged (last 5 demands: 56,52,32,80,152) after earlier regime shift in Jan. On-hand=0, in-transit=172; with promised L=4, review+lead horizon=(1+L)=5 weeks. Using recent_N=5 for demand mean captures the current uptick (mean \u224874.4/week) so the OR backend builds a base-stock reflective of the new level. Use recent_N=5 for sigma to capture current volatility. L kept at default (promised 4; confirmed historically). No new sustained lead-time or demand regime changes to record.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=324 (covers multiple future periods given L=4). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 (Period5 onward). Recent demand has stepped up with large weekly spikes in Sep (Periods 30-32: 80,152,153) indicating a higher recent mean than long-run. I set L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent regime (roughly the last 6 weeks including the Sep surge) where mean and volatility are materially higher; N=6 respects the regime detection rule and keeps the base-stock responsive to current high demand while the OR backend will cap orders using its cap. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the recent spike) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=442. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has risen sharply in the last 4 periods (P30\u2013P33 demand = 80,152,153,522). I set L via 'calculate' to reflect confirmed observed lead time. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (short recent window to react quickly). These choices give the OR backend a forecast and volatility driven by the latest observed spike while respecting the confirmed lead time and current large pipeline, balancing service level against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 30: prior avg (Periods 24\u201329)=32.5, recent avg (Periods 30\u201333)=226.75 (+598%).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=959 \u2014 pipeline is large but demand remains elevated; promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I set L to default to use the promised lead time (confirmed historically). For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201334) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the elevated mean and volatility while the capped policy will limit excessive short-term orders given the large in-transit volume.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Demand has a sustained high regime since Period 30 (demands: P30-P35 = 80,152,153,522,192,130). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. On-hand=0, in-transit=1389 \u2014 significant pipeline that will cover multiple upcoming weeks but recent demand regime is much higher, so forecast should use recent samples. Set L by observed lead times (calculate). Set mu_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (N=6, periods 30\u201335) to capture the new mean; set sigma_hat using recent_N N=6 to reflect elevated volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the confirmed high-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline limits excessive incremental ordering.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=47, in-transit=1460 => substantial pipeline but recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 30 (sharp jump vs prior). Observed concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (many samples P5..P36). I set L using calculate to lock actual observed lead time = 4. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 30\u201336) to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 weeks) and set sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the new higher mean while using recent volatility so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost given the large pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand regime: large sustained spike starting Period 30 (weeks 30\u201337 show much higher demand vs earlier periods). On-hand=99, in-transit=1285 \u2014 ample pipeline to cover upcoming (L+1)=5 periods at elevated demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (confirming 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 30\u201337) to capture the new high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, so the OR engine builds base stock for the current elevated mean and volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent weeks show the high-demand regime that began around Period 30 (large spikes; e.g., Periods 30\u201338 demands: 80,152,153,522,192,130,105,123,156). On-hand=499, in-transit=776 -> healthy pipeline but demand volatility remains elevated. Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. I set L by calculating observed lead times, and I forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime (use last 9 periods since the changepoint at Period 30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the new regime while capping orders via its cap rule.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 30 (Periods 30\u201339 demands: 80,152,153,522,192,130,105,123,156,79; avg \u2248 169). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals). I set L by calculation to reflect observed lead times. For demand forecast I use recent_N=10 (the recent high-demand regime length) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 samples, capturing the elevated demand. Sigma_hat uses recent_N=10 to reflect volatility in this recent regime. These choices keep pipeline aligned to the confirmed longer/high-demand regime, prioritizing service (profit >> holding cost) while letting the OR backend cap orders via its cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=1053, in-transit=172. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period arrivals (multiple orders observed with lead_time=4). Demand regime increased starting Period 30 (sustained high demands through Period 40). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=4. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=11 (Periods 30\u201340) to capture the new high-demand regime for the (1+L)-period forecast. I set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices align the OR backend with the confirmed longer/high-demand regime, improving service while limiting excess holding costs given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand regime (starting Period 30) is materially higher: last 12-period mean demand \u2248155 units/week (Periods 30\u201341 total=1862, n=12). On-hand 979 + in-transit 217 = 1196 units, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 mean\u2248775 units, so inventory is ample. No new sustained lead-time signal \u2014 historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show lead_time=4. I therefore use promised lead time (default) and set demand parameters using the recent high-demand regime (recent_N, N=12) so the OR engine bases base-stock on the current elevated mean and recent variability; this balances service level needs against holding cost given current large on-hand/pipeline position.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 30 (carry-over: recent avg ~226.75) vs prior low regime. On-hand=716, in-transit=196 \u2014 ample current cover but demand remains elevated (large weekly spikes e.g., P33=522, P42=310). Lead times observed consistently at 4 periods. To reflect the persistent high-demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N for demand mean and volatility over the detected high-demand regime (N=13 periods, Periods 30\u201342) so the OR engine's base-stock targets service under the new regime while limiting overstock risk given holding cost=$1. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments is needed (arrivals have been consistent).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows the large demand regime that began at Period 30 persists (many high-demand weeks since P30). On-hand=776 + in-transit=458 provides ample coverage today, but demand regime remains elevated so forecast should use recent regime stats. Lead time observations (concluded messages) consistently show 4 periods; use promised/default. For demand mean and volatility use recent_N to focus the estimate on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (regime length ~14 periods, choose N=14) so base-stock reflects elevated demand while sigma captures recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts under high demand) against holding cost by not using the long-run low-demand mean.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history shows the high-demand regime that started at Period 30 persists (large weekly demands since then). On-hand=734 + in-transit=454 provides a large buffer vs recent weekly demand, but we must keep service during the sustained high regime. Observed concluded lead times have repeatedly been 4 periods; no strong evidence to change promised lead time. I therefore use default lead time (promised=4). For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the post-Period-30 high-demand regime (use last 16 periods to cover Periods 30\u201345). I apply the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect volatility in this regime. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the sustained higher mean while accounting for observed variability, balancing profit-driven service level against holding cost given current large on-hand+pipleline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=724 and in-transit=409 provide strong coverage, but recent volatility and a confirmed lead time=4 argue we should size demand forecast using the most recent regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current holiday/volatile demand pattern and let the OR backend compute base_stock reflecting profit vs holding cost tradeoff.
