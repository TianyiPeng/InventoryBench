Demand analysis: recent 4-week demand (Periods 43-46) = [24,19,26,25], avg \u224824 units/week, stable at a low regime established since Period 24 (~\u2248100 drop earlier). Lead time & pipeline: historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand 21 + in-transit 210 = 231 units available to cover future demand. Coverage requirement: (L+1)=5 periods \xd7 forecast 24 \u2248 120 units. Inventory decision: pipeline already exceeds required coverage; ordering would increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) without raising sales. Final action: place no order this period.",
