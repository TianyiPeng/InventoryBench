Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04): [84,54,56,70,72], mean\u224867.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 -> no arrivals observed; no concluded lead-time data to contradict promised L=4. Use default lead time so backend uses promised L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean of all samples and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (covering L+1 periods of typical demand) vs holding cost without overreacting to limited data or unobserved shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) avg \u224867.2 units/week; no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 ordered=88 arrived=0), so actual lead time is still unknown. On-hand 0 + in-transit 88 is well below (1+L)\xd7mean for promised L=4, so we keep default lead time and use population historical statistics to let the OR backend compute base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost while remaining conservative given uncertain arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent concluded periods show large observed demand (P1:81, P2:199) but no arrivals yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=178. Only two consecutive missed arrivals\u2014insufficient evidence to declare lost shipments or a persistent lead-time change. Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates to avoid overreacting to short noise. Set L to default (promised 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of a sustained regime shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent observed demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show weekly mean \u224867 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=349 (sum of prior orders), and promised lead time=4. In-transit covers several weeks of expected demand; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time not confirmed. I use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this is conservative given no evidence of a sustained demand or lead-time regime change and avoids overreacting to the recent large unobserved demands in Periods 1\u20133.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Historical weekly demand samples (84,54,56,70,72) give mean\u224867.2 and std\u224812.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (sum of prior orders). Promised lead time=4; no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 this is expected because orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 would arrive during Periods 5\u20138 and only be reported in later conclude messages. Pipeline (576) comfortably exceeds (1+L)*mean = 5*67.2 \u2248 336, so no adjustment to forecast or lead time is warranted. I therefore use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation and will likely order zero or a minimal capped amount, balancing service level and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=593. Concluded history shows an arrival in Period 5 of an order placed in Period 1 => observed lead time = 4 (matches promised). Recent demand (Periods 2-5 = 199,245,132,136) is materially higher than older historical samples (2019-01 series mean \u224867). I treat this as a sustained upward regime (4 periods) and set demand forecasts using the recent regime. Choices: L=default to keep promised lead time (observed arrival supports it); mu_hat=recent_N with N=4 so backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 4 demand samples (captures the new high-demand regime); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This raises base stock to protect service during higher demand while relying on pipeline (593 units) to cover imminent demand and avoiding overreaction to older low-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 2: avg increased from 67.2 (2019-01 samples) to 178.0 (Periods 2-5) (+165%), sustained for 4 periods

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period 2 (regime from Periods 2-5). Two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders in P1->arrived P5, P2->arrived P6). On-hand=0, in-transit=771 (large pipeline). Set L via observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 4 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (capture the sustained demand increase) while letting the OR engine cap ordering given the large in-transit pipeline to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand is elevated and volatile (Periods 2-7 demands = 199,245,132,136,243,302) vs pre-period baseline. On-hand=0, in-transit=894 (large pipeline). Three concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 consistently. I therefore use calculated lead time (average observed) to reflect confirmed 4-period reality. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to focus the forecast on the new higher regime (N=6 = available recent regime length). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to capture current volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward meeting the sustained higher demand while accounting for the large in-transit pipeline and confirmed lead time to avoid over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $908.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand is much higher than the Jan baseline (sustained spike since Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=947 (multiple arrivals observed on P5-P8). Observed arrivals show consistent 4-period transit for recent orders; thus set L to be calculated from observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the new, higher-demand regime (Periods 4-8: demands 132,136,243,302,343) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current elevated mean and volatility. These parameters raise the base stock to improve service during the sustained high-demand regime while sigma_hat captures variability to avoid stockouts; using observed lead-time via calculate prevents underordering if promised lead time were inaccurate.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (orders: P1->arrived P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand has shifted up and remains high since Period 2 (recent high-demand samples: P2\u2013P9). On-hand=0, in-transit=1231 (covers ~5.5 expected periods at recent demand). Use promised lead time (confirmed = 4). For demand forecast use recent regime (changepoint at P2) \u2014 compute mu_hat from last 8 periods (P2\u2013P9) to capture the sustained higher mean (mean(P2\u2013P9)=226 units/period \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u2248 1130). Use sigma_hat from the same recent 8 samples to reflect current volatility (std(P2\u2013P9)\u224873.8; backend will scale by sqrt(1+L)). This balances service (capture higher current demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has shifted up and sustained since Period 2; last 9-period mean (P2\u2013P10) = 241 units/week, so expected demand over (1+L)=5 periods \u2248 1,205 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=1001 which is below that forecast \u2192 need higher target. Lead time historically observed = 4 periods; use calculate to reflect confirmed LT. Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the post-change regime (P2\u2013P10) so base-stock targets track the sustained higher demand while sigma is estimated from the same window to set an appropriate service buffer.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Demand has been in a higher regime since early periods (recent period demands: P5=136, P6=243, P7=302, P8=343, P9=208, P10=361, P11=392). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1067 (covers multiple future periods). I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (covering the last 7 observed demand periods P5\u2013P11) so mu_hat reflects the new, sustained higher demand regime and sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to capture current volatility; this balances higher target base-stock to avoid lost sales while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 2 (sustained high weekly demand ~200-400 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=1222 (covers multiple future weeks at elevated demand). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes; use promised/default lead time. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent elevated regime (N=11 periods of observed high demand) so the OR engine sizes base-stock and safety stock to service the higher demand while the large pipeline reduces immediate stockout risk. No new sustained changepoint or lead-time update to carry forward.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=122, in-transit=1118 \u2014 large pipeline consistent with prior confirmed lead time=4. Recent demand has been well above the Jan baseline (sustained higher regime); last 9 demand observations (Periods 5\u201313) capture current demand level and variability. Use promised lead time (default=4) and set mu_hat/sigma_hat from recent_N with N=9 to reflect the current elevated demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend computes a higher base-stock while capping order size to limit excess inventory.

Pipeline (1457) covers multiple future periods but demand remains high and variable; to keep service while limiting holding cost, use recent demand data to set forecast and volatility. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 2 (average demand much higher than the Jan samples) and confirmed actual lead time=4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=52, in-transit=1325 \u2014 pipeline large relative to demand, so avoid over-ordering. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 4) consistent with confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N with N=14 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 2\u201315) so mu_hat reflects the new mean over the full post-changepoint regime. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=14 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward servicing the higher, sustained demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits new orders via the OR cap, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Recent demand has been well above the historical Jan samples (historical mean 67.2) \u2014 a sustained higher regime was observed starting Period 2 and recent periods show large weekly demand (many 200\u2013390 range). On-hand=104 + in-transit=1014 provides substantial coverage against the 4-period lead time confirmed by prior conclues. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (all observed =4). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while limiting noise from the low historical Jan samples; N=8 balances recency and sample size given the sustained shift. These parameters push the backend base-stock toward meeting higher demand (reducing stockouts) while sigma_hat from recent data keeps safety stock moderate to control holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Recent demand has settled at a higher regime: last 9 demands (P9\u2013P17) average \u2248314.7/week. On-hand (107) + in-transit (1160)=1267, which is below the (1+L)\xd7recent mean needed to cover review+lead demand. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; use promised/default L. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 9 samples = 5\xd7314.7 \u22481573.5) so base-stock reflects elevated demand and prevents stockouts. Set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=9) to reflect recent volatility for safety stock sizing. This balances service (avoid lost sales given high profit $4 vs $1 holding) while keeping holding risk accounted for via recent volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent realized demand has been in a higher regime since Period 2 (sustained elevated demand many periods). On-hand=204, in-transit=1204 (pipeline large vs demand). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history; keep promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N demand estimates using the most recent regime length (~17 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current mean/volatility and avoid dilution by the small Jan samples. This balances service (meet high demand) vs holding cost given large pipeline by relying on recent observed demand statistics.

I choose L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 10\u201319) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean across the review+lead window and sigma_hat uses recent volatility over the same window. This balances service (capture recent higher demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). History shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals P1->P5 ... P4->P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=1383 (large pipeline). Demand shifted up after Period 1 and has remained elevated through Period 20. I set L=calculate to use observed lead-time average (confirms 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=19 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime from Period 2 onward (use the most recent 19 demand samples to form (1+L) forecast). Sigma uses recent_N N=19 to reflect current volatility rather than the low pre-shift variance. These choices bias the base-stock toward meeting the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit reduces additional ordering via the OR cap.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4; demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 5 (many recent weeks with demand ~260-392). To reflect the sustained elevated demand I set L to default (promised=4, consistent with observed), use recent_N for demand and volatility to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (N=17 covers Periods 5\u201321), which raises (1+L)\xd7mean and std to match current demand and thus balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime increase earlier in the run. Current inventory: on-hand=445, in-transit=922. I choose default lead time to honor the promised L=4 (matches observed). Use default demand sizing (mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean(all samples)) and default volatility (sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)) so the OR backend uses its full-sample estimates while capping orders; this balances service (high recent demand) against holding cost given substantial pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=384, in-transit=795. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 2. I keep L at promised (use default) while forecasting demand using the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N (N=20) to capture the last ~20 periods of elevated demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to service (1+L) periods of this new regime. This balances higher service needs against holding cost given large on-hand+pipleine.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (noted in carry-over) and confirmed actual lead time = 4. Current inventory: on-hand=679, in-transit=718 (large pipeline). Using promised/confirmed lead time (default) keeps L=4. Given large on-hand + pipeline and no new short-term signal, use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies its full-sample mean/STD (stable policy) and avoids overreacting to short noise. This balances service (high current stock) versus holding cost by not inflating forecasted demand further.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=709, in-transit=567. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods, so set lead time estimation to calculated (average observed). Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; last 5 concluded demands (P21\u2013P25 = 198,209,188,109,121) average ~165 units. To keep service while limiting holding cost given large on-hand, use recent_N (N=5) for both demand mean and volatility so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility rather than the distant Jan samples. This balances profit-driven service level against current high inventory and holding cost.

Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=818, in-transit=327. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time = 4 periods. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 2 (sustained); to focus the forecast on the current regime I use recent data to compute demand over the review+lead horizon. This keeps base-stock responsive to the elevated demand while limiting excess stock via the OR cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift earlier (higher weekly demand since Period 2). Current on-hand=723 and in-transit=668 \u2014 ample coverage versus expected (L+1) periods of demand. Given confirmed LT=4 and no new sustained changepoint in the last several weeks, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its full-sample mean/variance (provides conservative replenishment vs holding cost). This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by letting backend compute base_stock and cap using all available samples and the promised L.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has fallen from earlier high peaks to a roughly ~80-131 range over the last 5 weeks (Periods 24-28 demands: 109,121,131,95,80). On-hand = 970, in-transit = 341 (pipeline large relative to recent demand -> risk of excess holding cost). Lead time history shows consistent 4-period arrivals; use observed lead-time average. To avoid over-ordering given high pipeline and lower recent demand, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times=4), set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent low-demand regime, and set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent lower volatility. This reduces target base-stock and caps order quantities to limit holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=882, in-transit=341. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 and a sustained demand regime shift (Periods 2-5 onward) to much higher weekly demand vs the 2019-01 seed samples. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility to capture recent weeks while keeping lead time at the promised/confirmed 4. This increases target base-stock to prioritize service given high profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent demand has settled at a much lower regime (~80-131 over the last 7 weeks) compared with the early high-demand months; lead time has been previously confirmed as 4 periods. On-hand (786) plus in-transit (491) is ample vs recent demand, so use a recent-window demand estimate to avoid overstock. Set L to default (promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime and reduced variability, which reduces target base-stock and holding cost while preserving service for the observed regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=1048, in-transit=150 \u2014 ample cover vs. short-term demand; no obvious lost shipments. Lead-time history consistently shows 4 periods, so use promised/default L.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has settled to a low steady regime: last 6 sold = [95, 80, 88, 96, 79, 72], mean \u2248 85.0 units/week. On-hand = 976, in-transit = 150 \u2014 pipeline is healthy and no new lost shipments observed; historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. I set L using recent observed lead times implicitly by using 'calculate' confirmation of 4, and I forecast demand using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low-demand regime (reduces excess holding). Sigma is set using recent_N (N=6) to reflect current volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk while maintaining service given long confirmed LT=4.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has been modest with one spike in P33 (183); on-hand=793 + in-transit=150 gives 943 units of available/pipeline stock. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To keep responsiveness to recent demand while avoiding excess stock given current large on-hand, I base demand forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations (recent_N N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine weights current lower-week demand but can react to the P33 spike.

On-hand 850 + in-transit 260 = 1,110 units \u2014 ample coverage for the upcoming review+lead horizon. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history, so use calculated/observed lead-time. To avoid overstock while preserving service, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (captures current lower-demand regime) so the OR engine targets roughly (1+L)*recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability. This keeps target inventory moderate given large existing on-hand stock and reduces unnecessary ordering/holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
2019-10-21: on-hand=799, in-transit=260; confirmed historical actual lead time=4 (carry-over). Recent demand has settled to ~80 units/week with occasional spikes (last 5 weeks mean ~80, last 10 weeks used for stability). Inventory + pipeline comfortably covers demand for multiple weeks; keep promised lead time so backend aligns with observed arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to focus forecasts on the most recent regime and reduce influence of early high-demand samples; this balances holding cost against service (profit=4, holding=1 implies moderate service target).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Current on-hand=746, in-transit=260 (strong pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4; recent demand (Periods 33-37 = 183,50,43,51,53) shows lower steady weekly sales with one spike. To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand and pipeline, keep L as promised (default=4) and forecast demand using the most recent regime: use the last 5 samples to capture current lower demand (reduces base stock vs long-run mean). Use recent_N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility including the one spike. These settings bias the OR engine toward lower order quantities while preserving service during the (1+L)=5 period lookahead.

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=684, in-transit=260; profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical conclude messages confirm a sustained demand regime shift earlier and lead time = 4 observed. No new sustained changepoint in recent periods (inventory large vs recent weekly demand ~50-180). To keep policy aligned with proven lead time and long-run demand stats, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given high on-hand stock while letting the backend cap orders to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. Recent demand has settled lower since ~Period 27 (Aug) vs earlier high-volatility spring; historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4. On-hand 901 + in-transit 149 = 1050 units cover several weeks of current demand. I keep L at promised (default = 4) and use recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained lower-demand regime from Period 27\u201339 (13 periods) so the OR engine sizes base-stock and cap to current demand levels and avoids excess holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent weekly demand has settled much lower (~40\u201360 units/week) vs the high-demand regime earlier in the year; on-hand=845, in-transit=149 is ample coverage. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in conclude history, so use promised/default L=4. To reflect the recent low-demand regime and reduce excess inventory, set mu_hat using a recent_N mean to capture the current regime (N=20 most recent demand samples). Volatility has also compressed, so set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent std. These choices steer the OR engine to a lower base stock aligned with recent demand while acknowledging the 4-period lead time and avoiding over-ordering given large on-hand inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent weekly demand has been low (~40\u201390) for many periods versus the early high-demand regime; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in history. On-hand=801, in-transit=149 gives large coverage; to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use promised lead time and base forecasts from the most recent demand regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the latest 20 observed demands, which captures the post-peak lower-demand regime and reduces overstock risk.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep promised lead time and shrink forecast to recent demand by using recent_N over the last 20 samples for both mean and volatility so the OR backend reduces order quantities given current stock overhang.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Current on-hand=786, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock relative to recent weekly demand (typically 40\u2013140/week historically). Promised lead time = 4 and prior periods confirm actual LT=4; no evidence of further LT drift. Given high on-hand and positive holding cost (1$/unit/period) vs profit (4$/unit), avoid inflating forecasts; let OR backend use default demand stats over (1+L) review+lead window. Methods chosen (default for L, mu_hat, sigma_hat) rely on promised LT and historical sample stats so backend will likely order little-to-none and minimize holding cost while satisfying service-level target implied by profit/holding ratio.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16. Recent weekly demand has been in a low, stable winter regime (~Periods 27-44) versus earlier high-demand spring spike; on-hand=767, in-transit=248 provides ample coverage vs current low demand. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent stable regime to avoid the earlier spring spike bias: mu_hat and sigma_hat use the last 18 demand samples (Periods 27-44) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility reflective of the current low-winter regime, reducing excess ordering and holding cost while maintaining service.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=741, in-transit=248. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and an earlier sustained demand regime shift (not reversed). Recent weekly demand (Dec) is low but not a sustained new regime. To keep the OR engine aligned with proven lead time and long-run demand stats, use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use confirmed L=4) versus holding costs given large on-hand stock.

Recent history shows stable actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in prior insights) and on-hand=716 with in-transit=267 \u2014 inventory is plentiful vs. typical weekly demand (recent weeks ~20\u2013140). To avoid unnecessary extra stock and high holding cost, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This leverages the confirmed L=4 while letting the backend's capped ordering rule limit order sizes given current large pipeline, balancing service level and holding cost.
