  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, pre-New Year). Recent Black Friday spike (Period 42=385) is isolated; demand since then (P43-P46) averages ~118 units/week (111,105,117,140). Demand regime shift to higher mean was already recorded (Periods 17+). Lead time: confirmed 4 periods and current in-transit (371) equals orders from P43-P46, so no arrivals will occur before Period 51. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=62; in-transit=371 (arrive in 4 periods). Forecast next 5 weeks (L+1=5) demand ~5*118=590. Available supply covering those 5 periods without new order = 62+371=433. Shortfall \u2248 590-433 = 157. Add small buffer for variability (~10%) => ~173. To avoid future lost sales while minimizing costly holding, place an order to cover estimated 5-period shortfall. Conservatively choose 167 units as the order quantity.",
