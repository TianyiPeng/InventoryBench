Demand: long-run historical mean ~112.6 but a sustained higher regime was recorded starting Period 17 (avg \u2248176); recent four-week demands (P42\u2013P45) are 385,111,105,117 \u2014 P42 is an outlier spike likely single-period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (already recorded). Inventory: on-hand=10, in-transit=150 => pipeline_inventory (on-hand + in-transit)=160. Demand assessment: historical mean from provided samples = 112.6 units/week; recent periods show intermittent spikes (Period 17\u201320 regime shift previously recorded) but the most recent weeks (Periods 42\u201346) average \u2248171 with one extreme spike (Period 42=385). Given this mixed signal and high holding cost (holding=$1 equals profit=$1 \u2192 critical fractile q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), the OR baseline (which uses promised L=4 and historical mean) yields a conservative base-stock recommendation. Risk tradeoff: because holding cost equals profit, overstocking is costly and safety stock should be minimal absent a sustained new regime. The OR capped recommendation is 213 units; it already accounts for pipeline in its calculation. I will follow the OR recommendation of 213 units to cover expected (L+1)-period demand while not aggressively overshooting given high holding cost and no new 3+ period sustained signal since the last recorded regime change.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR's capped recommendation of 213 units \u2014 confirmed lead time=4, pipeline=160, historical mean \u2248112.6 and holding cost equals profit so avoid aggressive over-ordering despite intermittent spikes.",
