Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time; historical weekly demand samples (through 2019-02-04) will be used. No sustained changepoint or lead-time evidence, so use promised lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation to let the OR backend compute base stock consistent with historical mean and variance.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=314 (ordered P1). Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (148,175,160,233,308) show recent uptick but not yet 3+ periods sustained. Using default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters data-driven and avoids overreacting to a single high week; in-transit 314 is below the (1+L)-period demand implied by history, so backend will order to refill toward the base stock.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two consecutive orders (P1:314, P2:321) remain unarrived and are currently in-transit=635; starting on-hand=0. Promised lead time is 4 periods and only 2 periods have elapsed since the earliest outstanding order, so delays are not yet confirmed as lost\u2014treat lead time as promised. Historical demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~204.8/week; use default calculations to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (covering forecast over review+lead period) against holding cost while awaiting conclusive lead-time evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=980 (orders from P1-P3) and no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed; use promised lead time. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-3) = [266,316,306], mean=296, well above earlier historical sample mean\u2248205, indicating a sustained upward regime over 3 periods. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet the higher realized demand while the in-transit pipeline is monitored for late/lost arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: avg increased from ~205 to 296 (+44%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent realized weekly demand has shifted up (Periods 1-4 demands = 266,316,306,283; recent mean ~292.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=1320 (matches orders placed P1-P4), so shipments are delayed but not yet concluded \u2014 no confirmed lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend assumes L=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher regime (weights the last 4 observed weekly demands). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These settings help the OR engine size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods under the new higher-demand regime while acknowledging in-transit inventory is outstanding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4726.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history shows demands P1-P5 = [266,316,306,283,252]; on-hand=62, in-transit=1233 (large pipeline). Period 5 conclude confirmed an arrival from P1 (lead_time=4). I keep L as promised (default) because observed lead_time matches promised. Demand has recently been higher than earlier historical Jan samples; to capture the current regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 periods. This balances service (capturing the elevated recent mean ~285) against holding cost given the very large pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has been elevated and sustained (Periods 1-6: 266,316,306,283,252,270) consistent with previously recorded regime shift. Lead time was confirmed as 4 periods in Period 6 and promised lead time is 4, so use default lead time. To capture the recent higher demand level I use recent_N over the last 6 observed demand periods (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant regime; this balances higher service level needs against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock (1139) and on-hand (113).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand elevated: last 3 concluded demands = [252,270,364], avg \u2248295. On-hand=94, in-transit=1044 (large pipeline). Lead time previously confirmed at 4 periods; use promised lead time. To reflect recent higher demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures the latest regime). This keeps base-stock sized to cover (1+L) periods of the recent higher demand while sigma from recent volatility controls safety stock; large pipeline mitigates stockout risk and reduces aggressive ordering.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=62, in-transit=1099; recent arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1-P4 arrived at P5-P8). Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime: last 5 demands (P4-P8) = [283,252,270,364,372], mean ~308.2. Use explicit L=4 to lock in observed lead time. Set mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated demand regime over the review+lead window (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than older historical variance. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) because pipeline is large but demand remains elevated; explicit L avoids under-ordering if actual lead time differs from promised.

To keep service while avoiding excess holding, set L based on observed data and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the elevated recent demand regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent weekly demand has risen vs. early-sample mean (last 5 demands = 270,364,372,271,310 \u2192 mean\u2248317). On-hand=0, in-transit=1446 which covers ~4.6 weeks at the recent mean; promised lead time is 4 and prior concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. To avoid stockouts versus elevated demand I set L=default (use promised 4), and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine upsizes target stock to recent demand/volatility rather than the older lower-mean samples. This balances higher service level needs while relying on large in-transit pipeline to limit excessive holding.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (arrivals from P1\u2013P7 all had W=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1518 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to typical weekly demand but last period had an isolated huge demand (564) not sustained over 3+ periods. No clear new demand regime or lead-time change. Therefore use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance (conservative given large pipeline) to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-05-06. On-hand=0, in-transit=1404. Recent demand has risen and been volatile (recent 5 demands = [372,271,310,564,424], mean=388.2). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history. I choose L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent mean (mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile: last 5 observed demands = [271, 310, 564, 424, 304], average ~374 which is above earlier baseline. On-hand=96 and in-transit=1581 (large pipeline) \u2014 pipeline plus on-hand comfortably covers multiple periods, but demand volatility (one large 564 spike) argues using recent data to capture higher short-term demand while limiting overstating long-term mean. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals ordered P1..P9 all show lead_time=4); use calculated lead time based on observations. Therefore: L via calculate to lock in observed LT=4; mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to target the (1+L)-period demand using the most recent regime; sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters balance service (capture recent higher mean) against holding cost given large current pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent weeks show high, sustained demand with several arrivals confirming actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded messages: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=66, in-transit=1754 (ample pipeline). I select L=calculate to lock in the observed lead time average (backend will compute =4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of available historical samples; with large pipeline and confirmed LT=4 this balances service level (profit/hc ratio high) vs holding cost without manual overrides. No new missing-shipment signals present.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 Period16. On-hand=0, in-transit=1495. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 7 demands: 271,310,564,424,304,431,442) versus earlier samples; to capture current regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (N=7). Keep L as default (promised 4) since observed arrivals match promised. This increases target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand while reflecting recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=1776 \u2014 substantial pipeline (covers multiple weeks of demand). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; no new evidence of change. Demand has been elevated and volatile in recent weeks (several >300, spikes to 564); to reflect the recent regime and avoid stockouts I use recent demand for forecasting. Set L to promised (default) and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand level and variability while keeping N within the recommended bounds. This yields supply target (1+L)-period forecast responsive to the recent high-demand regime and limits excess holding costs by not over-weighting older low-demand samples.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 11-17) well above earlier baseline. On-hand=0, in-transit=1768 (pipeline large). Observed lead times from concluded messages are consistently 4 periods; no evidence of lost shipments. I choose L='calculate' to lock to observed lead time average (matches promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 11-17) to capture the new high-demand regime; sigma_hat also recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters focus the backend on satisfying elevated demand while using pipeline inventory to avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). Recent demand has shifted up: Periods 11-17 show a sustained higher regime (avg ~463). All observed arrivals indicate actual lead time = 4. On-hand=155, in-transit=1836 (sufficient pipeline). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (backend will average observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to target the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 11-17) so base_stock reflects the higher mean over the review+lead window. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices increase service level for the confirmed higher-demand regime while the calculated L/ recent_N stats keep orders aligned with observed arrivals and avoid underordering due to delayed-shipment ambiguity.

Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 11-19 => N=9) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the elevated regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=261, in-transit=2065 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand remains elevated; several prior orders confirm consistent 4-period arrivals. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed =4).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime from Periods 11-17 (avg ~463) versus earlier (~296). On-hand=598, in-transit=1746 => pipeline_total=2344 (ample cover now). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods; use promised/default L to remain consistent with supplier promise. To capture the recent elevated demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (regime length = 7 periods, N = max(min(7,20),3)=7). This biases the demand forecast and variability toward the confirmed higher-demand regime so the OR backend raises base-stock for high service (profit/holding implies high q), while current large pipeline reduces immediate ordering pressure and holding costs will be constrained by the capped order logic.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand experienced a sustained higher regime starting Period 11 (Periods 11\u201317 avg=463, regime length=7). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set L to default (promised 4) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime: mu_hat recent_N with N=7 and sigma_hat recent_N with N=7. This prioritizes service for the confirmed elevated-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility; using recent samples prevents underordering due to older lower-demand data while the strong pipeline mitigates short-term stockouts.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=1376, in-transit=872 (total pipeline=2248). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; I keep promised L to match observed behavior. Demand showed a high regime around Periods 11-17 but demand has cooled in Periods 18-23 (six periods) so I use recent_N with N=6 for demand mean and volatility to reflect current regime. This keeps base-stock responsive to the recent lower demand while still covering the 5-period review+lead window; with profit >> holding cost we favor service but reduce excess stock relative to the earlier spike.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has fallen from the high regime (Periods 11-17 avg=463) into a lower level over the last 7 periods (Periods 18-24 demands = 419,439,301,232,238,212,207; recent average ~298). On-hand=1437 + in-transit=604 gives ample coverage today; no overdue lost shipments observed\u2014historical concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. I set L using recent observed lead times (calculate average) to confirm the empiric 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the post-peak downshift (use (1+L)\xd7mean over last 7 samples). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to target stock for the recent lower-demand regime while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). Current inventory: on-hand=1533, in-transit=354, which is ample coverage vs recent weekly demand (last 3 weeks: 212, 207, 154). No clear new sustained demand regime shift. Choose L based on observed lead times (calculate). Use default demand and volatility estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample; this avoids overreacting to short recent dip and keeps orders modest given large on-hand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. Recent demand has declined from the June peak; last 7 demands (Periods 20-26) = [301,232,238,212,207,154,102] indicating a lower recent regime. On-hand=1637 + in-transit=276 provides ample coverage vs near-term demand. No new sustained lead-time signal (historically confirmed as 4). Choose L=default to use promised lead time=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to make the forecast and risk estimate responsive to the recent lower demand regime and avoid overstock while preserving service.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent on-hand=1665, in-transit=128. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Demand showed a clear decline since Period 21 (recent demands: 232,238,212,207,154,102,120). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 4), and forecast demand using the most recent regime (last 7 weeks) with matched volatility. Methods: L=calculate to lock in observed lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=7) to reflect the recent lower-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=7) to capture recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg demand (Periods 21-27) = 179 vs prior 463 (\u2248 -61%), sustained 7 periods

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand regime is the low regime that began at Period 21 (weekly demand ~154\u2013238, recent values: 232,238,212,207,154,102,120,158). On-hand=1507 + in-transit=128 => ample coverage; note Period 28 conclude showed arrived=0 (a lost/zero arrival for an earlier order) but in-transit 128 (from Period 26 order) remains expected. Observed lead times from concluded arrivals are consistently 4 periods, so set L using calculated average (4). Because demand shifted down at Period 21 and has persisted (8 periods), use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current lower mean and volatility and keep inventory lean while maintaining service. These choices give the OR backend a demand forecast focused on the sustained low-demand regime and a confirmed lead time estimate.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 21 (avg ~179, recent weeks 158,140,120,102,154,158,140 \u2192 sustained reduction). On-hand = 1367, in-transit = 128 \u2014 inventory is plentiful vs recent demand; no overdue shipments (arrivals matched 4-period lag historically). I set L to calculate to confirm observed lead time (historical arrivals consistently show 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to anchor mu_hat to the lowered regime (use last 9 samples covering Periods 21\u201329). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=9) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce ordering aggressiveness given high on-hand, aligning safety stock to the new lower-demand regime and avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service.

Multiple past concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. Given very high on-hand relative to expected (1+L)-period demand, we avoid forcing extra inventory. Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) so the OR engine orders only if pipeline shortfalls appear.

Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in history; using default promised L. To match the lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates, taking the last 11 periods of demand (regime length Periods 21-31 = 11) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std on that recent window. This keeps service high for current lower demand while avoiding excessive additional holding cost given large on-hand stock and pipeline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been in the low-100s (Periods 28-32: 158,140,145,141,135) after the drop noted earlier (Period 21+). Inventory is high: on-hand 1074 + in-transit 500 = 1574 coverage >> short-run demand. Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 in concluded history. I therefore keep L as default (promised=4). To reflect the new lower-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-drop periods while staying within the allowed N bounds. This reduces target base-stock to match current lower demand and avoids excess replenishment given already-large on-hand + pipeline, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in the low regime since the Period 21->28 shift; weeks 28-35 show consistently lower weekly demand (range ~85\u2013158, regime length = 8). On-hand = 1236, in-transit = 0 (no pending arrivals). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; no evidence of lost shipments since P31 arrival. I therefore use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast I target the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=8 (regime length 8) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 8 samples) to align target base-stock with current demand. Use recent_N N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep safety stock aligned to the current lower-demand regime, avoiding excess holding while preserving service given confirmed L=4.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=1152, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has been 4 periods consistently; no new sustained lead-time shift. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 28 (~100\u2013150/week, recent 7 weeks = 145,141,135,147,106,85,84). I select L=default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to current demand and avoids excess holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). On-hand=1043, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible this period. Historical concluded lead times repeatedly =4. Recent demand (Periods 29-37) averaged ~121 units/week, substantially below the prior regime (~179). I therefore keep L at promised (use default=4) because lead time is confirmed and the backend expects promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 29-37) so mu_hat reflects the new, lower regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 9 samples). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=9 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce excessive ordering relative to the prior higher-demand regime, lowering holding costs while maintaining service for the observed lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: avg demand (Periods 29-37) = 121 vs prior 179 (\u2248 -32%), sustained 9 periods

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=965, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand vs recent low demand (last 10 periods average lower than earlier regimes). No arrivals overdue (no in-transit). Historical carry-over confirms lead time=4 and multiple past demand regime shifts; most recent stable low-demand regime spans Periods 29\u201338 (\u224810 periods). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use promised lead time (default) and estimate demand/volatility from the most recent 10 periods (recent_N=10) so the OR engine targets stocking consistent with the current low-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=904, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, etc.). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 29 (avg ~121 over P29\u2013P37; recent weeks demand ~60\u2013109). To reflect the confirmed lead time and recent low-demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent low-demand regime (N=11 covers Periods 29\u201339) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This reduces target base-stock to avoid large holding cost given high on-hand inventory and low demand while preserving service for expected demand over the review+lead window.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has settled into the low post-summer regime observed since Period 29 (weekly demands ~140\u2192down to ~60-110 most recently). On-hand is healthy (835) and in-transit = 0; no arrivals pending. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods, so use promised/default lead time. To align ordering with the current low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (~Periods 29-40, 12 samples) so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility reflecting the current lower demand and reduced variance. This reduces excess holding while maintaining service, given high profit/holding ratio (q\u22480.95) which the OR engine will convert to a high z. Using recent_N prevents overweighting earlier high-demand months and avoids creating unnecessary pipeline given zero in-transit and ample on-hand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand is 768, in-transit 0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand (Periods 35-41) has been lower than earlier regime. I set L by calculating observed lead times to keep backend aligned with confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the new low-demand regime (Periods 35-41) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses recent volatility; this reduces orders and holding cost while meeting service given current lower demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has settled at a low regime: Periods 35-42 demand = [85,84,109,78,61,69,67,109], avg \u2248 82.8, consistent with prior carry-over (regime shift at P35 to ~79). On-hand=659, in-transit=0 (no pending arrivals). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised=4). To align the OR base-stock to the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility reflect the most recent 8 weeks of demand rather than the much higher earlier samples. This reduces overstock while maintaining service given current low demand and zero pipeline. Using recent data helps the backend avoid excessive ordering when on-hand already covers multiple weeks of current demand.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in history, so keep promised lead time. To target service with low recent demand and avoid excess holding cost, set L=default (promised=4). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent data: use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 35-43) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 9 samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=9 to reflect current low-volatility regime. This keeps orders aligned to the current low-demand regime and minimizes unnecessary holding given large on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Current on-hand=543, in-transit=0; recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 35 (sustained drop). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 (orders placed P1..P31 that arrived show lead_time=4), so use calculated average lead time. Demand forecast: use a recent-window forecast to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (weights on recent weekly sales). I choose recent_N with N=9 to cover roughly the last 9 weeks (captures Periods 36\u201344 demand pattern) so mu_hat reflects the current lower mean; sigma_hat also recent_N N=9 to represent recent volatility. These parameters reduce ordering relative to older high-demand periods, avoiding excess holding cost given large on-hand inventory while still covering L+1 periods of expected demand.

Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=387, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals: P1->P5 etc.). Recent demand has been in the low-single-hundreds since the downward regime identified at Period 35; last 7 demands (Periods 40-46) = [69,67,109,61,55,64,92] showing a relatively low, slightly noisy regime. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (default) and anchor demand forecast to the most recent regime using recent_N with N=7 (captures the 7 most recent weeks of the low-demand regime). Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These parameters bias orders toward current low demand and reduce unnecessary replenishment given zero in-transit inventory and high on-hand.
