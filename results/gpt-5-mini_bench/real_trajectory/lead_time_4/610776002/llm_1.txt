Lead time & pipeline: promised lead time = 4 periods and no concluded arrivals seen yet; in-transit=0 and on-hand=0 so assume supplier lead time may hold at 4 until contradicted.

Order calc: required = forecast*(L+1) - on-hand - in-transit = 250*5 - 0 - 0 = 1250 units.

Historical recent demand (Periods 41\u201345): 67,109,61,55,64 -> recent 5-week avg \u2248 71/wk but last 3 weeks \u2248 60/wk; carry-over insight currently confirmed lower regime (~68/wk at Period 42). Lead time: confirmed 4 periods (multiple arrivals show 4). Decision calculus: must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand after ordering. Use conservative demand forecast = 70/wk \u2192 required cover = 5*70 = 350 units. Current cover = on-hand (45) + in-transit (273) = 318 \u2192 shortfall \u2248 32. Minimize stock while avoiding stockouts given 4-period lead time and holiday uncertainty. Order 40 units to cover shortfall + small safety buffer (keeps holding low vs. high lost-sales profit).",

{

Planning target: cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand = 5 * 70 \u2248350 units (rounded demand to 70/week for modest safety). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=303 \u2192 short \u224847 units to meet 5-week cover. Risk: orders may be lost or late, but recent arrivals have consistently shown 4-period lead time.
