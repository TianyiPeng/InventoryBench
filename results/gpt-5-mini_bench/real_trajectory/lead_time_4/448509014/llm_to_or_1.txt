Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU 448509014 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples: [3,175,168,106,278], mean=146 units/week indicating substantial demand but noisy. No concluded arrival history exists yet (cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments). Given lack of lead-time evidence and limited history, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies the standard (1+L) scaling to the full sample mean and std. This balances service level against holding cost while we wait for arrival/lead-time signals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent sample history (5 weeks) mean demand \u2248146/wk with high variance (std \u2248101). On-hand=0, in-transit=313 (order placed P1, arrived=0 in P1 conclude => arrival pending; no confirmed lead-time change). Use promised lead time and population statistics: set L=default so backend uses promised L=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples (Jan 2019) mean=146.0. On-hand=0, in-transit=645 (orders from P1/P2). No concluded arrivals yet for those orders; promised lead time (4) still appropriate (no evidence of lead-time shift). Use default demand aggregation to let OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and volatility with promised L=4 so pipeline + on-hand will be targeted against 5-period demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Demand history (samples) avg=146 units/week from provided samples (3,175,168,106,278). On-hand=0, in-transit=931 which equals sum of prior orders (313+332+286) but none have concluded as arrived in Periods 1-3 conclude messages. Promised lead time is 4; actual lead time cannot be confirmed from concludes yet. Because no conclude evidence contradicts promised lead time, use default L and default demand stats so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on all samples. This balances service (uses full-sample mean to meet demand) while not overreacting to unconfirmed lead-time shifts or transient demand noise. Flagged overdue in carry-over_insight for future periods.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders from Periods 1-3 (313, 332, 286 = 931 units) remain in-transit with no arrivals observed in Periods 1-3 concludes; shipments overdue relative to expected visibility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent weekly demands (samples: 3,175,168,106,278) give overall mean=146 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=997 (sum of prior orders). Promised lead time=4; use default lead time since no concluded arrivals have yet revised actual L. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) produces (1+4)\xd7mean demand to cover current review+lead period while sigma reflects observed volatility; pipeline (997) currently exceeds that 5-period demand forecast (~730), so risk of stockout is low while holding cost equals unit profit, so avoid extra safety stock beyond default policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $313.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): recent realized demand is ~300+ units/week (Periods 1-5 demands = 258,315,291,335,332) \u2014 a clear upward regime vs earlier sample set. On-hand=0, in-transit=759 (includes arrived 313 from P1 confirmed in Period 5 conclude). Several past orders were overdue but P1 arrival confirms actual lead time = 4 for that shipment. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead-times (reflects confirmed 4-period transit). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime; sigma_hat also recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise base-stock to serve the elevated demand while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit overstock given holding cost parity with profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order on Period 1 arrived Period 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-6: 258,315,291,335,332,294) is substantially higher than the Jan baseline (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04 mean=146). Lead-time evidence (Period 5 conclude: P1\u2192P5, Period 6 conclude: P2\u2192P6) consistently shows actual lead time = 4. On-hand=38, in-transit=787 (total 825) which is below coverage for (1+L)=5 periods at the new demand level. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 demand samples to capture the post-change high-demand regime and recent volatility (N=6 captures the sustained shift). These parameters steer the OR engine toward higher base stock to improve service while acknowledging holding cost with recent volatility estimates.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from 2019-01-07\u20142019-02-04 (mean=146) to 2019-02-11\u20142019-03-18 (mean=304), +108% average demand; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=854 (sustained inflow observed; recent concludes confirm actual lead_time=4). Demand has shifted to a higher regime (recent weeks much larger than Jan samples). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent-demand regime and reduce influence of low-Jan samples. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices increase base_stock to improve service in the new high-demand regime while keeping sigma tied to recent variability to avoid overstocking.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has accelerated (Period5-8: 332,294,413,521) indicating a higher recent mean and elevated volatility versus earlier samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=1202 (large pipeline). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). I set L via calculated average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=5: Periods 4-8) to capture the recent high-demand regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N to reflect increased volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend raises base-stock to meet the new demand regime while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock given the already-large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=1655 units. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Demand since 2019-02-11 is in a higher regime (recent mean ~304) with high variance. Use observed lead time (calculate) to lock L=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 9 demand samples to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and current volatility so the OR backend raises target base-stock while accounting for observed variability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and demand has experienced a sustained upward regime earlier; on-hand=161, in-transit=1295 (ample pipeline). No new sustained changepoint since Period 7. I will use the default lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (this leverages full history including the confirmed LT=4 arrivals and balances service level vs holding cost).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently observed as 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift to higher weekly demand beginning 2019-02-11 (higher mean persists through recent periods). On-hand = 338, in-transit = 942 (sizable pipeline). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the empirically observed 4-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use most recent 6 demand observations) so the OR engine targets higher base-stock and properly sizes safety stock given increased mean/variance, while the backend cap will limit excessive single-period orders given the large pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=583, in-transit=768. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time=4 (multiple P1\u2192P5...P8\u2192P12), and recent demand regime is higher (recent demands: P5-P12 = [332,294,413,521,220,199,176,169], mean\u2248290.5). Reconcile: pipeline + on-hand (1351 units) covers several periods but demand remains elevated. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (captures the sustained higher-demand regime starting around Period 5\u20137) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean over the appropriate regime and scales risk by recent volatility; this balances service (higher target stock) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

To respect confirmed lead time, use promised/default L. For demand forecast, use recent_N to capture the new higher-demand regime using recent history rather than the older low-demand samples. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set (stable estimate). This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=893, in-transit=342 (pipeline=1,235). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has moderated (Periods 10-14 demands = 199,176,169,111,107; recent avg ~152), so use a short recent window to reflect the current lower-demand regime and avoid adding inventory given high on-hand. Set L to calculated (uses observed lead times = 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent stable regime. This reduces ordering aggressiveness and balances service vs. holding cost given profit=holding=$1/unit.

Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime vs. early samples; current on-hand=809 and in-transit=342 (ample pipeline). I set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=4 from concluded orders. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to center the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (captures recent elevated mean/variance) so the OR backend balances service vs. holding given high inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=974, in-transit=102. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; recent arrivals show demand has fallen since the Mar peak. I select L=default to use promised (and confirmed) 4-period lead time. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples\u2014leveraging full sample stats while honoring the confirmed L=4. This balances service (use confirmed lead time) and holding cost given current high on-hand inventory and recent lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 (2019-05-06): avg demand dropped from 304 (Periods 2019-02-18\u21922019-03-18) to 94 (Periods 2019-05-06\u21922019-05-27), a \u221269% decrease (4-period sustained decline).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Demand regime collapsed at Period 13: recent 5-period mean demand = 87.4 (P13\u2013P17 = 111,107,84,75,60), down sharply from prior growth. On-hand=1016, in-transit=27 \u2014 current inventory is ample vs. the low recent demand; no overdue shipments outstanding (recent arrivals match 4-period lead). Therefore: set L via calculate to use observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new lower-demand regime (1+L multiplier will scale to the review+lead period). This reduces ordering to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service given the sustained lower demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 13 (demands: 111,107,84,75,60,46; mean=80.5). On-hand=970, in-transit=27 \u2014 ample cover now; no new missing shipments. Lead time historically observed = 4 in concluded arrivals (consistent P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To reflect the sustained demand drop, I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 6 periods (captures the post-Period-13 low-demand regime): mu_hat uses recent_N N=6 to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These settings reduce future ordering relative to the earlier high-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given current inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent demand has remained low since the regime drop at Period 13 (recent 6 demands: 107,84,75,60,46,55 \u2192 mean \u224871). On-hand=915, in-transit=27 (ample coverage); shipments since Period 13 show consistent 4-period actual lead time. To avoid excess holding cost versus service, keep L as promised but forecast demand using the recent low regime. Set L=default (promised 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the post-drop mean (lower target inventory). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent reduced volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk while maintaining service given current high on-hand.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized since the Period 13 regime shift (Periods 13\u201320 mean demand \u224872 units/week). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Current on-hand (877) + in-transit (27) = 904 units, which substantially exceeds (1+L)\xd7recent demand ((1+4)\xd772\u2248360). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set L by observed lead times and forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime (last 8 periods). Thus: L=calculate (uses observed lead times), mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to reflect the new low-demand regime, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility. This reduces orders while preserving adequate coverage for the 5-period exposure and prevents further inventory accumulation given holding cost = profit.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 13 (demands P13\u2013P21: 111,107,84,75,60,46,55,38,109 \u2192 avg ~72). On-hand=795, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments expected). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; using calculated L to reflect observed lead times. To align the OR backend with the recent low-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat over the recent regime (N chosen to cover the 9-period low-demand regime) so the base-stock and caps reflect reduced demand and lower variability, lowering holding cost risk while maintaining service.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand regime: after a high early-2019 spike, demand dropped around Period 13 and has been lower but with some variability; on-hand = 408, in-transit = 0 (no overdue shipments). Lead-time evidence (concluded messages) consistently shows 4-period actual lead time. To keep pipeline aligned with observed lead time and recent demand levels, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility to the most recent regime while limiting lookback to recent behavior. This keeps base_stock responsive to current lower/variable demand and avoids unnecessary ordering given high on-hand inventory and equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5 \u2192 moderate service target).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Historical concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead time = 4 (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). On-hand=244, in-transit=74; recent demand shows an uptick since Period 21 (109,165,222,164). To balance service vs holding cost I keep lead time inferred from concludes and use a recent demand window to capture the recent uptick while limiting noise. Selected L by calculating observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use a recent_N window (N=8) to reflect the most recent regime without overfitting short blips.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand (Periods 21\u201325: 109,165,222,164,170; avg=166) shows a sustained uptick versus the prior low regime (~94). On-hand=74 + in-transit=293 = 367 units, which is well below (1+L)-period demand if using a recent mean. Use L=default (promised 4) since concluded history consistently confirms 4-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the recent higher-demand regime and keep pipeline aligned with 5-period demand while controlling holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick confirmed: Periods 21\u201325 (2019-07-01\u21922019-07-29) avg=166 vs prior avg=94 (+76%), sustained for 5 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has upticked vs earlier trough (Periods 21\u201326 showing higher weekly sales, recent 5-week window elevated). On-hand=0, in-transit=525 (covers part of upcoming demand but arrival visibility delayed). Promised lead time is 4 and historical concludes confirm LT=4; use promised LT. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the recent higher-demand regime (N=5) so the OR engine targets a 5-period cover (1+L) based on the latest regime rather than long-run mean, balancing stockouts vs holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=779. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple Pn\u2192Pn+4 arrivals). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 21 (recent 7 periods P21\u2013P27 show elevated demand vs earlier trough). To capture recent demand while accounting for confirmed L=4 and current pipeline, I set L via calculate (use observed lead times), use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on the last 7 samples, and recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward current higher-demand regime while the OR backend caps orders; it balances service against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has risen vs earlier low regime: last 5 periods (P24\u2013P28) demands = [164,170,242,294,200] (avg \u2248234). On-hand=0, in-transit=902 (large pipeline). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded P\u2192P+4). I therefore set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the current elevated demand and higher variability while the large in-transit quantity will limit actual orders placed via the backend cap.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has recovered from the low-May regime; last 5 observed demands (Periods 25\u201329) = [170,242,294,200,175], showing a sustained uptick vs prior low regime. On-hand=44, in-transit=851 \u2014 pipeline is large but many arrivals have been observed with consistent 4-period actual lead time. I set L to 'calculate' to record observed lead-time average (confirmed repeatedly as 4). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent higher-demand regime (captures recent surge while avoiding stale low-demand data). This balances service (higher target stock to avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost given a large existing pipeline.

Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently observed as 4 periods; recent demand (Periods 26\u201330 = 242,294,200,175,282) shows a sustained uptick vs earlier low regime. Set L to promised (default) to reflect confirmed LT=4. Forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods (recent_N, N=5) so the base-stock reflects the recent higher demand pattern and the observed variability, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given zero on-hand) against holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date Period 32 (2019-09-16). Historical concludes show consistent observed lead_time = 4 (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use calculated lead time from observations. Recent demand (Periods 27\u201331 = 294, 200, 175, 282, 286) indicates a higher, volatile regime compared with earlier low-demand months; I use a recent_N=5 forecast to capture the current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This choice keeps (1+L)-horizon demand responsive to the current elevated demand while the sigma estimate captures recent volatility, helping the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 28\u201332) elevated and variable (200,175,282,286,249); pipeline (~1016) ~ covers ~4\u20135 weeks but on-hand is zero so risk of stockouts if demand stays high. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed =4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the most recent higher-demand regime (uses last 5 demand samples), so the OR backend will target a base stock sized to recent demand while accounting for observed lead time and recent volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=1024. Historical concludes show a stable actual lead time of 4 periods (many orders observed with W=4). Recent demand has trended high: last 4 realized demands P30\u2013P33 = [282,286,249,482], mean\u2248325, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current high-demand regime. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the observed LT=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the most recent 4 samples, raising target base-stock and variability to avoid stockouts given large in-transit and high recent demand.

Recent demand (Periods 30\u201334: 282, 286, 249, 482, 262) indicates a higher recent mean and elevated volatility versus older data.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=167, in-transit=1238. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Pipeline is large relative to on-hand; aim to reflect recent demand while avoiding excessive new ordering. Set L by calculated average of observed lead times (confirmed =4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime/volatility (Periods 31\u201335) so the OR engine targets current demand level while pipeline supplies most coverage and cap will limit order size.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=332, in-transit=929. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6 etc.). Recent demand (Periods 32\u201336 = 249, 482, 262, 156, 174) is elevated and volatile relative to earlier low regime; I use a short recent window to capture current higher average and variability. Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent 5 demands. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the recent higher demand while keeping risk of overstock limited by using only the recent regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand (Periods 34\u201338) has stabilized ~156\u2013262 with a 5-period mean ~189; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=653 and in-transit=398 provides healthy coverage vs short-term demand but holding cost equals profit so avoid excess stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 41 (2019-11-18). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 observations). On-hand=661, in-transit=237 (pipeline=898). Recent demand (last 9 concluded weeks, Periods 32\u201340) shows a moderate mean (~214/wk) after prior volatility; to target service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding so q=0.5 => neutral z), I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (confirming 4). I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime and variability (captures the post-regime volatility and avoids overweighting older high/low periods). This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of recent demand) against holding cost given high current on-hand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand (Periods 37\u201341) has averaged ~136 units/week but we are entering holiday season (Black Friday week) so short-run behavior matters. On-hand=641 + in-transit=346 gives strong pipeline cover vs recent demand; no new evidence of lead-time drift (observed concludes consistently show 4). I set L to calculate (use observed lead times average=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the OR forecast on the most recent regime and the upcoming holiday cadence. Sigma set recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the latest demand while avoiding overcommitment given high on-hand inventory.

Recent demand is variable with spikes but prior carry-over insights record major regime shifts; no new sustained changepoint detected.
