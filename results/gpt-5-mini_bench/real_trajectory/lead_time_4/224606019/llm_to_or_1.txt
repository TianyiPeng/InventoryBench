Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly demand (5 samples from Jan 2019) shows mean \u224849.2/wk. Using promised lead time and default demand estimates provides a stable initial forecast while we gather arrival evidence. This keeps base-stock anchored to long-run sample mean and avoids overreacting to no-conclude early-period noise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand mean = 49.2 (samples: 41,59,44,49,53). On-hand=0, in-transit=61, prior order (61) has not yet concluded so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different L. Use default demand/volatility scaling so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on full sample set; this lets the OR engine size base-stock to cover the (L+1)-period demand while accounting for profit vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=133 (equals orders from P1+P2). No 'arrived=' conclude entries yet, so actual lead time not confirmed; shipments appear delayed but only 2 periods of delay\u2014insufficient to declare lost/longer LT. Historical weekly demand mean = 49.2 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). Use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimates so OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and default sigma, allowing it to top up pipeline toward a 5-period coverage while respecting the cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent observed weekly demand samples (historic) average ~49.2 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=263 (pipeline large relative to weekly demand). No concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (all arrived=0), but this is not definitive evidence of a changed lead time (no positive arrival confirms). I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=4) to let the OR engine use promised LT while monitoring for conclude messages. Demand forecast uses default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to reflect stable historical mean and avoid overreacting to missing concludes; sigma uses default as well. This balances service level (pipeline is already sizable) against holding cost while we wait for concluded arrivals to confirm any lead-time issues.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=390 which equals sum of orders from Periods 1-4 (61+72+130+127). No arrivals have concluded despite promised L=4 \u2192 persistent delays. To protect service and cover delayed pipeline I set L explicitly longer than promised. Use default demand/volatility (all samples) so backend scales forecast by (1+L) using historical mean (5 samples avg=49.2). This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while sigma default preserves estimated variability.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders from P1-P4 (61,72,130,127) totaling 390 remain in-transit with no concluded arrivals after promised 4 periods \u2192 evidence of extended lead time/delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $999.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=8, in-transit=451; recent concl.: P1 order (61) arrived in P5 => observed lead_time=4. Several orders (from P2-P4) remain in-transit but we now have confirmed evidence of a 4-period actual lead time. I set L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (captures the confirmed 4-period lead time). Demand forecast and uncertainty use 'default' (use all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) because no sustained demand regime shift is evident yet. This keeps base-stock sized to cover (L+1) periods of demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 and on-hand=20 with in-transit=379 (large pipeline from prior orders). Historical weekly demand samples mean=49.2 (5 samples). I choose default lead time (use promised 4) since confirmations match promised; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that accounts for the 5-period review+lead horizon and balances service vs holding given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has risen vs historical sample: historical mean ~49 (samples 41,59,44,49,53) vs recent 3-period mean = (53+60+68)/3 = 60.3. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods (use calculate to reflect observed lead times). On-hand=82 + in-transit=284 provides ample pipeline; nevertheless forecast (1+L) demand should use recent demand regime to avoid understock if elevated demand persists. Methods chosen: L set by calculate (uses observed lead times); mu_hat uses recent_N N=3 to capture the higher recent mean across the review+lead horizon; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to meet service level while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concludes (P5-P8) consistently show orders from P1-P4 arrived after 4 periods \u2192 actual lead time confirmed at 4. On-hand=164, in-transit=157; pipeline appears healthy. I set L via calculate to use observed lead times (average=4). For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all historical samples) to reflect baseline weekly demand from provided samples while covering review+lead period. Volatility uses default to scale sample std by sqrt(1+L). These choices align OR backend with confirmed lead time and keep safety stock calibrated to historical demand variability while avoiding excessive holdings given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Current on-hand=240, in-transit=135. Recent realized demands (P5-P9) ~53, overall historical sample mean ~49.2. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. To keep service high given profit/holding (profit=$19, hold=$1 -> high critical ratio), set lead time by calculation (uses observed lead times=4). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service vs holding under confirmed LT=4 and avoids overfitting to short-term noise.

Demand history shows moderate weekly demand; profit $19 vs holding $1 implies a high service target. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4; use default demand estimates ((1+L)*mean of all samples) and default volatility so backend computes base-stock and cap consistent with its statistical routine.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). On-hand=91, in-transit=203 => pipeline = 294 units. Demand history (12 periods) shows no sustained regime shift (one large spike at P12 but not persistent). Therefore use calculated lead time to reflect observed confirmations and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend uses full sample mean/variance over (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (observed L=4) against holding cost without overfitting a single large recent spike.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=82, in-transit=211. Historical concluded lead times repeatedly confirm 4 periods; pipeline looks healthy. Demand has shown variability but no sustained recent regime shift requiring ad-hoc forecasting. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand stats so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=50, in-transit=287. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 observations). Recent demand (Periods 10-14) is materially higher than the historical sample mean. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (reflects confirmed L=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand periods: P10-P14) to capture the elevated demand regime and recent volatility, so the OR engine will raise base stock to preserve service while the capped order limits control ordering magnitude.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 10-14: historical mean=49.2 (samples 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04); recent mean (P10-P14)=72.4 (+47.1%), sustained over 5 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=23, in-transit=383. Historical data and conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1->P5,...P11->P15 confirmations). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 10 (P10-P14 mean=72.4 vs historical mean=49.2, sustained 5 periods). To reflect confirmed lead time I select L by 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times = 4). To capture the higher recent demand I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses periods 10-14 recent regime). Volatility likely changed with the regime; use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent std. These choices ensure the OR engine raises base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new higher demand while using recent volatility to set safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=22, in-transit=425. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded P1->P5...P12->P16). Demand regime increased starting Period 10 (P10-P14 mean=72.4, sustained 5 periods) vs historical mean=49.2. To capture the confirmed LT=4 I use calculated lead time; to reflect the recent higher demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses the 5-period elevated regime), so the OR backend will raise the base-stock to cover higher demand while accounting for observed variability.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Historical demand shows a sustained upward regime around Periods 10-14 (mean 72.4 vs historical 49.2). Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 repeatedly. On-hand=98, in-transit=354 provides large pipeline. I select L=calculate to lock in the empirically observed lead time (avg observed =4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the identified regime (Periods 10-14) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demand samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while sigma from recent data keeps safety stock aligned with current variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and higher profit ($19).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (consistent arrivals P1->P5 ... P14->P18). On-hand=173, in-transit=241 \u2014 pipeline adequate but demand has shown regime shifts in earlier windows; more recent 5-period demand (P14\u2013P18 = 69,57,37,32,38) averages lower. I choose L=default to use promised/confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to let the OR engine target the last short-term demand regime; sigma_hat=default to use overall historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (capture recent demand pattern) against holding cost given sizeable on-hand + in-transit.

I set L=calculate to reflect the observed average lead time (confirmed=4). Demand has a past regime shift (P10-P14) but the most recent 5 periods (P15-P19 demands = 57,37,32,38,96) show higher variance and a recent spike; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the latest mean over the review+lead window and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices keep base stock responsive to recent demand while using observed lead time to avoid under-ordering given delayed arrivals.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; promised L=4 is appropriate. Pipeline looks healthy (no outstanding overdue shipments). To capture the higher recent demand regime while keeping responsiveness, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend base-stock and cap reflect the elevated recent mean/volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=69, in-transit=333 (total pipeline=402) \u2014 ample cover vs. recent demand. Historical concluded messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. A previous demand regime shift (P10\u2013P14) exists in the record but recent demand since P15 is mixed and not a sustained new regime. Therefore set L by calculating average observed lead times (reflecting repeated confirmations of 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level given confirmed L and avoids overfitting to short-term spikes while pipeline is large.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; on-hand=119, in-transit=230. Demand regime increased around Periods 10-14 (recent mean \u224872.4 vs historical mean \u224849.2, sustained 5 periods). To capture the higher recent demand I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock reflects the elevated regime over the review+lead window. I keep L=default (promised=4) because concluded history supports promised lead time; using recent_N helps the backend raise target stock to avoid stockouts while controlling holding cost via the capped ordering cap.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=196, in-transit=117. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1->P5...P22->P26 confirms). Recent demand (Periods 20-26 = 82,80,53,39,34,56,36) suggests a moderate elevated mean vs early-2019 baseline but no new sustained regime change. I set L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 (last 7 demand samples) so the forecast and volatility reflect the most recent demand pattern and reduce risk of overstock from older higher spikes. This balances service (capture recent higher average) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent history shows observed lead times consistently = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals P5..P27 confirming L=4). On-hand=241, in-transit=75; pipeline + on-hand is ample vs. recent weekly demands (historical sample mean ~49). To be conservative and aligned with confirmed observations, set lead time method to calculate (use observed lead-times). No strong, new demand regime change since prior insight; use default demand/volatility estimators so OR backend applies full-sample statistics across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (use confirmed L=4) and holding cost by letting backend compute base-stock from global mean/variance.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=226, in-transit=114 (pipeline=340) \u2014 ample coverage vs recent demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (many P->P+4 confirmations). Demand earlier showed a shift up around P10\u2013P14, but the most recent 5 periods (P24\u2013P28 demands = 34,56,36,30,54) average ~42, indicating demand has moderated. To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand and recent lower demand, keep L = promised (4) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods to adapt quickly. Use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect short-term volatility. These choices reduce order quantities relative to full-historical averages and help the OR engine cap orders appropriately given current pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Observed steady actual lead time = 4 periods across many concluded arrivals; on-hand=146, in-transit=111 (total pipeline=257) which comfortably covers near-term demand. Recent demand (Periods 25-29 = 56,36,30,54,83) has mean 51.8; I use a recent_N=5 forecast to capture current regime rather than older winter samples. Choose L='calculate' to reflect observed lead-time history (avg=4). sigma_hat kept as 'default' to use full-sample volatility for safety against sporadic spikes. These settings aim to balance service (using recent demand) vs holding cost given already-large inventory pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=86, in-transit=206. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 periods (many P->P+4 observations). Recent demand regime (Periods 10-14) showed sustained lift; to capture the recent higher demand I use a recent_N forecast for mean and volatility. Choices: L -> calculate (use observed lead times; confirmed =4); mu_hat -> recent_N N=5 (use last 5 demand samples to reflect the sustained higher regime); sigma_hat -> recent_N N=5 (volatility from same recent window). These parameters bias base-stock upward to cover (1+L) periods of the newer higher demand while preserving tighter variance estimate for ordering cap and holding-cost tradeoff.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods across many observations; demand has been above the historical baseline (past months average ~55-80). I set L=calculate to let backend confirm observed lead time average (matches promised 4). For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest demand regime (focus on most recent 5 weeks to reflect the sustained higher demand vs the 2019-Jan baseline). sigma_hat=default to let backend compute volatility using all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (use recent demand average over the review+lead horizon) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory (222) and moderate on-hand (54): relying on recent demand reduces stockout risk while default volatility avoids overreacting to short-term noise.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to match volatility to recent data.

I use calculate for L to let the backend compute the observed average lead time (evidence-heavy = 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default (use all samples) because recent demand shows no new sustained regime shift beyond the previously recorded short spike; defaults balance service level versus holding cost given large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=2, in-transit=301. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 observations), and earlier analysis identified a sustained demand regime shift (recent mean \u224872.4 vs historical \u224849.2). Reconcile: pipeline (301) plus 2 on-hand covers upcoming demand, but we must keep forecasts aligned to the higher recent demand. Set L by 'calculate' to use observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 4). Set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to target the recent higher-demand regime (captures the +47% uplift). Set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts given sustained higher demand while keeping variance and holding-cost tradeoffs explicit to the OR engine.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent weekly demand elevated vs early-sample baseline; last 5 demands (P32-P36)=50,60,92,72,67 (mean=68.2). On-hand 35 + in-transit 295 = 330 units in pipeline. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods \u2014 use calculated lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and short-term volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5). This targets (1+L)-period demand based on the current regime and lets the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given the higher recent mean.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Actual lead time has repeatedly been 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand (Periods 30-37) averages ~66.9, higher than historical mean (49.2) and consistent with earlier detected regime uplift. To reflect the sustained higher recent demand and keep service levels while avoiding excess holding, set L to default (promised=4) and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the last 8 periods (Periods 30-37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/04 (Period 39). On-hand=48, in-transit=291. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 observations). Demand shows elevated recent variability vs original 2019-Jan baseline; using the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods 34-38) captures the current regime and short-term volatility. Choose L by 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=4 from history. Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands, and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability; this balances service level (protect against recent higher demand) while avoiding excessive holding given low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Current on-hand=101, in-transit=282. Recent demand shows variability; to react to the most recent regime I use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 demand samples) to set forecast over review+lead. L uses promised/default=4 to match observed stability. sigma_hat also uses recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility and avoid overstock from older high-mean periods. This keeps base_stock responsive to recent demand while accounting for the 4-period pipeline and current large in-transit buffer.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=166, in-transit=188 (total pipeline=354). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand regime (Periods 10-14) increased vs historical; to be responsive to higher recent demand while capping inventory risk, I set L by observed average lead time and use a short recent window for demand estimates. Choices: L='calculate' to lock in observed LT=4; mu_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to capture the confirmed higher recent mean while keeping responsiveness; sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon using recent demand evidence, improving service rate while limiting holding cost exposure given current healthy pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Current on-hand=197, in-transit=119 (sufficient pipeline). Historical concluded lead times consistently equal 4 periods (many P->P+4 observations); no recent evidence of a different lead time. Recent demand (periods 37-41) averages ~40/week, below early-sample mean, but no sustained new regime since prior recorded shift. Given confirmed LT=4, use calculate for L to lock actual observed average (4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service level vs holding cost without overfitting to short-term noise. This keeps orders conservative given healthy on-hand+pipeline and moderate holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). On-hand=112 + in-transit=137 => pipeline=249 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at moderate demand but we must remain responsive to recent demand variability (notably a spike in Period 42). I set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets base stock using the most recent demand regime and volatility (captures recent spike and short-term variability) rather than the older 2019-Jan baseline. This balances high profit vs low holding cost by focusing safety stock on recent demand uncertainty while acknowledging confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=114, in-transit=198. Historical base mean (Jan-Feb) ~49.2 but multiple sustained higher-demand periods were observed earlier; recent weeks show volatility including large spikes (e.g., 135 at P42). Promised lead time is 4 and concluded history consistently confirms 4-period arrivals. I keep L as default (promised=4). To capture recent upward demand trends while smoothing spikes I use an EWMA for mu_hat with gamma=0.3. I leave sigma_hat as default to let backend scale volatility across the (1+L) horizon from full-sample std. This balances service level (capture recent demand lift) against holding cost given substantial on-hand + in-transit inventory.

Historical data show a sustained demand regime shift earlier (Periods 10-14) to higher mean; to be responsive to that higher recent demand while avoiding excess safety stock given large pipeline, I keep promised lead time and variability defaults but use a recent-window demand estimate. L set to default (promised 4). mu_hat uses recent_N=5 to target the most recent elevated regime without over-weighting older low-demand samples. sigma_hat left as default to reflect long-run demand volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

In-transit 411 likely covers multiple weeks of demand but arrivals are only visible after conclude messages. Use default demand and volatility scaling so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (keeps forecast anchored to historical base while honoring confirmed L=4). This balances high service target (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95) with holding costs by letting OR engine compute safety stock from historical variance.

Actual lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 periods. To protect service while limiting holding cost, keep L at default (promised=4). Use recent_N for demand to reflect the higher recent regime (N=5 capturing the confirmed higher-demand window) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to the new regime and adjusts safety stock for observed volatility.
