Mean \u224849.2 units/week, moderate variability (range 41\u201359). No sustained shift detected. c) Lead time / missing orders: Promised lead time = 4 periods. No prior orders placed, no concluded arrivals to infer an actual lead time; assume promised 4 for planning and allow safety. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With lead time L=4, current decision must cover demand for current period plus next L periods => (L+1)=5 periods. e) Final order logic: Use mean demand \u224849.2 \xd7 5 = 246 units to cover the 5-period exposure. Given demand variance and low holding cost relative to profit (Profit=$19, Holding=$1), add modest safety stock (~10%) \u2192 target \u2248270 units.
