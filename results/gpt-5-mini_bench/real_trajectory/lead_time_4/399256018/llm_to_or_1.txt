Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a clear upward trend across the 5 available samples (72,81,87,104,149), on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods of demand. Use promised lead time (default L=4) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different actual lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N over the last 5 samples to capture the sustained increase (N=5). Volatility use default to let backend scale by \u221a(1+L). This balances higher target stocking for rising demand while relying on backend cap to limit order size given equal profit and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand rising over 2019-01-07..2019-02-04: samples 72,81,87,104,149 (mean=98.6), recent peak 149 on 2019-02-04 (+107% vs 2019-01-07).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (Period 1 order ordered=149 arrived=0). No concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unobserved. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show a rising demand trend (mean=98.6) but only 5 points. To be conservative given limited lead-time evidence and an outstanding in-transit shipment, use promised lead time and the backend's default demand aggregation: L=default (promised L=4), mu_hat=default to compute (1+L)*mean over all samples capturing the recent upward mean, and sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps the OR engine anchored to observed data while the outstanding shipment and future concluded arrivals reveal any lead-time anomalies.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=343; two concluded periods show large demand (195,179) but only 2 periods of elevated demand\u2014insufficient (needs \u22653) to confirm a sustained regime shift or lost shipments. Promised lead time remains appropriate given no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. I therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine uses the full historical sample mean/std (conservative until a 3+ period signal appears). This balances service vs. holding cost by not over-reacting to a short spike while pipeline inventory is already large.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=550; no concluded arrivals in history (all prior ordered arrivals show 0), so cannot confirm a lead-time change\u2014use promised lead time. Demand has risen for 3 consecutive concluded periods (Period1..3 demands 195,179,119; recent avg=164.33 vs historical sample mean=98.6). I set L=default to keep promised lead time, use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime over the last 3 periods, and sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect increased short-term volatility. This raises target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon using recent demand evidence while avoiding assuming lost shipments prematurely. On-hand + in-transit (550) appears large relative to recent 5-period demand (~(1+L)*164.33) but may include delayed arrivals; parameters prioritize matching service to the confirmed higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3 (2019-02-11..2019-02-25): recent avg demand=164.33 vs prior sample mean=98.6 (+66.7%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=781. Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 none of the orders are past their promised arrival visibility, so do not infer a lead-time change. Recent realized weekly demand (from conclude messages) = [195,179,119,96] \u2014 higher and more variable than the early 2019 sample set. To capture the recent demand regime while remaining responsive to the observed decline in the last two weeks, I use recent_N for demand parameters based on the last 4 observed periods (regime_length=4 -> N=4). Keep L as default (promised) so the OR engine plans across the 1+L review+lead horizon. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock calculation on the most relevant recent demand pattern, balancing higher recent demand vs holding cost given profit=holding. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments since arrivals are not yet overdue.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming actual lead time = 4. On-hand=64 and in-transit=632 (large pipeline) \u2014 many units already inbound so avoid over-ordering. Demand history shows a prior upward regime then recent softening (recent concluded demands: 195,179,119,96,85). I set L using calculate to reflect the observed lead time evidence. For demand I use an EWMA (gamma=0.3) to bias the (1+L)-period forecast modestly toward recent lower demand while still respecting prior higher weeks. I keep sigma_hat as default (use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) since pipeline is large and we want the OR backend to cap orders via its cap term, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=157, in-transit=438; two concluded arrivals show observed lead times = 4. High pipeline means we should trust observed lead time average and use a recent demand window to capture the newest regime. Set L by calculating average observed lead times (confirmed 4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent five demand samples (captures recent regime while smoothing older spikes). Use sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility from all samples. This balances service (large pipeline + recent demand) against holding cost (profit=holding so target z*=0; recent_N prevents over-ordering if recent demand fell).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=153, in-transit=231; recent concludes show arrivals on P5,P6,P7 from P1,P2,P3 respectively (observed lead times all =4). No evidence of lost shipments. Demand has jumped recently (most recent demands: 85,101,211) so I bias forecasts to the latest regime. Set L based on observed lead times (calculate). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-variance, rising-demand regime so the backend scales base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level while reflecting increased volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand shows elevated but variable demand (last 4 conclude demands: 85,101,211,144; avg=135.25) and prior analysis confirmed a sustained higher regime earlier. On-hand=240, in-transit=246 (pipeline sizable vs demand). Lead time observations (multiple concluded arrivals) consistently show 4 periods. To balance service vs holding cost: set L based on observed lead times (calculate). Forecast demand using the most recent short regime (recent_N, N=4) to capture the elevated recent mean while avoiding dilution by much older low samples. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to reflect current volatility evidenced by the 211 spike.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent realized demand has been elevated vs early samples (recent demands: P5..P9 = 85,101,211,144,113) and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (orders from P1..P4 arrived after 4). On-hand=127, in-transit=437 (pipeline sizable). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (average observed = 4). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the last 5 demand observations, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has cooled from the early spike; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 6-10) = [101,211,144,113,88], recent mean=131.4. On-hand=39, in-transit=527 (large pipeline covering multiple periods). Lead time has been observed repeatedly as 4 periods in history. To avoid over-ordering given a heavy pipeline but still cover service during lead+review, set L via observed average (calculate). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current regime (last 5 demand periods) so the OR engine computes base-stock for the (1+L)-period demand representative of recent weeks while avoiding stale early-sample bias. This balances service level (cover 5 periods of demand) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=618 (large pipeline from prior orders). Historical concluded lead times = 4 periods (multiple observations P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8) so set L=calculate to let backend confirm average observed lead time. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: 211,144,113,88,89) shows a higher short-term mean than the full-sample average; use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent elevated spikes while the large in-transit stock reduces aggressive ordering risk.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has been variable but no new sustained regime since prior notes; last 5 concluded weekly demands = [144,113,88,89,132] showing a moderate average (~113) vs earlier peak. On-hand=114 + in-transit=399 (total pipeline 513) \u2014 enough to cover several weeks but some arrivals were delayed historically; observed concluded lead times are consistently 4. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the 4-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime and avoid overweighting early-season spikes; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=5) so variability matches the same window. These choices aim to keep base-stock responsive to the recent mean while the calculated L captures confirmed lead-time behavior, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods repeatedly (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P8->P12, P9->P13). On-hand + in-transit = 175 + 261 = 436 units (ample pipeline). Demand has shown variability but the most recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 9\u201313 = 113,88,89,132,130) give a sensible near-term estimate. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period reality; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and adapts to the recent downward/upward mix; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to recent demand while the OR cap limits excessive ordering given holding cost = profit.

Observed lead times from concluded messages are consistently 4 periods. To keep the OR backend responsive to the recent, lower-variance regime I use a recent-N estimate for demand (captures the last weeks) and a recent-N volatility. I set L to calculate so backend confirms actual lead time from observed concludes. This balances service (avoid stockouts) while avoiding excess hold given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has stabilized after earlier rise; last 11 concluded demands (P5..P15) = [85,101,211,144,113,88,89,132,130,106,110], avg ~118. On-hand=140 + in-transit=295 = 435 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at L\u22484. Lead time observations are consistently 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=67, in-transit=428 (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (multiple orders observed arriving 4 periods after order). Recent demand has steadied around ~100\u2013130 units (last several periods: demands 132,130,106,110,100). I set L to calculate to let backend use the observed lead time history (will confirm average \u22484). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent five demand observations (captures recent regime after the earlier spike). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility rather than older higher-variance samples. These choices keep service high (covering lead+review periods) while avoiding over-reacting to older spikes; they also account for the large pipeline to limit new ordering and holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time=4 (orders placed P1..P13 arrived after 4 periods) so use observed lead time. Demand has been elevated vs initial five-sample history but shows no new sustained shift since prior insight; to be responsive to recent actual sales I use a recent-window demand estimate. Choices: L by calculate (average observed lead times = 4); mu_hat by recent_N with N=10 to capture the last 10 demand periods and adapt to current run-rate; sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility over full sample. These parameters keep pipeline coverage aligned with confirmed LT=4 while letting mu_hat reflect recent demand so OR backend balances service level vs holding cost given Profit=Holding cost symmetry.

Recent demand has trended lower in the last 5 concluded periods (demands: 100,79,52,56,29); I choose recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to reflect the lower short-term demand and avoid over-ordering given high on-hand/pipeline. Use default sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices reduce order targets (lower base_stock) and limit holding cost while preserving service via the backend's cap.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=330, in-transit=167. Recent demand has settled below earlier peaks; last 9 concluded demands (Periods 13\u201321) = [130,106,110,100,79,52,56,29,32], mean\u224877.1. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 4 periods (consistent across many observations). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in confirmed LT=4. For demand, I use recent_N with N=9 (captures the post-peak lower regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 9 samples; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (cover (L+1) periods of recent demand) while avoiding overstating demand from the earlier peak, and they account for confirmed lead-time behavior and current pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has settled lower (~30-40 units/week recently) but historical early-2019 sample mean=98.6 used as seed. On-hand=377 and in-transit=101 => ample coverage vs. expected demand; no evidence of new lost shipments (arrivals have consistently concluded at LT=4). Use default lead time to keep promised LT=4 (matches observed). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has settled well below early peak; last 8 concluded demands (Periods 17-24) show a low-demand regime (~30-56/week) and on-hand (391) + in-transit (82) is ample vs weekly demand. Lead time has been consistently observed =4. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in that evidence. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (recent 8 periods) so the backend sizes base-stock and cap to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining service.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=288, in-transit=82. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand history shows recent moderate weekly demand (~29-74 last periods) after earlier peak; with current high on-hand I will not up-weight recent samples. Use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps ordering conservative given large on-hand and avoids adding risk from transient spikes or lost shipments.

Recent demand (Periods ~16\u201327) has settled lower (~30\u201380/week) versus the early spike; no new sustained uptick. I keep L at the promised/confirmed value to match observed arrivals. I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime, using N=12 (captures the most recent ~3 months of weekly demand, meets min 3 and caps). This biases the backend base-stock toward current demand and reduces excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has cooled from early-2019 peaks; last 5 realized weekly demands = [30,29,74,75,85] (Periods 24-28) \u2014 modest mean with noticeable variability. On-hand=210, in-transit=106 (pipeline adequate short-term). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4. I choose L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent regime and capture the recent lower mean while preserving short-term variability; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep target base-stock responsive to the recent downshift in mean demand while the sigma uses recent variability to avoid stockouts given observed demand spikes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has declined from the spring peak and stabilized in the 30\u201385 range (recent demands: 29,74,75,85,45). On-hand =165 and in-transit=106 provide ample coverage vs promised lead time. Historical conclude messages repeatedly show arrivals = ordered after 4 periods, so keep lead time at promised/confirmed value. I select default methods so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service level and holding cost given current ample inventory and holding=$1 ~ profit=$1 (q=0.5). No explicit adjustments for lost shipments or regime shifts\u2014no new sustained changepoint since prior insights.

Recent demand has varied but shows no new sustained regime change since prior insights. To let the OR engine use full historical statistics and the promised lead time, I select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

On-hand=127, in-transit=246 -> healthy pipeline but some recent orders (Period 30 ordered=170) have not yet arrived (arrivals have been consistent at 4-period lead time). Lead time has been observed as 4 repeatedly. I set L via calculate to let backend confirm observed lead time average (matches confirmed 4). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align the (1+L) forecast window with the most recent demand regime, keeping safety stock responsive to the lower recent demand and avoiding excessive holding costs while preserving service given substantial pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent weekly demand has moderated (many weeks in the 30\u201390 range) but historical seed samples show a higher early-2019 mean; on-hand=67, in-transit=246 (pipeline substantial). Observed concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods, so use calculate for L to reflect observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (conservative given limited formal sample set). This balances service (pipeline covers multiple periods) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=4 from concluded history. To capture the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent 12 demand samples to reflect current mean/volatility and avoid overweighting the early high 149 spike. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward recent demand (better service vs holding tradeoff) while relying on confirmed lead-time evidence so pipeline coverage is correct.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Current on-hand=93, in-transit=288. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (use calculate to reflect observed average). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: 86,60,101,80,73) averages ~80 units \u2014 lower than early-year peaks \u2014 so I use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime. This keeps base_stock tuned to current demand while pipeline (288) already provides multi-period cover; using recent estimates reduces overstock risk given equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5, z*=0).

Given profit=holding (q=0.5) the OR base_stock centers on the forecast (no extra safety z*). Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples.

On-hand=10, in-transit=370 (sufficient pipeline for multiple weeks); no recent missing shipments\u2014observed concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. I set L=calculate to use the observed lead-time average (confirmed ~4). To adapt to the recent lower-demand regime and reduce holding, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on the most recent 5 demand samples, keeping orders responsive to current demand and limiting excess inventory given high in-transit stock.

Pipeline+on-hand covers (1+L)=5 periods => avg supply per period \u224863.4, matching recent demand (last months ~60\u201385). Choose L='calculate' to confirm observed lead time=4 from concluded history; mu_hat use recent_N (N=12) to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (~lower summer/fall demand vs earlier spring spike); sigma_hat keep 'default' to let backend compute volatility from full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts given observed lead time) while avoiding excess holding by using recent demand for mean forecast.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=64, in-transit=252. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmations); no evidence of lost shipments. Recent weekly demand has moderated from Sept peaks and settled around ~60-75 in the last 8 weeks (P33..P40 show demand: 101,80,73,71,84,69,63,49 with a downward drift). I use default lead time (promised 4) since observed =4 repeatedly. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to focus the (1+L) forecast on the most recent regime and reduce influence of earlier high peaks. I apply recent_N for sigma_hat with N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep pipeline sizing responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while preserving service given the 4-period lead time and symmetric profit/holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent weekly demand has been ~49\u201386 with no new sustained shift; historical lead time observations consistently show 4 periods. On-hand=124 + in-transit=184 => pipeline=308 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at current demand. I use lead time inferred from observed history (calculate) to keep backend aligned with confirmed LT=4; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses long-run sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts given solid pipeline) against holding cost by not inflating forecast or safety stock unnecessarily.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent weekly demand has settled well below early-2019 peaks; last 5 concluded demands = [69,63,49,61,114] with recent typical ~60-80. Lead time history shows consistent 4-period arrivals (multiple concluded P arrivals); use observed-average lead time. To keep safety inventory aligned to the current lower demand regime, use recent demand samples (N=8) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base-stock on the most recent regime rather than the early high peak. This balances service (prevent stockouts given L\u22484) while avoiding excessive holding cost on slow-turn inventory. No evidence of lost shipments or a new sustained lead-time change beyond the confirmed L=4.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 39-43 = 63,49,61,114,48) best reflects current regime including a one-off spike; to focus the forecast on the most recent behavior use recent_N with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat).

Profit=Holding so service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0) \u2014 target base_stock equals demand forecast \u03bc\u0302. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (4).

Profit=$1 and Holding=$1 imply equal costs (q=0.5); I'll use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and volatility from full history and sets service level via its formula. This avoids overfitting to recent noise around holiday weeks while respecting the confirmed LT=4.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent demand has fallen from an earlier Nov spike (114 on Period 42) to a stable low in the last 5 periods (periods 43-46 demands = 48,47,49,41 plus the 114 outlier). The last 5-week window captures the recent post-spike regime while still including the spike for robustness. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages; no evidence of change. On-hand=137 and in-transit=249 give ample pipeline cover but demand is lower recently, so I reduce forecast sensitivity by using a recent_N estimate over 5 weeks. Choices: L=default to keep promised/confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent lower-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. These settings steer the OR engine toward a lower base stock consistent with current demand while preserving service given confirmed lead time and existing pipeline.
