Why adjust: With promised L=4 we need pipeline+on-hand to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because orders placed now will only arrive after 4 periods. That target = (L+1)*\u03bc\u0304 = 5 * 60.6 = 303 units. OR's capped recommendation (79) is far below the 5-period coverage and would leave us exposed to stockouts when the order arrives. There is no evidence of a lead-time shortening or lost shipments to justify reducing orders, nor any confirmed demand regime shift to justify ordering less. Decision: Order 303 units to bring pipeline + on-hand up to the 5-period demand estimate (base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 = 303).

  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed as 4 periods from carry-over (Period1\u2192Period5 and multiple later confirms). Inventory: on-hand = 200, in-transit = 0. Demand outlook: recent periods (P32\u2013P46) show low steady demand; average over P32\u2013P46 = 200 total /14 periods \u2248 14.3 units/week \u2192 (L+1)=5 period demand \u2248 71.5 units. OR recommended 197 units based on earlier high-demand history and promised lead time; that would create large unnecessary holding cost given current low demand and equal profit/holding cost. Strategy: place no order this period to avoid excess holding cost while on-hand inventory comfortably covers the next (L+1) periods of expected demand. Monitor next concluded periods for any sustained demand increase before ordering.",
