Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no 'conclude' messages observed so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Historical weekly samples (5 points, mean=60.6) available; no evidence of a sustained demand regime shift. Use promised lead time and default demand aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, ensuring orders target coverage of the review+lead horizon while avoiding premature adjustments based on insufficient data.

LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18): recent demand observed 86 in Period 1 vs historical mean ~62 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). No concluded arrivals yet (in-transit=79, ordered P1 arrived=0), so no evidence to change lead time. Use adaptive short-run demand estimate to respond to the uptick while keeping lead time at promised value.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical weekly samples (Jan\u2013Feb) have mean ~60.6; recent concluded demands are elevated (P1=86, P2=85) but only two periods\u2014insufficient to declare a regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=171 (orders 79+92) which is short of (1+L)-period expected demand if L=4 (5\xd7mean\u2248303), so pipeline is likely insufficient but recent upswing is not yet sustained. I will use the promised lead time (default) and keep demand/volatility estimates based on all samples (defaults) so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap consistently while we wait for further arrival/conclude evidence. This balances avoiding premature overstocking against the risk of understock given limited evidence of a sustained demand increase.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand mean = 60.6 (5 samples). Promised lead time = 4. All past orders (P1-P3) have no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 this is expected given promised L=4, so there is no confirmed lead-time change. On-hand=0, in-transit=264 vs (1+L)*mean \u2248303 \u2192 pipeline slightly short. Use default lead time and default demand moments (use all samples) so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap with full-sample estimates and the promised L; this balances service level vs holding cost while we await concluded arrivals to confirm any lead-time or demand regime shifts.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=332. Historical weekly demand samples mean=60.6 (five samples). No concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20134 despite orders placed each period, so actual lead time is unconfirmed; use promised lead time and historical-demand defaults. Choose L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default to let backend set (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps parameters grounded in long-run data while the missing-arrival pattern is monitored.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 have not concluded (arrived=0) despite arrivals expected; 4 consecutive periods of missing arrivals \u2014 possible extended lead time or lost shipments (evidence: P1 ordered=79, P2=92, P3=93, P4=68; all arrived=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand (Periods1-5) = [86,85,56,30,52] shows a higher and variable demand regime vs. older 2019 samples. On-hand=27, in-transit=253; one long-delayed arrival (P1) just concluded, confirming shipments can have 4-period lead time. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture actual behaviour. For demand I use the most recent 5 periods (recent_N, N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the current regime and variability; this balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given narrow profit=holding parity.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 ordered on Period 1 arrived on Period 5, lead_time=4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $119.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=190. Recent concludes show two confirmed arrivals with lead_time=4 (P1->P5, P2->P6) after four-period delays and earlier missing arrivals\u2014evidence supports actual lead time = 4. I select L by calculation (average observed lead times) to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand parameters I use default (whole-sample mean scaled by (1+L) and std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend leverages full historical weekly samples (mean\u224860.6) to produce base-stock covering the (L+1)=5 period review+lead window; this balances service level given long lead time against holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded arrivals (P5: P1 arrived, P6: P2 arrived, P7: P3 arrived) consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=208 (outstanding pipeline covering upcoming arrivals). Given confirmed LT=4 and stable historical weekly demand samples (mean ~60.6), use calculated lead time and default demand/volatility aggregations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances service (use full (1+L) coverage) against holding cost while relying on confirmed LT evidence rather than promised-only assumptions.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (P1 ordered arrived in P5). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=267. Historical sample mean=60.6 units/week; (1+L)*mean = 5*60.6 = 303 expected demand over review+lead. Pipeline (267) < 303 \u2192 modest shortfall. Promised lead time equals observed lead time, so use default lead time. Use default demand/volatility aggregation (all samples) so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean + safety using its loss function; this will raise orders to cover the ~5-period demand while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concludes show actual lead time = 4 periods (P1 arrival seen P5); on-hand=0, in-transit=405 (these are pipeline units arriving in future). Several past orders were delayed but lead time now confirmed at 4. Use promised/confirmed L to keep pipeline coverage aligned with observed arrivals. Select default demand/volatility (use full-sample statistics) because history is limited but stable seasonally; default (1+L)-scaling ensures the OR backend targets (L+1) period coverage and balances service vs holding given Profit=Holding=$1.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P4 and P6 arrived with 4-period lag). Use L="calculate" to lock in observed lead time average. Demand samples provided (Jan weeks) will be used by default forecasting: mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given current ample in-transit inventory and confirmed lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=360 (represents multiple outstanding orders arriving under LT=4). Demand history (samples provided) has mean ~60.6/week; with confirmed L=4, I use the backend's default aggregate forecast to cover review+lead (1+L)=5 periods so mu_hat = 5\xd7mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. I choose L via 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed LT=4 from concluded arrivals. Using defaults keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to historical mean/variance while acknowledging the confirmed 4-period lead time and the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering given holding cost equals profit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent realized demand has jumped sharply since Period 9 (Periods 9-12 demands = 177,181,304,157) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=409. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in concluded history (orders consistently arrived after 4 periods). To react to the sustained higher demand regime I set L to default (promised 4) and use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to base stock on the most recent regime (N=4 covering Periods 9-12). This ensures the OR backend raises target inventory to cover the new higher demand while respecting the known 4-period lead time and limiting exposure to older low-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 9 (2019/4/8): avg demand over Periods 9-12 = 204 vs historical sample avg (2019 Jan) = 60.6 (+237%), sustained for 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13). On-hand=60, in-transit=586. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P9 arrived after 4 periods). Demand regime shift beginning Period 9: recent demands (P9\u2013P13 = 177,181,304,157,78) are materially higher and more variable than the Jan baseline (mean=60.6). To respect observed lead time I use calculated L (average observed = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (covering P9\u2013P13) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new high-variance regime; this lets the OR backend size base stock to meet elevated demand while the recent sigma captures increased uncertainty. Profit and holding cost are equal, so target service level is ~50%; using recent regime stats balances fill rate and holding cost given the shifted demand and confirmed lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand elevated since Period 9 (regime shift); last 6 demands = [177,181,304,157,78,107], mean=167.33/wk. On-hand 0 + in-transit 802 \u2248 802/167.33 = 4.79 review+lead periods coverage (with (1+L)=5, pipeline nearly matches target). Observed lead times consistently 4 periods in concluded messages (strong evidence). I choose L by calculating average observed lead times to let the backend confirm 4. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (uses most recent 6 weeks). For volatility I use recent_N N=6 to reflect current variability. These choices align mu_hat with the sustained higher demand and keep the OR base-stock target near the existing in-transit supply to avoid excessive extra ordering given equal profit and holding costs.

Demand shifted up starting Period 9 (sustained higher demand through Periods 9-15). To reflect the new demand regime, set L by calculate (use observed lead times), set mu_hat using recent_N of the most recent 7 demand samples (Periods 9-15) to capture the regime average across review+lead, and set sigma_hat using recent_N N=7 to capture recent volatility. This keeps the OR base-stock informed by the higher recent mean while using recent volatility to size safety stock; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3). On-hand=0, in-transit=634. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P12 arrived after 4 periods). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 9 (sustained higher weekly demand through Periods 9\u201316). I choose L='calculate' to reinforce observed lead time=4 from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 9\u201316) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing (1+L)*mean. Sigma set recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These settings ensure the OR backend targets base-stock sized to the elevated recent demand while using confirmed lead-time evidence; large in-transit volume (634) will be accounted for by the pipeline when computing orders.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 9 (avg demand P9\u2013P12 = 204 vs historical Jan avg ~60.6). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed arrivals P1\u2192P5 etc.). Current position: on-hand=139, in-transit=525 (large pipeline). To reflect confirmed LT and the new, higher demand regime I set L by observed average (calculate). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (N=9 covering Periods 9\u201317) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and volatility. These choices tell the OR engine to size base stock for the longer/higher-demand regime while the large in-transit volume will cap new orders via the backend cap, avoiding excess ordering.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 9 (avg much higher vs Jan baseline); actual lead time has been confirmed at 4 in concluded history. Current inventory: on-hand=253, in-transit=455 (total pipeline=708) which covers many periods of elevated demand. Profit=1 and holding=1 imply service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0), so base_stock will equal mu_hat; to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 10 demand observations (regime length P9\u2013P18 = 10) for both mean and volatility. I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because concluded messages consistently show 4-period arrivals. Using recent_N N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat aligns the backend forecast with the new higher-demand regime while the large current pipeline reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=128 and in-transit=541 provide substantial pipeline cover. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmed 4).

Demand regime shifted up starting Period 9 and has persisted; use recent data from that high-demand regime to forecast. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (regime length from P9\u2013P21 =13) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the sustained higher-demand regime, balancing service level needs against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=76, in-transit=637. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods since Period 5 (multiple concluded arrivals show orders placed at Pn arriving at Pn+4). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 9 (avg Periods 9-12 \u2248204 vs historical Jan avg \u224860.6), and high demand has persisted through Period 22. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead time (\u22484).

Current on-hand=61, in-transit=624 (ample pipeline). I set L to default (promised lead time=4) since concluded history confirms LT=4. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (regime from Period 9 through current \u2192 15 recent periods) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the post-change regime data. This keeps service levels aligned to the sustained higher demand while avoiding overstating uncertainty given strong recent sample size.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Historical data and conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 9 (avg demand ~204 vs historical ~60.6). Current inventory: on-hand=89, in-transit=594 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to demand. I choose L='calculate' to lock in observed lead time (4). For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (regime from Period 9\u201324, 16 samples) so mu_hat reflects the elevated demand (backend will scale by 1+L). sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=16 to capture recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend bases base_stock on the new high-demand regime while recognizing confirmed lead time; with profit=holding (q=0.5) the z* term is zero so aligning mu_hat to recent demand keeps service without excessive extra safety stock given large pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 9 (avg Periods 9-12 \u2248204 vs Jan baseline \u224860.6). On-hand=139, in-transit=549 \u2014 pipeline is large. Observed concluded lead times have consistently been 4 periods, so use calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the sustained higher mean/variance: regime length \u224817 periods (P9\u2013P25), so N=17. This increases mu_hat to reflect elevated demand and sigma_hat to reflect higher volatility, helping the OR engine raise base stock to avoid stockouts while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 9 (sustained higher weekly demand vs Jan samples). On-hand=258 + in-transit=453 = 711 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected elevated demand given promised lead time. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so I use the promised/default L. To capture the post-Period-9 demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime samples (N=18, periods 9\u201326) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the elevated demand pattern. This balances service (avoid stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent inventory strong: on-hand 293 + in-transit 399 = 692 units. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 9 (avg \u2248204) but demand has softened in the most recent weeks (Periods 24-27 demands = 129,113,77,73). Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods historically. To balance service vs holding cost I keep promised lead time (use default=4), but estimate demand using recent data to react to the recent downshift: use recent_N over the last 12 demand samples to form (1+L)*mean and volatility over same window. This reduces exposure to stale high-demand months while still capturing the elevated regime vs Jan-baseline. sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility for the OR engine's safety stock calculation.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 9 (avg demand much higher than Jan baseline). On-hand=338, in-transit=286 \u2014 ample coverage but we must keep the OR backend aware of the higher recent demand. I set L to use observed lead times (calculate). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 9\u201328, regime_length=20), so the backend will size base-stock and cap using the elevated recent mean and variance, balancing service level versus holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 9 (avg ~204 vs historical ~60); observed lead times consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand=396 + in-transit=271 = 667 units, which covers multiple weeks of elevated demand (1+L periods). Set L by calculate to lock in observed lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (20 most recent periods of the regime), so the OR backend sizes base-stock for the current higher mean and volatility while respecting pipeline inventory and the cap.

On-hand=463 and in-transit=202 provide ample coverage short-term. Promised lead time=4 periods is consistently observed in concluded history, so keep L default. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=20 (regime length >20, cap=20) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the latest 20 observations, improving service while avoiding excess holding given current high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). On-hand=499, in-transit=148; confirmed historical actual lead time = 4. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 9 (sustained higher weekly demand since). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and provide the OR engine with recent demand stats, keep L as promised (default=4) and use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (20 = cap on regime length since Period 9). This biases forecast to the elevated demand while limiting noise from older low-demand January samples. The larger recent sample for sigma captures current volatility; parameters aim to raise base-stock to meet higher demand while avoiding excessive overstock given equal profit and holding costs.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods since early history, and a sustained demand regime shift began at Period 9 (avg demand \u2248204 vs historical \u224860.6). To reflect the higher, sustained post-changepoint demand I use a recent_N demand estimate over the most recent regime. This sets L to the promised/default (4) and uses recent_N (N=20, capped) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the new higher mean while capturing recent volatility; this reduces stockouts given the confirmed higher demand while avoiding over-reacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=571, in-transit=31. Historical Jan samples avg\u224860.6 and a demand regime shift occurred in Apr (Periods 9\u201312) with much higher demand, but demand over the most recent 5 periods (Periods 29\u201333 = 60,33,18,16,29) has settled much lower (mean\u224831.2) for 5 periods. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (matches promised). No overdue or lost shipments currently visible. I set L to default (promised 4) since concluded history confirms lead time=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent low-demand regime (N chosen = recent regime length =5). This keeps the backend base-stock tied to the current low demand, reducing holding cost while preserving service for observed demand levels.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=582, in-transit=0. Historical log confirms actual lead time = 4. Recent realized demand (Periods 30-34 = 33,18,16,29,20) is much lower than the earlier high-regime spike; I therefore base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks to avoid overstocking. Chosen L default (promised=4, confirmed in history). mu_hat recent_N uses last 5 samples to reflect current low demand; sigma_hat recent_N uses last 5 samples to capture recent variability. This reduces base-stock and cap, limiting new receipts that would raise holding cost given holding cost equals profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=567, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4; there is a prior sustained demand regime shift (Periods 9\u201312) already recorded. Current inventory is ample so priority is to avoid additional holding cost; use promised lead time and population defaults so backend's base-stock calculation relies on full-sample demand statistics (conservative given high on-hand). No evidence of new sustained lead-time or demand change in the last periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=540, in-transit=0. Historical lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods; no recent evidence of further change. Demand has fallen back to low levels over the last several weeks (recent demands: 29,20,15,12,15), so I base forecasts on the most recent regime. I set L=default (promised 4). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps target inventory aligned to current low demand and avoids unnecessary holding cost given large on-hand stock and zero in-transit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=533, in-transit=0. Historical series shows a large demand regime shift in Apr\u2013May, but recent 4 weeks (Periods 35-38) show low demand (15,12,15,7) indicating current low-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To avoid overstock risk given high on-hand and low recent demand, set L to default (promised 4). Forecast demand using a recent_N estimate over the most recent 4 samples to capture the current low regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N over the same 4 samples to reflect recent volatility. This reduces ordering intensity versus using the earlier high-demand regime and limits holding cost exposure while preserving service for near-term demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=516, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=4 and historical concludes consistently show actual LT=4. Recent demand has dropped sharply since Period 35 (last 5 demands: 15,12,15,7,17 \u2192 mean\u224813.2), so short-term forecast should use the most recent low-demand regime. To avoid excess holding cost (holding=$1 equals profit=$1 so service quantile q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), use recent demand statistics over the immediate low-demand regime. Selected L=default to trust promised/confirmed LT=4. Selected mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to compute (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples, capturing the sustained low-demand regime. Selected sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This keeps base-stock conservative to reduce holding costs while covering expected demand over the review+lead period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: avg demand over Periods 35-39 = 13.2 vs prior regime avg (Periods 9-12) = 204 (+/- large drop, -93%), sustained for 5 periods

Lead time previously confirmed as 4; no new evidence to change. To avoid overstocking, keep promised lead time (default) and base forecast on the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (the length of the low-demand regime) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant samples, reducing orders while reflecting current variability.

Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in history. To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand and sustained low demand, I select L=default to keep promised lead time, mu_hat=recent_N using the most recent low-demand regime (N=8 periods, Periods 35\u201342) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=8) to capture recent low variance.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand = 467, in-transit = 0; promised lead time = 4 and concluded history consistently shows lead_time=4. To avoid overstock given holding cost equals profit (q=0.5), I use an L inferred from observed concludes and recent demand statistics. Set L by calculate (uses observed lead times = 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (the length of the low-demand regime, capped rules applied) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the most recent 9 demands. This yields lower target base stock aligned with the sustained low-demand regime and reduces holding cost risk while preserving service for L+1 periods.

Keep L at promised lead time (use default=4) because observed concluded lead times historically equal 4 and there is no new confirmed lead-time change. Use recent_N for demand forecast and volatility to capture the current low-demand regime; choose N=12 (regime length P35\u2013P46 = 12) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 12) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 12). These parameters reduce over-ordering versus using the full historical (high-demand) sample and balance service level versus holding cost given high on-hand inventory.
