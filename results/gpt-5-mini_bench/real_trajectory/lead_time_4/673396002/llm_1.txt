Five-week average = ~284 units/week; recent weeks show volatility but no sustained new regime (not enough periods to call a shift). c) Lead time & missing orders: Promised lead time = 4 periods. No concluded arrivals observed yet, and no in-transit inventory\u2014cannot confirm actual lead time; assume promised LT=4 for planning. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With LT=4, need coverage for L+1 = 5 periods of demand because orders placed now arrive after demand for current period. e) Order logic: Use 5-period coverage \xd7 demand forecast. Use the 5-week historical average (~284/week) as the demand forecast (conservative given volatility). Order = 5 \xd7 284 = 1420 units. This balances aiming to meet demand across the lead time while avoiding extreme overstock given high holding cost.",

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (Xmas week) \u2014 apparel/accessories often see a holiday spike. Recent demand: P43\u2013P45 = 93,129,216 with a strong uptick in P45 (216). Historical lead time: confirmed 4 periods (several orders observed arriving after 4). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=314, in-transit=0. Decision rule: must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after decision). Forecast a holiday-elevated weekly demand \u2248200 units (conservative midpoint between recent 129 and spike 216, allowing for Xmas uplift). 5-period demand \u22481,000 units; current on-hand covers 314 \u2192 shortfall \u2248686. Given equal profit and holding cost ($1), avoid extreme overstock but ensure service through arrival. Place an order to cover the shortfall and round to a practical lot: 700 units.",

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, New Year week) \u2014 demand elevated in Dec but likely tapering after peak. Lead time: historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple observed P1->P5, P15->P19, etc.). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=117, in-transit=700 (order placed P46), total available=817. Recent demand (P43\u2013P46) = [93,129,216,197], avg \u2248159/week. Decision timing: orders placed now would arrive in P51 (4-period promised lead time). Need to cover current + next 4 periods of demand (L+1=5 periods). Forecast 5-period demand \u2248159*5\u2248795, which is approximately covered by current on-hand + in-transit (817). Given profit=$1/unit and holding cost=$1/unit/period, extra inventory quickly erodes reward. No evidence of sustained regime shift starting after P31 that would require extra safety stock. Therefore place no new order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs while pipeline already covers expected demand.",
