  "rationale": "Lead time: confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history (matches carry-over insight). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=164 (Period 46 order). Demand: recent weeks volatile with large spikes (P43\u2013P46 = 47,12,125,92) but no new 3+ period sustained regime shift since prior carry-over insights; prior sustained shifts already recorded. OR baseline: recommends 161 using promised L=4 and historical demand; that aligns with our confirmed lead time and provides reasonable replenishment without overcommitment given high recent volatility and equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5 \u2192 low safety stock). Action rationale: keep OR's capped recommendation (161) \u2014 it top-ups pipeline to cover expected demand over lead+review while avoiding excessive holding cost if the recent spike is short-lived. No new carry-over insight (insufficient sustained evidence over 3+ periods).",
