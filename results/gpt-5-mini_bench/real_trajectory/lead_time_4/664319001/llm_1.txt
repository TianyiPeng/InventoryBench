Demand regime: Recent periods show low post-Period-36 regime (avg ~11\u201347 recent spikes P42=36,P43=47,P44=12) \u2014 not enough evidence (needs \u22653 sustained periods) to declare a new higher regime. Lead time / pipeline: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded history; in-transit=0 and no recent arrivals pending. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 243 units, holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit/unit = $1 \u2014 excess inventory is costly. Forecast & order logic: Expected weekly demand likely << on-hand (even using conservative elevated holiday estimate), so no replenishment required now to avoid high holding costs and potential leftover units. Final: place no order this period.",
