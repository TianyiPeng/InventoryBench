Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals observed; promised lead time is 4 periods but no evidence to change it. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~63 units/week. To satisfy (L+1) demand coverage and avoid premature changes with only 5 samples, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (cover 5 periods) vs holding cost given limited data and no confirmed lead-time shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=96 (ordered Period 1) and no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean demand \u224863/week. Promised lead time is 4; use default lead time and default demand summaries so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This avoids premature adjustments given no sustained changepoint or confirmed delays; it balances service-level needs (covering review+lead demand) against holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded periods show demands of 43 (P1) and 118 (P2) and two outstanding orders (96, 92) have not yet concluded \u2014 but no concluded arrivals exist, so there is insufficient evidence to infer a lead-time different from the promised 4. Historical sample mean (provided) = 63/wk; with promised L=4 the default (1+L)\xd7mean = 315 units covers five periods. Pipeline (in-transit=188) + on-hand=0 is currently below that 5-period expected demand (188<315), indicating we are under-pipelineed if demand matches historical mean. I therefore use default methods: keep promised lead time (L=default) and let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples. This avoids overfitting to two recent periods and lets the backend apply the capped ordering logic given the stated statistics and costs.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=303 (orders P1-3 = 96+92+115). Promised L=4 and none of those orders have concluded yet; not overdue given promised lead time, so use default L to avoid mis-inference. Recent demand (Periods 1-3) = [43,118,84], mean \u224881.7 which is above the older sample mean (~63); I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this upward shift. Volatility should reflect recent variability, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3. These choices raise target base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while keeping lead time as promised because there is no concluded evidence of lead-time change.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows four consecutive orders (P1-P4) with arrived=0 \u2192 strong evidence of missing/delayed shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=447 but none have concluded; to be conservative, set lead time explicitly longer than promised so OR orders more safety stock. Chosen L: explicit to reflect extended/uncertain delivery. Chosen mu_hat and sigma_hat: default (use all historical samples) so backend scales demand by (1+L) and uses full-sample variability; this balances higher service target given suspected shipment issues while avoiding overfitting to short recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-4 (ordered=96,92,115,144) have arrived=0 in concludes \u2014 suggests shipments delayed or lost; treat effective lead time as extended until arrivals conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $844.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Historical weekly demand samples (85,71,74,49,36) show a baseline mean ~63. On-hand=49, in-transit=463; note arrivals: Period 5 conclude shows Period 1 order (96) arrived with lead_time=4, while orders from Periods 2-4 (92,115,144) remain unarrived \u2014 possible lost/delayed shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed 4). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (covering current + L future periods) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5); Missing shipments remain: orders from Periods 2-4 (ordered=92,115,144) have not arrived.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concludes show orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 arrived with lead_time=4; orders from Periods 3-4 remain outstanding. On-hand=92, in-transit=371 \u2192 pipeline=463, which comfortably covers multiple periods of demand. I set L=calculate to have the backend use observed average lead time (evidence: Period5 concluded P1 arrival lead_time=4; Period6 concluded P2 arrival lead_time=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent six observed weekly demands (Periods 1\u20136: 43,118,84,69,47,49) so the forecast reflects recent higher variability vs. the older Jan samples. Sigma_hat uses default to let backend compute volatility from full sample scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices keep service high given delayed shipments while controlling holding cost by relying on recent demand data and confirmed lead-time behavior.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-3 arrived with lead_time=4, so actual lead time confirmed at 4. On-hand=148 + in-transit=256 provides ample pipeline; no overdue/lost shipments newly evident. Use observed lead time (calculate) to reflect confirmed L=4. For demand, historical sample mean (5 weekly samples) and no sustained demand regime shift detected \u2192 use default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These choices keep the OR backend anchored to the confirmed lead time while balancing service level (through base-stock driven by historical mean) against holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P4 all arrived with W=4). On-hand=171, in-transit=120 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers demand but demand has been variable (recent weekly demands: 47,49,59,121). No sustained demand regime change detected (spike at 121 is one-off). I therefore use lead-time estimated from observed data and default demand/volatility aggregators so the OR backend uses full sample history: L set to calculate (average observed lead times = 4), mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, and sigma_hat default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service level (use observed lead time) without overreacting to a single high-demand week, limiting excess holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (orders P1\u2013P5 all arrived after 4). No sustained demand regime shift (recent high demand only in P8\u2013P9, 2 periods). On-hand=173 + in-transit=123 = 296 vs default forecast demand over review+lead (1+L) periods; choose L informed by observed lead times and use default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This balances service level (use observed L=4) while avoiding overreacting to a short 2-period spike.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=100, in-transit=242. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1\u21925, P2\u21926, P3\u21927, P4\u21928, P5\u21929). No recent lost-shipment pattern persists. Demand sample mean (provided history) ~63/week; with review+lead (1+L)=5 that implies forecasted demand \u2248315 units over the replenishment horizon. To align the OR engine with observed lead time and stable demand, I choose to have the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use observed L=4) against holding cost by letting OR compute the exact base stock and cap from full-sample statistics.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent weekly demand has been elevated vs. the Jan samples (recent demands P5-P11 = 47,49,59,121,110,73,76) indicating a higher and more variable regime; on-hand=24, in-transit=360 (ample pipeline). Observed concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead times (several orders with lead_time=4), so use calculated lead time to reflect observed history. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7, last 7 demand periods P5\u2013P11) to capture the recent higher mean and volatility rather than the older Jan samples. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent regime while the large in-transit quantity reduces urgent ordering risk.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=457. Historical concludes show consistent observed lead_time=4 for multiple arrived batches (Period1->5, P2->6, P3->7, P4->8, P5->9, P8->12) \u2014 actual lead time confirmed at 4. Recent demand has risen vs the early sample set; last 4 concluded demand points are [110,73,76,130] (avg \u224897). To balance service (profit $19) against holding cost $1, I (a) set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses empirical lead-time, and (b) use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the higher recent demand regime and capture current mean/volatility over the review+lead period. This increases target base stock to avoid stockouts given large in-transit but recent high demand, while sigma_hat recent_N tightens variability estimate to recent behavior.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods (multiple orders observed with lead_time=4); use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality. On-hand=71, in-transit=473 so pipeline is substantial but demand since Period 8 shows elevated and more volatile weekly demand (recent demands: P9-P13 = 110,73,76,130,44). To capture the recent regime and higher variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (balances responsiveness and sample size). These parameters raise the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility to reduce stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind given large pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=135, in-transit=367; pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers expected demand over the next (1+L) periods. Historical concludes show consistent observed lead_time = 4 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=4). No sustained change in demand mean/variance in recent weeks (spike in P12 was transient). Therefore set L by calculate to reflect observed lead times; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L), balancing service level against holding cost given stable demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1-P11 that concluded indicate 4); on-hand=210, in-transit=249. Demand history shows weekly demand around 40\u2013130 (historical sample mean=63). I therefore set lead time to be calculated from observed concludes to confirm L=4, and use default demand/volatility estimators ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend applies the base-stock rule using the full-sample baseline while the chosen L aligns promised vs. observed arrivals. This balances service level (profit high vs. holding cost low) given current ample pipeline but avoids overreacting to recent spikes.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=112, in-transit=150. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period arrivals for all concluded orders (orders placed in P1..P12 that concluded give lead_time=4), so use inferred lead time via calculation. Demand history shows variability with a single large spike (203 in P16) but no sustained regime change (fewer than 3 consecutive elevated periods), so use default demand estimate to avoid overreacting to a single spike. Using calculate for L ensures the backend uses observed lead times; default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) balance service level vs holding cost given profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Observed lead time consistently 4 periods in concluded history; recent shipments have arrived on a 4-period cadence. On-hand=21 + in-transit=163 => pipeline=184 units, giving substantial cover. Profit/holding implies target service quantile q\u22480.95 so backend will target high fill; I therefore keep L as default (promised 4) and use default demand estimates so the OR engine uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). No sustained demand regime change (requires \u22653 contiguous high periods) is confirmed, so avoid recent-N or explicit adjustments; this balances service level needs with holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=317. Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; recent demand has jumped sharply in Periods 16-18 (203,222,157). To capture confirmed lead time I use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. To react to the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (Periods 16-18) so the (1+L) forecast and volatility reflect the sustained spike and avoid stockouts while in-transit buffer exists.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased from 74.7 (Periods 1-15) to 194.0 (Periods 16-18), +160%, sustained over 3 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24): recent demand regime shifted up starting Period 16 (sustained high demand: Periods 16-19 demands = 203,222,157,178; recent avg ~190). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To capture the new high-demand regime, I use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility (regime length=4). Keeping L=default (promised=4) since concluded arrivals match 4. These settings raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent data show a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (periods 16-20 demands = 203,222,157,178,230; recent mean \u2248198). On-hand 0, in-transit 797 \u2014 pipeline large enough to cover upcoming demand but we must size replenishment to new higher demand. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use calculated average lead time. Set L=calculate to capture confirmed LT=4. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the post-shift mean demand over the review+lead horizon (1+L periods). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility post-shift. These choices align base-stock to the higher demand regime while using observed lead time and recent variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 16: recent demands (P16-P21) = [203,222,157,178,230,151], average ~190; on-hand=0, in-transit=902 (large pipeline from prior orders). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time (will be ~4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses P16-P21). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices concentrate stocking on the sustained elevated demand while backend caps orders using its cap; relying on in-transit=902 will reduce immediate ordering but mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean so service levels target the new regime while holding cost weight ($1) is moderate relative to profit ($19).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Lead time evidence: concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period lead time (multiple orders with lead_time=4); no new lost-shipment signal. Demand regime shifted up at Period 16 and has remained high (Periods 16-22). To capture the sustained higher demand, set L to calculated (backend will infer avg observed LT \u22484). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (Periods 16-22) so the (1+L) forecast and volatility reflect the new higher regime and limit overstocks given large pipeline (on-hand 74, in-transit 907). This balances service (high profit) vs holding cost by sizing base-stock to recent elevated demand while relying on pipeline inventory.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand regime shifted up at Period 16 (sustained high weekly demand since then). On-hand=216, in-transit=734 \u2014 pipeline is large. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 repeatedly. To capture the post-changepoint higher demand and recent volatility, set lead time via observed average, and set demand mean/volatility using the most recent regime samples. I choose recent_N with N=8 (Periods 16-23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the elevated demand and current variability; this avoids dilution by the earlier low-demand periods and helps the OR backend set a higher base-stock while the calculate L ensures the backend uses confirmed lead time=4. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments is made because concludes show consistent 4-period arrivals recently; large pipeline reduces immediate stockout risk while the recent_N forecast reduces overstock risk compared with using all-history mean.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (avg increased ~+160% vs Periods 1-15) and observed lead time consistently 4 periods in concluded messages. Current on-hand=320 and in-transit=571 (pipeline total=891) \u2014 with (1+L)=5 this pipeline covers roughly 5\xd7recent weekly demand (~5\xd7164\u2248820), so stock looks adequate but we must keep forecasting on the higher, post-changepoint regime. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=9: Periods 16\u201324) to capture the new higher-demand regime when computing mu_hat across the review+lead horizon. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with the same N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias target stock toward the higher, sustained demand regime while using observed lead-time evidence so the backend's base-stock and cap calculations will provide enough replenishment to avoid stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (higher weekly demand since P16). On-hand=446 and in-transit=429 provide healthy coverage today. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages. I choose default L to use promised lead time (4). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16+): N=10 (Periods 16\u201325) to capture the higher recent mean and volatility rather than diluting with older low-demand data. This increases the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_recent captures current variability, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Demand shifted up starting Period 16 and has stayed elevated; recent regime length = 11 periods (P16\u2013P26). Current on-hand=530 and in-transit=356 provide strong coverage vs. expected demand, but we must size forecast to the higher regime. Use promised lead time (default 4) since concluded history consistently shows 4-period arrivals. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=11 to capture the new higher-demand regime (N = min(regime_length,20) = 11). This raises base stock appropriately to protect service while sigma estimated from the same recent window balances holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased from 74.7 (Periods 1-15) to 194.0 (Periods 16-18), +160%, sustained over 3 periods

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 16 (avg ~194 over P16-18 and continued higher demand through P27). On-hand=476, in-transit=345 (pipeline total 821) \u2014 ample cover vs. elevated demand but holding cost is low ($1) vs profit $19 so service is prioritized. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. For demand forecast use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean and volatility: N=12 (Periods 16\u201327 available, regime length=12). This raises mu_hat and sigma_hat to match the new regime, improving fill rates while keeping holding modest due to low holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16: mean demand jumped from ~74.7 (P1-15) to ~194 (P16-18) and remained elevated through P28. On-hand=485, in-transit=384 \u2014 pipeline is healthy. Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods, so set lead time to the observed average. To capture the post-shift demand level and recent volatility, use recent_N over the new regime (Periods 16\u201328, length 13). These parameters raise target base-stock to meet higher demand while the backend cap limits order size, balancing service (profit $19) against holding cost ($1).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Demand regime shift at Period 16 (sustained higher demand) remains the dominant pattern; recent regime spans Periods 16\u201329 (14 periods). Actual lead time has repeatedly been 4 periods so use promised/default L to align with OR engine. To capture the post-shift demand mean/volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 (uses last 14 periods of demand to scale (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively). Current on-hand (532) + in-transit (323) provide strong coverage vs. (1+L) demand; the recent_N choices focus the base stock on the higher recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=572, in-transit=264; profit=19, holding=1. Recent demand (Periods 23-30) = [107,133,123,88,130,65,60,59], avg \u2248 96 \u2014 lower than peak regime earlier but represents current demand. All concluded lead-time observations consistently show 4 periods. Pipeline + on-hand comfortably cover near-term demand, but to align OR ordering with recent demand and avoid excess holding cost I use a recent window. Chosen: L=default to trust promised lead time (confirmed historically), mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to base forecast on the last 8 weeks, sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to capture current volatility. This keeps service level appropriate while reducing carry risk given high on-hand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (mean rose ~+160% to ~194) and actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods. Current on-hand=579 + in-transit=199 gives large buffer versus recent weekly demand, but holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1). I therefore (1) keep L at promised (default) since concluded data consistently shows 4; (2) set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the higher post-changepoint demand regime (use last 16 periods covering Periods 16\u201331) so the backend bases base-stock on the new higher mean; (3) set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N=16 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices keep service levels appropriate for the sustained higher demand while avoiding underforecasting due to older low-demand data.

Demand regime shifted up at Period 16 and has persisted; use recent demand window to capture the new higher mean/volatility. On-hand=626 and in-transit=164 provide strong coverage vs. forecast but we still set demand estimates from recent regime to avoid stockouts. Chosen L: infer actual from observations. Chosen mu_hat/sigma_hat: use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to reflect higher mean and variance and to let OR backend compute base-stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff.

Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=559, in-transit=167. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (higher mean since P16). No new missing-shipment signals. To capture the post-shift demand level I use recent_N on demand (covering the recent high-demand regime length ~19 periods) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 19 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=19 to reflect recent volatility. L kept as default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. These choices keep pipeline coverage aligned with the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding overstating variability from older low-demand data.

On-hand=555 + in-transit=214 = 769 units, which comfortably covers multiple review+lead periods. I select L=default (use promised lead time=4) and use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages the full historical sample set and the engine's z* calculation (q=0.95) to balance high service level versus holding cost given current ample inventory.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand (Periods 31-35 = 58,66,113,44,36) averages ~63.4/week; inventory on-hand 519 + in-transit 214 = 733 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at this pace. Historical concludes consistently show 4-period actual lead time for many arrivals; no new prolonged misses. I therefore keep L as default (promised 4). To react to the most recent demand level and avoid overstocking from the earlier high-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts based on the last 5 observed demands and the recent volatility. This balances service (cover short-term demand) vs holding cost given large current inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=541, in-transit=136. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P->P+4 arrivals); no evidence shipments are lost now. Demand regime shift at Period 16 (avg up ~+160%) is sustained; use recent regime data to set demand forecast. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (4) since concludes confirm it. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint regime (regime length \u226520) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most relevant recent 20 samples. This raises the base-stock to meet the higher demand while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding (holding cost low relative to profit, so target high service).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (avg up ~+160%) \u2014 use recent regime data. Concluded arrivals consistently imply a 4-period lead time (no recent evidence of loss). Current on-hand=473, in-transit=76 gives healthy coverage; set L to calculated average observed lead time to match evidence. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (cap N at 20 per rules). This balances higher demand (improves service) while limiting excess stock via recent volatility estimate.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Demand history shows a past sustained regime shift around Period 16 (higher demand then), but recent weekly demand (Periods 35-39: 36,56,116,88,71) is mixed and inventory is high (on-hand 402, in-transit 206 = 608 total). Observed concluded lead times consistently equal 4 periods \u2014 no new evidence to change. Profit/holding (19/1) implies a high service target. To avoid unnecessary ordering given large on-hand + pipeline, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and volatility with promised lead time (L=4). This keeps orders conservative while meeting high service level and limiting holding cost given current ample inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 16 (higher mean since then) and observed lead times consistently 4 periods in concluded messages. Current inventory: on-hand=346, in-transit=244. I set L by calculating observed lead time (matches promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint regime (use last 20 demand samples to reflect the higher-demand regime and reduce influence of pre-shift low-demand data). Sigma set recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets safety stock appropriate for the elevated demand while relying on confirmed lead-time behavior.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=379, in-transit=168. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (no new prolonged missing shipments). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 16 (avg up ~+160% vs Periods 1-15). To capture the new higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding, I use the promised/default lead time and compute demand forecasts from the most recent data window covering the post-shift regime. I select recent_N with N=20 to weight the recent high-demand periods (capped at 20 per rules) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend raises the base-stock and safety stock appropriately given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=291, in-transit=168. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P->P+4 arrivals); no new prolonged missing shipments. Recent demand (Periods 38-42 = 88,71,56,43,88) suggests using a short recent sample to capture current demand level. Set L to default (promised 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands so forecast reflects current run-rate. Keep sigma_hat default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Current on-hand=392, in-transit=104. Promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period lead time for many orders (multiple 'arrived' messages indicate lead_time=4). Recent history shows demand regime shift at Period 16 (noted in carry-over), but recent weeks (Periods 39-43) show moderate demand (71,56,43,88,29). Given stable observed lead-time=4 and mixed demand since the earlier regime shift, I use the backend defaults to avoid overfitting to short recent noise. This keeps base-stock anchored to long-run sample statistics while the OR engine's cap limits order size. On-hand + in-transit (496 units) provides several weeks of coverage; using default estimates balances service level against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

No new sustained demand regime beyond the previously recorded shift at Period 16; recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 so use calculated lead time to reflect observed data.

Demand regime shift at Period 16 (+160%) persists through history; recent demand is substantially higher than the earliest 5-sample seed. To prioritize service while controlling holding cost, use the promised/default lead time and compute demand forecast from the most recent data window to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime. I choose recent_N with N=20 to capture recent elevated mean/variance while smoothing short-week noise; sigma_hat uses the same recent window for consistent safety stock sizing.
