Ordering 92 increases pipeline to 169, avoids overcommitting inventory given holding cost equals profit, and keeps exposure moderate while awaiting conclusive arrival data.

Inventory: on-hand = 84, in-transit = 0, so pipeline covers 0 of the next 5 periods. OR recommended 240 (uses older history and promised L) which is far below the recent realized demand spike. Given confirmed L=4, I must ensure pipeline + on-hand \u2248 expected 5-period demand to avoid massive lost sales while the order is en route. With equal profit and holding cost (profit=$1, holding=$1), the critical fractile is 0.5 (no extra safety stock beyond mean), so I target \u2248740 total inventory for the review+lead horizon. Order = max(0, 740 \u2212 84) = 656. I round to 656 units to cover expected demand through the lead window. This overrides OR's 240 because recent demand is much higher and shipments will take 4 periods to arrive.

Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=980 (orders from P45=656 and P46=324 arriving in future). OR recommends 0 but uses promised L and long-run history; it ignores recent high-demand regime. Demand outlook: recent periods show elevated demand (P42\u2013P46 = 47,235,370,293,162; last 5-week average \u2248221 units/week).
