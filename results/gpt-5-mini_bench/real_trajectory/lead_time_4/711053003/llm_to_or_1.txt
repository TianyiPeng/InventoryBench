Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show mean demand ~31.8 units/week (samples: 13,21,55,47,23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no observed lead-time history yet. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this provides a baseline base-stock given profit $4 vs holding $1 (high service target). No explicit adjustment due to lack of arrivals or sustained regime change evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand: Period1 demand=79 (one high sample) vs historical weekly samples (13,21,55,47,23). On-hand=0, in-transit=62 (ordered in Period1) \u2014 with promised L=4 this in-transit is expected to arrive later, so do not treat it as arrived. No concluded arrivals exist to infer a lead-time change. The single high demand (79) is not yet a sustained regime shift (needs \u22653 periods). Therefore use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance; this balances service level given limited evidence of a demand shift while avoiding overreacting and incurring extra holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent realized weekly demand (Period1=79, Period2=115) is well above historical Jan samples (mean~31.8), and pipeline shows 144 units in-transit (62+82). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed. I keep L as promised (default) because concluded messages do not yet show a consistent lead-time shift. To respond to the recent demand surge while still leveraging longer history, I set mu_hat via EWMA (gamma=0.6) to put substantial weight on the high recent demands. I leave sigma_hat as default to let the backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service-level need from recent spikes against holding cost and uncertainty about arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly Jan samples show mean ~31.8, but the last three observed weeks show a sustained higher demand (79,115,96). On-hand=0, in-transit=283 (sum of prior orders) and promised lead time=4 \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so do not change L. I set L=default to use promised lead time. Demand appears to have shifted to a higher regime; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the new mean over the last three observed demands. Volatility should reflect recent variability, so use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the higher short-term demand while the pipeline (283) will be used by the OR engine when computing orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: recent 3 periods avg = 96.67 vs prior sample avg = 31.8 (+204%); sustained for 3 periods (Periods 1-3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=410; no concluded arrivals yet so cannot confirm lead-time change. Recent demand has shifted up: last 3 observed demands = 115,96,117 (avg 109.33) vs prior sample avg ~31.8; this regime (higher mean) is sustained for 3 periods. To respond, keep promised lead time but set demand forecast and volatility based on the recent high-demand regime (recent_N=3) so orders cover (1+L) periods of the new demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=477. Concluded history shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time=4) \u2014 so actual lead time matches promised. Recent demand levels are elevated (Period1-5 demands = 79,115,96,117,81; recent average \u2248 97). To cover review+lead (1+L) periods and reflect the sustained high-demand regime, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times), and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand parameters from the last 5 periods. This balances higher service-level need from increased demand while avoiding excess stock by using recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (order on Period 1 arrived on Period 5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=440. Historical concluded lead times observed = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6) so use observed-average lead time. Demand has clearly shifted up vs early samples; recent weeks show substantially higher demand (roughly 80\u2013117). To capture the new regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility (N=5 uses the most recent 5 demand samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean and variability. L set to calculate to lock in observed lead time=4. These settings raise the base-stock to improve service while the sigma estimate manages safety stock given holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). On-hand=44, in-transit=392. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history. Demand regime increased recently: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 5-7) = 81, 92, 95 (sustained 3-period uplift vs prior mean ~31.8). To capture the new higher-demand regime I set L to the promised lead time and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the most recent regime samples and captures recent volatility, while relying on confirmed lead-time behavior to avoid underordering despite past lost/delayed arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=290. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders on P1\u2013P4 arrived after 4). Demand has exhibited a sustained higher regime (carry-over note: recent 3-period average ~96.7 vs prior ~31.8). I set L using calculate to lock in the empirically observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the confirmed higher-demand regime (captures current mean and volatility over the most recent stable regime). These parameters raise target base-stock to avoid stockouts while sigma from recent data prevents extreme overstock; using recent_N mitigates bias from older low-demand samples. On-hand + in-transit (290) will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing final order against the new base stock.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand is well above the original sample mean: sustained regime shift since Period 4 (higher demand). Current inventory: on-hand=28, in-transit=379 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand remains elevated; no evidence of lost shipments (observed lead times = 4). Set L to calculated average of observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=6 (regime from Period 4 through Period 9, 6 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 demands to capture the new higher-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect increased volatility in the same recent window. These choices raise base-stock to meet elevated demand while the recent_N volatility captures uncertainty to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent realized demand is high and variable (last 10 demands: 79,115,96,117,81,92,95,190,101,81) and prior conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=512 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals lag due to L=4). Profit/holding ratio implies high service target (q\u22480.8). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods: 92,95,190,101,81) to capture the current high-demand regime and avoid dilution by older low samples. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet elevated short-term demand while the cap still limits overly large single orders, balancing service level and holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (sustained elevated weekly demand ~80\u2013190) and lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history. On-hand=17, in-transit=552 (large pipeline). To capture the sustained higher demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples (most recent regime length = 7 periods: Periods 5\u201311) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent variability. I set L to be computed from observed lead times so the backend uses confirmed actual lead-time evidence. This choice raises target base-stock to avoid stockouts given profit>holding cost while sigma_hat from recent data protects service level versus demand volatility; the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure but we still supply recent-demand-based parameters to balance service level and holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=544 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. Recent demand remains elevated versus original Jan samples; to capture the recent regime I use recent data. L: use 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=4. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demand observations, capturing the post-shift higher mean. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock aligned to confirmed LT=4 and recent higher demand while avoiding excessive responsiveness to single-period spikes given substantial pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand elevated vs initial sample; last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 9-13) avg \u2248 86 units/week vs earlier baseline ~32. On-hand=146, in-transit=420 (pipeline large and consistent; no overdue/lost shipments observed; lead time confirmed as 4 in concl messages). I set L to 'calculate' to lock to the observed average lead time (4 periods). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (uses last 5 weeks to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility), which raises target base-stock to meet high service-level implied by profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding excess safety from older low-demand data.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=243, in-transit=242 (total pipeline=485). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (confirmed in Period 6); demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 5 (sustained ~80\u2013190/week). I set L to 'calculate' to lock to observed lead time (4). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime across the last 10 concluded weeks; same recent_N (N=10) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the backend bases base-stock on the current high-demand regime and the confirmed lead time so orders cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while keeping holding cost awareness via the capped ordering rule.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=278, in-transit=177. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Recent demand regime elevated and sustained (recent regime ~3 periods). To reflect confirmed lead time I use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (should be 4). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std are driven by the most recent 3 demand samples, improving service-level sizing while limiting excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=52, in-transit=160. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple observations), and demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 with recent volatility (notably demand=243 in Period 16). I choose L=calculate to lock to observed lead times (avg observed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to base (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the last 12 demand samples to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short spikes. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by using recent regime data rather than all historic low-demand samples.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/6/10. On-hand=0, in-transit=262 (several 4-period arrivals observed historically). Recent demand elevated vs early sample; last 5 demands = [72,81,96,243,178] suggesting higher mean and volatility. Set L to calculate (backend will confirm average observed lead time = 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime while smoothing extreme single-week spikes. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect elevated recent variability. These choices raise base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon given confirmed 4-period arrivals and balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent demand has risen sharply: Periods 16-18 demands = [243,178,132], suggesting a new high-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=518 units (covers ~2.8 periods at recent pace), so pipeline likely insufficient given promised lead time=4. Historical observed lead times are consistently 4. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 4. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new regime (most recent sustained 3 periods). I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect current volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service during the higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine cap orders using its cap logic to limit overstock given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg of Periods 16-18 = 184 vs prior sample avg = 31.8 (+~480%); sustained for 3 periods (Periods 16-18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward: Periods 16-18 avg demand = 184.3/week (243,178,132) vs prior sample avg ~31.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=729 units. Promised lead time=4 and prior concluded history repeatedly confirms actual L=4. With review+lead (1+L)=5, a recent-3 based forecast implies (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*184.3 \u2248 921.7 units needed to cover the next 5 periods; current pipeline (729) falls short, so parameters should target the elevated regime. I therefore: keep lead time at default (promised 4), use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the confirmed high-demand regime, and use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to represent current volatility. This raises the base-stock to satisfy service with the new demand level while keeping variability estimate focused on the recent regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). On-hand 0, in-transit 1042. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 observations) and a sustained high-demand regime beginning around Period 16 (Periods 16-18 avg >> prior). I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the confirmed recent high-demand regime (use last 3 periods in the high regime) so mu_hat reflects elevated mean over the (1+L) review+lead window and sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service-level (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but recurring late arrivals) vs holding cost by anchoring on confirmed recent demand rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 16 (Periods 16-21 demand elevated: 243,178,132,273,201,160) and confirmed actual lead time = 4 in prior concludes. Current on-hand=36, in-transit=947 (large pipeline). To reflect the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the recent regime (6 most recent periods since the changepoint). I keep lead time at promised/default (4) because concluded arrivals consistently show 4. Sigma uses recent_N (same N=6) to capture recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to a higher base stock to meet elevated demand while sigma captures variability to set safety stock; keeping L=default aligns with observed lead time and the large in-transit inventory is accounted for by the pipeline term in the ordering rule.

Demand has a sustained higher regime beginning Period 16 (Periods 16-22 show elevated weekly demand vs earlier samples). To capture the confirmed lead time I use 'calculate' for L (backend will compute from observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Period 16\u201322 length \u22487), so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the new regime and limit stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22): recent weeks show sustained high demand since Period 16 (carry-over noted). On-hand=192, in-transit=577 => pipeline adequate but some arrivals may be delayed historically; confirmed lead time=4 from prior evidence. I set L=default to use promised (4) since observed lead time matches promised. I use mu_hat recent_N N=3 to capture the current elevated regime (Periods 21-23 demands = 160,109,268; recent avg ~179 \u2192 (1+L)\xd7recent mean will reflect current demand). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep targets responsive to the new high-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples; they help the OR backend balance service level (high fill given strong recent demand) versus holding cost by using short recent window.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Recent demand regime remains elevated since Period 16 (sustained high weekly demand ~180+ vs historical ~32). On-hand=289 and in-transit=543 provide large pipeline cover, but past history shows occasional missed/zero arrivals despite promised LT=4; however concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 16-24, regime length=9) so forecasts and safety stock reflect the new mean and volatility. I keep L=default (promised 4) because concluded messages confirm LT=4 and backend expects promised LT. This balances service (respond to higher demand) while avoiding excess overstock since pipeline already large.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history shows a sustained higher demand regime since Period 16 (avg ~184 for P16-18 and high volumes thereafter). Lead time has consistently concluded as 4 periods in history. Current on-hand=222 and in-transit=709 provide large pipeline coverage. I set L to default (promised 4) since concluded lead-times equal promise; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=10 to focus the forecast and variability on the recent high-demand regime (last 10 periods) so the OR backend raises base stock to meet elevated demand while capping orders per policy to limit excess holding costs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 16 (Periods 16-26 demand consistently elevated). On-hand=207 and in-transit=751 (ample pipeline vs (1+L) demand coverage) but shipments have previously observed lead_time=4. I set L=calculate to lock in the empirically observed lead time average (recent concluded arrivals all indicate 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 16-26 constitute an 11-period high-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects the elevated recent mean across the review+lead window. Volatility is set recent_N N=11 to capture current demand variability. These choices keep base stock responsive to the confirmed higher demand while using observed lead-time; with profit=4 and holding=1 this balances service level vs holding cost given strong pipeline.

Actual lead time repeatedly observed = 4. I set L to default (promised lead time = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the post-Period-16 high-demand regime (periods 16\u201327) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean over the review+lead window.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (Periods 16-28 show much higher weekly demand vs earlier sample). Lead time observations (concluded messages) are consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand 338 + in-transit 582 = 920 units, which provides substantial coverage vs. elevated demand but we still target the recent high-demand regime for forecasting. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4). For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N over the detected high-demand regime (Periods 16-28, regime length 13) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and variability; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost given already-large pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4) and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 16 (elevated weekly demand since P16). Current inventory: on-hand=346, in-transit=386 (ample pipeline). To capture the elevated recent demand profile I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent regime samples (Periods 16-29, regime length=14) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the current sustained regime. L uses default (promised=4) which matches observed arrivals. This balances service (higher recent mean) with holding cost by using recent-regime statistics rather than diluting with much lower early-period samples.

These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while recognizing confirmed lead time and avoiding over-reaction to older low-demand samples.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 16 (sustained). To reflect confirmed lead time and the sustained higher-demand regime, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 4). For demand forecast (mu_hat) I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the new higher mean (N=16 covers Periods 16\u201331). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with the same N=16 to reflect elevated variability in the new regime. These choices ensure the OR backend raises the base-stock to serve higher ongoing demand while using observed lead time to avoid under-ordering given long replenishment delays.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (carry-over notes: avg Periods16-18=184 vs prior avg~31.8).

I choose N=18 (Periods 16\u201333 regime length \u224818, N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current sustained higher mean and volatility; this raises base_stock to avoid stockouts while the capped order size limits extreme orders, balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=219, in-transit=650. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders with W=4), so use calculated lead time. Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (carry-over notes) \u2014 use recent sample-based forecast to capture the new mean/volatility. I choose recent_N with N=19 (Periods 16\u201334 inclusive) to reflect the sustained elevated demand regime while providing enough samples. This increases base_stock to meet higher demand and keeps sigma adaptive; using calculate for L lets the backend confirm lead time=4 from observations. No evidence of lost shipments currently; pipeline + on-hand is large but higher mu_hat is needed to avoid stockouts given the elevated regime and 4-period lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=305, in-transit=588 (total pipeline 893) which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of elevated demand. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead time and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 16. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility (captures Periods 16-35). I keep L as default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms it. These parameters bias the OR base-stock upward to protect service level during the confirmed higher-demand regime while sigma from the same recent window informs safety stock sizing.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: Periods 1\u21925, 2\u21926, etc.). Demand regime has been higher since Period 16 (sustained). On-hand=419, in-transit=443 (healthy pipeline). Set L to calculated average of observed lead times (confirming 4). Use recent_N for demand estimates to focus on the post-change high-demand regime; choose N=20 to capture the most recent ~20 weeks of elevated demand while smoothing short noise. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices align the OR base-stock calc to recent high-demand behavior and confirmed lead time, avoiding understock from legacy low-demand samples while keeping holding cost in mind given large on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weekly demand has been elevated vs the early-sample baseline but shows variability (Periods 31-37 demands: 214,141,177,87,95,108,185). On-hand=340, in-transit=410 (pipeline=410) \u2014 ample coverage but demand has shifted since initial 2019 samples. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages, so use calculated observed lead time. To reflect the recent demand regime and reduce sensitivity to old low-demand samples, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 7 demand observations (Periods 31-37). This biases the base-stock toward current demand levels while capturing recent volatility, balancing service level (profit high relative to holding cost) against holding cost given substantial on-hand/pipeline inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=335, in-transit=332. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed many times). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16 (sustained), so use recent demand to reflect current regime. Set L via calculate to lock in observed lead-time behavior. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent sustained high-demand regime while respecting the N selection rule) so the OR backend will size the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated demand and the capped order prevents excessive single-period receipts; this balances service level (reduce stockouts) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). On-hand=369, in-transit=476 -> substantial pipeline coverage. Given confirmed LT=4 and no new sustained demand regime change in the most recent periods, use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality and default demand estimates (use all-history mean/vol) so the OR backend computes base-stock balancing high service level (profit/holding -> q=0.8) against holding costs. This avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise while the large pipeline already provides coverage.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been elevated versus early-sample regime (recent 5-period average ~137 units/week). On-hand=284 and in-transit=399 gives strong pipeline cover; no evidence of lost shipments recently (arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time historically). To be responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to promised lead time and use recent_N=5 for demand mean/volatility so the OR backend sizes base-stock to recent demand (reduces stockouts) while pipeline inventory already provides buffer to limit extra ordering and holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=298, in-transit=406. Historical concluded lead times are stable at 4 periods (many observed P\u2192P+4 arrivals). Demand has remained in a higher regime since Period 16 but recent week-to-week variability exists; to be responsive to the recent elevated regime while dampening older low-demand samples, I use a recent-window estimate for demand mean and volatility. No currently overdue/lost shipments to account for\u2014pipeline (406) plus on-hand gives ample cover, but we still target (1+L)-period recent demand to set base stock and limit holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4 (service quantile q=4/(4+1)=0.8). Methods chosen: L estimated from observed lead times (calculate); mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from the recent N=20 samples to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise.

Recent demand (Periods 40-42) = [162, 59, 126], recent 3-pt avg \u2248115.7. To avoid excess holding given large pipeline, keep L as promised (default). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest regime and reduce ordering velocity compared with long-run averages. This tightens target base-stock and lowers risk of extra holding while maintaining service for near-term demand.

Current inventory: on-hand=445, in-transit=233 (pipeline=678) which comfortably covers several periods of recent demand; no shipments appear overdue. Demand has shown prior sustained regime shifts, but most recent concluded demands (Periods 41-43 = 59,126,53) revert to a lower/mid level. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time=4. For forecasting I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the most recent demand regime and avoid over-ordering given large on-hand stock; this keeps the base-stock responsive to current demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Recent demand has softened in Dec (last 5 weekly demands = 162,59,126,53,35 \u2192 avg ~87), so base-stock should be driven by recent short-run demand rather than full-sample mean to avoid excess holding cost. I set L using calculated average of observed lead times (reflects confirmed LT=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime; this reduces ordered quantities vs. using the long-run high-demand regime and balances profit vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Recent demand (Periods 43-45 = 53, 35, 47) is well below earlier high-demand regimes; evidence points to a low-demand regime over the last 3 periods.

711053003: ordered=0, arrived=153 units (ordered on Period 42, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=596, demand=120, sold=120, ending on-hand inventory=476

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand is high (476) and in-transit=0; recent concluded periods show normal arrivals with confirmed lead_time=4 historically. Given large on-hand stock vs recent lower weekly demand (Dec weeks: 35,47,120, etc.), I choose the promised lead time and default demand/statistics so backend uses full sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This avoids placing additional stock and reduces holding cost while allowing the OR engine to compute appropriate replenishment.
