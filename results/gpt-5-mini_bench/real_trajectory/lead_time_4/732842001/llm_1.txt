  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date is 2019-02-11 (mid-February). No major holiday this week; however historical demand shows a strong upward trend through January into early February for this SKU (likely a sell-through spike or promotion). Demand analysis: historical weekly samples show 2019-01-07:0, 2019-01-14:1, 2019-01-21:36, 2019-01-28:100, 2019-02-04:215 \u2014 clear rapid increase. With profit=$1 and holding=$1 per unit/period, excess inventory destroys margin; avoid overstock. Lead time & pipeline: promised lead time = 4 periods; no on-hand or in-transit inventory currently. Orders placed now will arrive in Period 5 (arrivals observed later), so we must cover expected demand starting several periods forward. Decision logic: because demand has accelerated substantially but holding cost equals profit, I take a cautious, test-and-scale approach \u2014 place a limited replenishment to mitigate stockout risk once the spike continues, but avoid heavy inventory that would incur high holding cost if demand softens. Order sized to provide coverage if the recent high demand persists for a short horizon without creating large carryover.",
