Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand shows a clear upward shift: samples = [0,1,36,100,215] with the last three periods (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) averaging 117 units versus prior average 0.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the higher regime. Set L to default (promised lead time=4) because no concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the new high-demand regime and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect increased volatility; this raises base-stock to prioritize service given profit and holding cost parity.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: prior avg (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14)=0.5; recent avg (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04)=117 (+116.5 units, +23300%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent historical samples show a clear regime shift starting 2019-01-21: last 3 samples = [36,100,215] (mean=117) vs earlier near-zero. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=267 (ordered in P1, arrived=0 in P1 conclude) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be confirmed. Use promised lead time (default) since insufficient evidence to override. Set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (gives (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). Set sigma_hat recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the sustained demand increase while letting the OR engine trade off holding cost via its z* cap.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand samples show a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (much higher demand since). No concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 (both concluded arrived=0), so actual lead time cannot be inferred; possible delays/losses exist but are not yet confirmed. Use default promised lead time to avoid overfitting to incomplete arrival data. For demand, use the full-sample default (captures the confirmed high-demand regime reflected in historical samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples). For variability, use default to let the OR engine compute sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). These choices balance service level (accounting for the higher recent mean) against holding cost while remaining conservative about unconfirmed lead-time changes and potentially lost shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=523. Recent observed demand (Periods 1-3) = {167,156,125}, recent mean \u2248149 over last 3 periods reflecting the post-2019-01-21 high-demand regime. No concluded arrivals yet, so cannot confirm an actual lead-time change; use promised lead time. Set L=default to retain promised 4-period lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to target the elevated recent demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean over last 3 periods). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility and ensure the OR backend sizes safety stock to cover observed variability. This balances higher service level for the sustained demand spike while avoiding excessive holdings beyond the observed short-run variance; in-transit cover exists but arrivals are not yet concluded so parameters prioritize matching current high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand has settled at a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (historical weekly samples: 0,1,36,100,215; recent period demands observed in concludes: 167,156,125,117). Many outstanding in-transit units (709 = orders P1:267, P2:256, P4:186) have not concluded as arrivals across multiple periods, suggesting delayed/lost shipments. I set L explicitly longer than the promised lead time to reflect shipment uncertainty (so the backend inflates safety stock appropriately). For demand I use recent_N=4 (the last 4 observed demands 167,156,125,117) to capture the current elevated regime and reduce influence of pre-shift low samples; same N for volatility to reflect recent variability.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (ordered totals 267,256,0,186 = 709 in-transit) \u2014 shipments overdue across multiple promised lead times; possible lost/delayed shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand regime established starting 2019-01-21: recent per-period demands = {2019-01-21:36, 2019-01-28:100, 2019-02-04:215} (recent mean=117). Current inventory: on-hand=164, in-transit=623 (total pipeline=787) which comfortably covers multiple periods. Historical arrival evidence: order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 indicating a 4-period lead time. To capture the sustained higher demand since 2019-01-21, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (N=3). For L I use observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed lead-time=4. These choices bias the OR engine toward stocking for the new higher-demand regime while using observed lead time to avoid underordering given past overdue shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (order placed Period 1 arrived in Period 5: lead_time=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent demand regime shifted up starting 2019-01-21 and has persisted through observed periods (sustained high weekly demand ~100+). On-hand = 305, in-transit = 367; two overdue shipments from Periods 1-2 have arrived (lead_time confirmed 4), remaining in-transit likely valid. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute pipeline-adjusted base stock, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (uses confirmed 4). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts and variability on the most recent regime (N=5 balances recency with sample size). These parameters prioritize meeting the high current demand while keeping holding cost in check via downstream OR cap.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1->arrived P5, P2->arrived P6). Demand has shifted to a higher sustained regime: recent period demands = [167,156,125,117,103,115,112] (Periods 1-7). To capture the sustained higher mean and recent variability, set L by calculating observed lead times and set demand moments using recent_N over the last 7 periods (regime length=7). This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the confirmed higher demand while sigma from recent data reflects current volatility and avoids understocking given overdue/lost-shipments history.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent demand has settled after the Jan spike; last 4 concluded demands = [103,115,112,57], avg=96.75. On-hand=322, in-transit=261 (no outstanding overdue shipments now; recent arrivals confirmed lead_time=4). I select L by calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg observed =4). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the post-spike regime over the last 4 periods; mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7mean_recent. For volatility I use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent variability. These choices keep target base stock aligned to the confirmed lead time and current demand regime, trading service against holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

On-hand=431 and in-transit=80 (no newly concluded losses). Use promised lead time and base recent demand for forecast to avoid overreacting to early spike while capturing current lower demand.

Demand has sustained high regime since 2019-01-21 (periods since then show ~100+ weekly demand); to capture the recent higher mean while limiting noise I use a recent-window estimate. Choose L by averaging observed lead times (confirming 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term fluctuations. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large mean) vs holding (profit=holding \u2192 critical fractile 0.5 so safety stock modest).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): recent demand stabilized around ~100 units/week after the large regime shift earlier in Jan\u2013Feb. On-hand=240, in-transit=111 (no new overdue conclusions; lead time observations consistently 4). I choose L=calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg observed = 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the most recent stable regime (Periods 5\u201312) and avoid older low-sample noise; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep base_stock responsive to current demand while limiting excess holding given equal profit and holding costs ($1/$1).

Demand regime shifted up beginning 2019-01-21 and recent weekly demand is ~volatile but elevated; using a recent window captures current mean/volatility while avoiding stale low pre-shift samples. Set L by observed lead times (calculate). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 6 demand observations (Periods 8\u201313 = 57,72,63,98,110,89) so OR backend builds a base-stock that balances service vs holding given confirmed lead time and recent demand.

Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders observed arriving with W=4), and demand shifted to a higher regime starting 2019-01-21. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 5\u201314) averages ~93 with moderate variability. To keep pipeline aligned with the confirmed 4-period lead time and the post-change higher demand, I use calculate for L (lets backend confirm =4) and recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, so the OR engine computes base-stock and cap using the most relevant 10-period demand statistics, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1->arrived P5, P2->P6, P4->P8, P8->P12, P11->P15). Demand regime has been the elevated regime since 2019-01-21; recent demand samples (Periods 5\u201315) are stable without a new changepoint. To reflect confirmed lead time, set L by calculating from observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N over the last 11 concluded demand observations (Periods 5\u201315) to capture the sustained higher demand; use the same recent_N window for sigma to represent current volatility. These choices keep stock targeted to the higher post-shift demand while the OR backend caps orders using its cap formula to limit overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Recent demand (Periods 11-16 = 98,110,89,108,99,60) averages ~94 units/period with moderate variance; inventory currently on-hand=42, in-transit=365 (sufficient pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. I set L by calculate to lock in the empirically observed lead time. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime (last 6 periods) so the OR engine targets an (L+1)-period demand covering tuned to current demand rather than older pre-regime samples.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent weekly demand has been stable since the large regime shift beginning 2019-01-21; last 13 concluded demands (Periods 5\u201317) average moderately (~~85/week) with moderate variability. On-hand=103, in-transit=322 (pipeline=425) which covers multiple weeks; historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. To keep service while avoiding extra holding (profit=holding), I set lead time based on observed data and use recent_N (last 13 weeks) for demand and volatility to capture the current post-shift regime and avoid diluting with the tiny pre-shift samples.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Observed concluded lead times consistently = 4 periods (multiple orders confirmed arriving after 4). Current on-hand=105, in-transit=292. Demand since the early spike has stabilized into a lower, consistent regime; last 12 concluded period demands (P7\u2013P18) average \u224879.3/week. To reflect the confirmed lead time and recent demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times, and set demand forecasts using the most recent 12 periods to capture the current mean and volatility over the review+lead horizon (1+L=5 periods). This keeps service high enough given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) while avoiding excess inventory from older high-demand outliers.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has settled well below the early spike (most recent weeks ~34\u2013115). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods by multiple conclude messages. To reflect recent demand regime and avoid overstocking, set L using promised/default (confirmed=4) and forecast demand using recent data. Chosen L: default (promised 4). Chosen mu_hat: recent_N with N=12 to capture last ~3 months of demand while smoothing older spike. Chosen sigma_hat: recent_N with N=12 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine toward the current lower-demand regime and limit extra ordering given already substantial on-hand + in-transit.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=269, in-transit=74. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders placed P1..P16 arrived after 4 periods). Recent demand has declined from the spring peak; last 9 concluded weekly demands (P12\u2013P20) average \u224867 units with a clear downward trend. To reflect confirmed lead time and emphasize recent lower demand while keeping volatility estimated from recent data, I set L to calculated average observed lead time=4, mu_hat using an EWMA to weight recent declines (gamma=0.3), and sigma_hat from the last 9 demand samples to capture recent variability. These choices reduce target stock to avoid excess holding while preserving service for near-term demand and accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has settled well below the early spike; last 8 demands (Periods 16-23) average ~43.5/week. On-hand=192, in-transit=84; with promised L=4 we must cover (1+L)=5 periods ahead. I set L=default to use the promised 4-period lead time (actual lead time repeatedly observed as 4 in history). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current lower post-spike regime rather than the earlier high-volume weeks. Sigma is recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (cover ~5\xd7 recent weekly demand) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has settled to modest summer levels (last 5 concluded demands: 21,54,65,31,22; mean=38.6). On-hand=171 + in-transit=83 = 254 units, which covers ~5 periods of recent demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use observed average to capture that. To balance service vs holding cost I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and variability to reflect the current summer regime and avoid overstocking, and calculate lead time from observed concludes to lock in L=4.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weekly demand has been stable since the large early-Feb regime shift (typical weekly sales ~30\u2013100; recent 8 weeks avg \u2248 ~45\u201360). On-hand=116, in-transit=83 (pipeline healthy). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time, so use calculated lead time to reflect that. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent steady demand regime (reduces influence of the Feb spike). These choices keep base-stock responsive to current demand while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent weekly demand has stabilized at a much lower level than the spike in Feb\u2013Mar 2019; last 12 concluded demands (P15\u2013P26) average ~59 units/week with low variance. On-hand=64, in-transit=84 (total pipeline=148) \u2014 sufficient for short horizon but we must replenish for ongoing demand. Observed concluded lead times across history consistently equal 4 periods (orders placed in Pn arrive in Pn+4). I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 4). To keep forecasts responsive to the current lower-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base_stock that reflects the last ~3 months of demand and recent volatility; this balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Current on-hand=50, in-transit=85. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead_time=4 across many orders; no evidence of new lead-time delays or lost shipments in recent periods. Demand experienced a large regime shift early 2019 (recorded previously) and has since stabilized; to focus the forecast on the recent stable regime I use recent_N over the most recent 20 demand periods to estimate (1+L)-period demand and volatility, while using calculated lead time to reflect observed history. These parameters prioritize matching pipeline to ~5-period demand (review+lead) to avoid stockouts while limiting holding given profit=holding.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=196. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 repeatedly (no recent deviation). Demand since mid-2019 has settled into a lower, stable regime (recent weekly demand mostly ~21\u2013115, more commonly 50\u2013100). To keep service while limiting hold costs given profit=holding cost ($1/$1 -> q=0.5), use promised lead time (default) and base forecasts from recent history to capture current regime. I choose recent_N=12 to reflect roughly the last quarter of observations (Periods 17\u201328) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent regime. No new sustained changepoint or lead-time shift to carry over.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=244. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 matches), so use observed average lead time. Recent demand has been stable since the early surge (no new sustained regime change); therefore forecast demand using recent history to capture current pace. I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times (will confirm ~4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=12) to base the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the last 12 demand observations, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each). This keeps orders responsive to recent demand while avoiding excess inventory given existing in-transit stock.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand regime is the post-2019-01-21 high-demand regime (sustained weekly demand ~30-115 recently). On-hand=0, in-transit=248; several prior orders consistently concluded with observed lead_time=4 so promised L=4 is appropriate. To focus the forecast on the recent stable regime, use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std computed from the last 20 demand samples. This balances service (capture recent higher mean) versus holding cost by using only recent data rather than the full historical series which includes near-zero early samples.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent weekly demand has stabilized around ~59 units (last 8 weeks avg = 58.9). On-hand=28, in-transit=233 \u2192 total pipeline=261, while (1+L)=5 periods of demand at ~59 => ~295 units needed to cover review+lead; slight shortfall. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (confirming 4). I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-changepoint regime (most recent 8 weeks) so the OR backend builds a base stock reflecting current demand while limiting excess holding costs.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23. Recent demand has been modest but consistent (last 5 period demands ~71,57,61,56,46 avg\u224858). On-hand=93 + in-transit=156 => pipeline covers several weeks but demand continues so maintain provisioning. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show orders placed \u2192 arrived after 4 periods); using calculated lead time (average observed) aligns with evidence. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest lower-demand regime (N chosen = 5 recent periods). This balances service (avoid stockouts) while limiting holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. Demand has been steady at a higher regime since 2019-01-21; recent 9-week mean demand \u224865.2 units/week. On-hand=49, in-transit=150 (total pipeline=199) which roughly covers ~3 weeks at current demand but below (L+1)=5 week coverage target. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I choose L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. For demand, use recent_N (N=9) to capture the sustained post-changepoint regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7recent mean so the backend increases target stock to cover 5 weeks of current demand. For volatility, use recent_N (N=9) so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices prioritize service (profit per unit = holding cost) while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=240. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5, and repeated P2\u2192P6 etc.), so stick with promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 28\u201334 and surrounding weeks) shows higher, more volatile weekly demand vs. early sample; to capture current regime use a recent-window mean. Chosen: L=default to keep promised 4; mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 8 demand samples and react to the recent regime; sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (cover recent elevated demand) against holding cost given current in-transit stock (240).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Current stock: on-hand=24, in-transit=267. Historical concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4 periods (observed repeatedly in conclude messages). Demand has been stable at a lower post-spike regime since late spring; recent weeks (last 12 concluded periods) show weekly demand roughly in the 34\u201397 range with mean around ~55\u201365. To reflect the confirmed LT=4 and recent demand regime, I use calculated lead time from observations and recent_N estimates (N=12) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets a base-stock tuned to current demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=18, in-transit=239. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods, so use the promised/default lead time. Recent demand (many weeks since Mar) has stabilized versus the early spike; to capture current mean/volatility I use recent samples to estimate demand across (1+L) review+lead periods. Choosing recent_N with N=20 balances responsiveness and sample size and aligns the pipeline target to current demand to trade off service level vs. holding costs.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Current on-hand 10 + in-transit 200. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show observed lead_time = 4 periods (stable across many orders), so use calculated lead time. Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21 and recent weeks show moderate weekly demand (roughly 40\u2013100). To focus the forecast on the current regime and recent volatility, I use recent_N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 12 demand samples. These choices keep service high given equal profit/holding costs while limiting excessive inventory by using recent demand stats rather than the long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent weekly demand has been consistently ~40\u2013100 units/week since the large regime shift in late Jan\u2013Feb 2019; current inventory = on-hand 59 + in-transit 195 = 254 units. Many past concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (matches promised). I therefore use promised/default lead time to keep pipeline timing aligned. To capture the elevated, stable post-changepoint demand I use a recent_N estimate for mu_hat (focus on the most recent 12 weeks to reflect current seasonality and recent variance) and mirror that for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These settings give the OR engine a forecast tuned to the current regime while using observed L=4 timing so orders neither understock nor create excessive holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=114, in-transit=145. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4; demand has been stable in recent months (~40\u201360/week). I set L to "calculate" to use observed lead-time average (captures confirmed 4-period lead time). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent stable regime and avoid overweighting the early Jan spike. Sigma uses recent_N N=12 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep base stock aligned to current demand while limiting excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand stable ~40-50 units/week (last 5 periods: 40,50,46,41,34; avg\u224842). On-hand=86, in-transit=156; promised lead time=4 and concluded history consistently shows 4-period actual lead time. No new sustained regime or lead-time change detected. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (consistent with observed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to focus the forecast on the recent stable regime and avoid older low-demand samples; sigma also recent_N (N=8) to capture recent variability. These parameters keep base-stock tied to current demand levels, limiting excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been stable in the 30\u201360 range over the past months; current on-hand=60, in-transit=165 (pipeline=225). Promised lead time=4 and concluded history consistently shows 4-period arrivals, so set L by calculating observed lead times. To focus the demand forecast on the current regime, use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the last ~20 weeks of demand, smoothing older jump in Jan). This yields a (1+L)-period forecast based on recent mean and corresponding recent volatility; it helps the OR backend set base-stock to cover the 5-period demand horizon while avoiding excess inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand regime since 2019-01-21 is elevated vs early samples; recent weekly demands (last many periods) are roughly 30\u201370 units. Current position: on-hand=87, in-transit=112 (pipeline present, no overdue unexplained gaps since lead time has been consistently 4). I set L to 'calculate' to lock to the empirically observed lead time (history repeatedly shows 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the latest stable regime (avoids early tiny-sample bias). These choices keep service high while limiting excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=115, in-transit=129 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand covers several weeks at current pace. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods, matching the promise. I set L=default to use promised/confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Many past shipments have consistently concluded with lead_time=4, so keep promised lead time. To keep the OR engine responsive to the recent lower/stable demand and avoid excess holding cost in holiday season, I use recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures ~2 months of recent behavior while meeting the N selection rule). L=default uses the promised 4-period lead time; recent_N for mu/sigma biases the base-stock toward current demand, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Promised lead time is 4 and recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4, so use promised L. Use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest stable regime (captures ~5 months of recent weekly demand without older Jan spike). This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of near-term demand) against holding cost by sizing base stock from recent demand mean and volatility rather than long-ago outliers.
