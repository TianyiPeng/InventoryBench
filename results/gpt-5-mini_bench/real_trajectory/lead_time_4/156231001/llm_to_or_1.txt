Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). SKU 156231001 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence. Demand history (5 weekly samples) shows mean \u2248180.2/week. With no changepoints or shipment info, use the promised lead time and default demand aggregation so the OR backend builds a base-stock covering (1+L) periods based on full-sample mean/variance. This keeps service coverage conservative given zero on-hand and no in-transit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand history (weekly samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04) shows mean \u2248180 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=228 (order placed Period 1 not yet concluded \u2014 consistent with promised lead time \u22651; insufficient evidence to change lead time). I will use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes base-stock from the full-sample mean and std. This keeps parameters conservative given the single overdue arrival and limited new data, while the existing in-transit units are available to the pipeline inventory calculation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25): historical weekly mean=180.2 (samples: 186,151,151,198,215). No concluded arrivals in Periods 1-2 (orders remain in-transit = 457) and promised lead time=4 cannot be validated yet. Use default lead time and demand estimators: (1+L)*mean captures the 5-period review+lead demand and default volatility preserves historical uncertainty. This balances service (covering multi-period demand) vs holding cost given profit=holding so no bias toward overstock without lead-time evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Historical weekly mean (Jan samples) = 180.2 units; recent observed demand (Periods 1-3) = [203,313,309], recent mean = 275.0, indicating a clear upward shift sustained 3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=750 equals total ordered (228+229+293) and is expected to arrive per promised lead time; no concluded arrivals yet so no confirmed lead-time change. I keep L as default (promised=4). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base_stock to improve service given rising demand while sigma estimate accounts for variability; keeping L=default avoids overreacting to non-concluded shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: recent mean (Periods 1-3) = 275.0 vs earlier sample mean = 180.2 (+52.8%), sustained for 3 periods (P1-P3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 P5. Recent demand elevated vs historical: recent demands (Periods1-4) = [203,313,309,235], recent mean \u2248 265. On-hand=0, in-transit=1128 (equals all outstanding orders). No arrivals have concluded yet so actual lead time cannot be confirmed; treat promised lead time as default. To reflect the sustained higher demand regime (3+ periods) I use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest pattern while keeping L at default to avoid overconfident lead-time changes. This balances service level (capture higher demand) against holding cost given large existing pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has been volatile: Periods 3-5 demands = 309, 235, 170; earlier Jan samples averaged ~180 but Periods 1-3 showed a temporary spike. On-hand=58, in-transit=1097 (large pipeline). One concluded arrival shows an observed lead time of 4 (Period1 order arrived in Period5). I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (confirms promised=4). For demand I use recent_N N=3 (last 3 realized demands) to capture the most recent regime (mean fell from initial spike). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the current short-term demand pattern while acknowledging confirmed lead time and the large existing pipeline to avoid over-ordering and high holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, observed lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=50, in-transit=903 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times: two observations both =4 \u2192 confirm LT=4. Recent demand samples (Periods1-3) show higher regime (avg\u2248275) vs earlier mean\u2248180; I therefore target the recent high-demand regime when sizing review+lead demand. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in confirmed LT=4. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to base (1+L)-period demand on the 3-period recent regime (captures the +53% shift). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (matching elevated recent demand) while the large in-transit reduces aggressive ordering; the OR backend cap will limit order size to control holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Confirmed actual lead time = 4 (observed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Recent demand regime shows higher demand vs historical baseline (carry-over insight recorded previously). On-hand =100, in-transit=727 (large pipeline covers multiple periods). To reflect confirmed LT=4 and the recent higher-demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N=3 for demand estimates (captures the sustained 3-period regime). This produces mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 3 demand samples, and sigma_hat computed from last 3 samples, which balances higher service needs against holding cost given a large existing pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent demand has shifted up (sustained high demand since Periods 5-8). Observed concluded lead times = 4 periods (consistent across multiple concludes). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 5-8) to capture the new higher regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting higher recent demand while the OR backend caps orders; minimizes stockouts given confirmed LT=4 and higher demand.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has been well above the historical 2019 sample mean: last 3 concluded periods demands = 243, 351, 286 (mean \u2248 293). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from prior concludes. Current inventory: on-hand=38, in-transit=783 (large pipeline). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set L based on observed lead times and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets safety for the most recent high-demand periods while the cap will limit excessive ordering given the large in-transit. This balances service (avoid stockouts during elevated demand) and holding cost (pipeline already heavy).

Recent realized demand (Periods 5-10 = 170,237,243,351,286,214) averages ~250/week, higher than earlier historical baseline; I therefore set L to be computed from observed lead times (confirmed = 4) and use recent_N=6 for demand mean/volatility so the OR engine targets the elevated regime and avoids understocking given the long lead time and large pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/29. On-hand=0, in-transit=1134. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders showed lead_time=4). Recent demand since the regime shift (noted in carry-over) is higher and volatile (periods 5-11 demands = 170,237,243,351,286,214,181). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime (use last 7 periods: P5\u2013P11) so mu_hat reflects current demand level across review+lead. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=7) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts given long confirmed LT and elevated demand) while letting the OR backend compute safety stock vs holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=48, in-transit=945 (ample pipeline). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift upward (noted earlier). I set L via 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time (all observed lead times =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (covering the most recent 8 demand periods since the regime shift) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current higher-demand regime while keeping variability estimated from the same recent window. This keeps service high given large pipeline while avoiding excessive holding by using recent demand stats.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=237, in-transit=760; promised lead time=4 and historical concludes consistently show lead_time=4. Pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers several weeks of demand but recent demand regime evidence motivates using most recent observations. Set L by calculating average observed lead times (confirmed=4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent regime (last 3 demand observations) so the OR engine targets current demand levels while limiting excess holdings given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent realized lead times are consistently 4 periods (confirmed in history), and current inventory is healthy: on-hand=415, in-transit=377. Recent demand (Periods 5-14) averages ~228 units/week; given promised lead time 4 and confirmed actual=4, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. To reflect the most recent demand regime I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat using the last 10 demand samples (Periods 5-14) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean based on current regime. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N with N=10 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock targeted to recent demand while acknowledging confirmed 4-period lead time and moderate on-hand + pipeline coverage, balancing service level and holding costs.

Demand since Period 5 is higher than the early-sample baseline; use recent data to capture the sustained higher regime. Set L via calculated average of observed lead times (matches confirmed 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 11 demand periods (Periods 5\u201315) to let the backend compute (1+L)-period demand and volatility, keeping service high while controlling holding cost given profit=holding cost parity.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=219, in-transit=764. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a prior demand regime uplift observed earlier; no new sustained changepoint in recent concluded demands. Given confirmed lead time equals promised and stable recent variability, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Recent demand has fallen versus the early spike; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 5 observed demands) to capture the current lower regime and reduce holding risk while meeting near-term demand. This balances service (use recent demand to size (1+L) forecast) against high holding cost ($1/unit/period).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=182, in-transit=694. Historic concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods (evidence in conclude messages P5-P17), so set lead time method to calculate (average observed = 4). Recent demand has softened vs the earlier high-regime: last 6 concluded demands (P13-P18) = [185,205,227,157,99,127] show a lower recent mean and reduced variability; use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the downturn while the calculate L preserves confirmed lead-time information; it balances service level against holding cost by reducing forecasted (1+L)-period demand and measured sigma to avoid excess inventory given holding cost = profit.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Recent realized lead times are consistently 4 (confirmed in history). On-hand=418 + in-transit=375 = 793 units; with long lead time we should use the confirmed LT and a demand estimate that reflects the most recent lower-demand regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in LT=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations, capturing the decline since the earlier high regime and avoiding overstocking given equal profit and holding cost.

Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; on-hand=633, in-transit=119. Recent demands have moderated versus the earlier high-regime signal, so I will use the promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates (use all historical samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=607, in-transit=244 (ample pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent runs). Recent demand has fallen (last weeks 53,53,30,9) versus early samples, but change is recent and not yet 3+ periods of sustained new regime beyond previously recorded shift. Use promised/confirmed lead time to keep alignment with observed arrivals and let OR backend compute demand aggregation from full sample set. Choosing default for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, balancing service level and holding cost given currently high on-hand inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=832, in-transit=32. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 repeatedly; recent demand has fallen sharply since mid-June (Periods 17-25: demands = 99,127,83,41,53,53,30,9,19) indicating a sustained low-demand regime. Pipeline + on-hand (864) already far exceeds short-term demand; to avoid excess holding cost, I use a lead time estimate derived from observed lead times and base my demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime (last 9 periods) so the OR backend will compute a smaller base stock. Choices: L set by calculating observed lead times (will be 4); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current low mean and reduced volatility. This reduces target base_stock and avoids over-ordering while maintaining service for near-term demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. Recent demand has collapsed vs earlier samples: last 9 periods (P18\u2013P26) average demand \u224855.4 units/week versus historical sample mean 180.2. On-hand=748 and in-transit=32 (total pipeline 780) \u2014 ample cover for multiple weeks at current pace. Promised lead time has been confirmed historically as 4; use default promised L to keep OR engine assumptions consistent. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (captures P18\u2013P26). This reduces target base-stock and caps orders, avoiding excessive holding cost while maintaining service. Sigma estimated from the same recent window to reflect lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 18: avg demand P18\u2013P26 = 55.4 vs earlier sample mean 180.2 (\u221269%), sustained 9 periods

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime from Period 18\u201326 (avg=55.4, 9 periods) though Period 27 spiked to 197; on-hand=551 + in-transit=32 = 583 units which is already large relative to the low regime. Use promised lead time (default) since lead time was previously confirmed as 4 and no new contradictory conclude messages appeared. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=9 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (use the 9-period regime 18\u201326) so the OR backend will size base-stock conservatively and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent history shows the long-run actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed P5/P6/etc.). Demand experienced a prolonged low regime from P18\u2013P26 (avg ~55) but the last two weeks (P27=197, P28=149) are only 2 periods \u2014 not yet a sustained changepoint. Current on-hand=402, in-transit=32 gives ample coverage; no evidence of lost shipments. Use lead-time estimate based on observed data (calculate) to keep alignment with confirmed LT=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample baselines) because the recent apparent rebound is not yet sustained (requires \u22653 periods) and we want stable forecast and variability estimates to balance service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime from Periods 18\u201326 (carry-over: avg 55.4) but demand has rebounded in P27\u2013P29 (197,149,114). On-hand=320 + in-transit=314 provides ample pipeline cover; observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. I set L via calculate to lock in the confirmed observed lead time (avg observed = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the most recent regime (Periods 18\u201326 length=9) so the forecast reflects the sustained low-demand period while still including the transition periods; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to align volatility with that same recent window. These choices keep target base-stock conservative against the recent low regime while allowing the OR backend cap to limit order size and avoid excess holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand 77, in-transit 314. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = promised 4 and a recent recovery in demand starting Period 27. Recent demand (Periods 27\u201330) averages ~175.8 units/week, so I focus forecasts on the most recent 4-week regime to reflect the recovery while keeping lead time at the promised/default. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=4) captures current demand level and volatility; default L keeps planning aligned with observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: demand recovered starting Period 27 \u2014 avg P27\u2013P30 = 175.8 vs prior low-regime avg P18\u2013P26 = 55.4 (sustained 4 periods).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=583. Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple P arrivals with lead_time=4), so use promised/default L. Demand recovered starting Period 27 (avg P27\u2013P31 \u2248195.4) after a low regime; recent demand is best predictor. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples P27\u2013P31) to capture the recovered higher mean and current volatility. This keeps base-stock sized for current demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-regime data; using default L ensures pipeline coverage for (1+L) review+lead period.

Promised lead time = 4 (previously confirmed by arrivals). Use L=default to keep promised lead time (backend expects 4). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=4) to capture the recovered regime (Periods 27\u201330) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of those recent samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of those recent samples; N=4 meets the regime-length rule and focuses orders on current demand to avoid overstock given already-large in-transit.

Recent demand recovered starting P27; last 7 periods (P27\u2013P33) show elevated and variable demand (mean \u2248247, large spike at P33). I use promised/confirmed lead time (default) and set demand parameters from the most recent regime to capture the recovery and higher variance: recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets service during the (1+L) review+lead window while accounting for recent volatility; large in-transit reduces immediate order pressure.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand has rebounded sharply since Period 31 (demands: P31=274, P32=255, P33=496, P34=358) indicating a sustained high-demand regime over the last 4 periods. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history; pipeline (in-transit=1235) is large while on-hand=0. I set L to default (promised 4) since concluded evidence matches promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 samples). For volatility I use recent_N N=4 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices focus the base-stock on the recent high-demand regime while relying on confirmed lead-time so orders aren't underplanned despite the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently observed = 4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Demand has experienced regime shifts earlier (notably a recovery starting P27) so I use a recent-window demand estimate. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4). For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the recovered higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline (1460 units); using recent demand reduces overreaction to older low-demand periods and the OR backend cap prevents excessive single-period orders.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand recovered to a higher regime since Period 27 (avg \u2248176) with large weekly spikes (multiple weeks 250\u2013500). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1156 (ample pipeline arriving per LT=4). To capture the current recovered demand regime I set L using observed lead times and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime data (last 10 periods, P27\u2013P36) so the OR backend sizes base stock for (1+L) review+lead demand and reflects recent mean and volatility while avoiding dilution by older low-demand periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand recovered to a higher, volatile regime since ~Period 27 (several large weeks: P33\u2013P37 demands 496,358,351,337,447). On-hand=0, in-transit=1166 (sufficient pipeline for multiple weeks). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. To reflect the recent high-demand regime and preserve service while pipeline is large, set L by calculation (observed lead time=4) and use recent_N (N=7) for demand mean and volatility (captures P31\u2013P37 recent behavior). This balances filling demand spikes while recognizing high in-transit inventory to avoid excessive additional ordering.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent history shows actual lead time = 4 (consistent concluded arrivals). On-hand=132 + in-transit=1228 => large pipeline inventory; pipeline comfortably covers multiple (1+L) periods of demand. Demand regime recovered around Period 27 with elevated/volatile weekly demand since (Periods 31\u201338 show large spikes and several stockouts). I keep L as default (use promised 4) because concluded lead-time observations are consistently 4. To capture the recent recovered/high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 demand samples (Periods 31\u201338) to reflect the current higher mean and volatility and avoid dilution by the earlier low-regime periods. This raises the backend base-stock and caps ordering to meet service while backend cap limits excess ordering despite large pipeline, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). Current inventory: on-hand=304, in-transit=1141 \u2014 pipeline is large so avoid inflating forecast. Demand regimes earlier shifted but recovered to ~historical mean from Period 27 onward; no new sustained changepoint in the last periods. Use lead-time estimate from observed data (calculate) and let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full history (default) so orders are sized by the established demand statistics while respecting the large existing pipeline to limit overstock given holding cost = profit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods (confirmed earlier) and demand recovered to the higher regime starting around Period 27 with elevated, volatile weekly demand since. On-hand=33, in-transit=1141 \u2014 pipeline is very large so avoid increasing target inventory beyond demand expectations. I use the promised/default lead time (4). For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the post-changepoint regime (most recent ~14 periods since Period 27) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher-demand, higher-volatility regime while the large in-transit position prevents aggressive ordering.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=1209 units. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand (P31\u2013P41) is elevated vs original 2019 samples. Large in-transit position (1209) already provides coverage for multiple (1+L) periods, so use default lead time and population-level demand/volatility estimates to let the OR engine compute base_stock and cap. This avoids over-ordering given the heavy pipeline and equal profit/holding (q=0.5).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand has returned to the higher regime that began at Period 27 (sustained). On-hand=42, in-transit=706 \u2014 pipeline large and recent arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (no evidence of lost shipments). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm actual=4). For demand I use a recent_N window covering the post-changepoint recovery (Periods 27\u201342, regime length 16) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recovered higher-demand regime and avoid dilution by the prior low regime. Using recent_N helps the OR backend size base stock for current higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts during high demand) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Recent demand (Periods 39\u201343) elevated and variable (recent five-period mean ~308) \u2014 capture this short-term regime for service while pipeline is large. Set L to promised/confirmed (default). Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime and volatility (keeps orders responsive to the late-season demand spike while the OR cap limits order size given high pipeline).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; I will use the promised/default lead time. To focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures P40\u2013P44). This keeps orders responsive to recent spikes while the large in-transit quantity limits new orders and reduces holding cost risk.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). History shows consistent observed lead times = 4 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4); pipeline = 1285, on-hand = 0. Recent demand has recovered and been volatile over the last several weeks (Period 41\u201345 demands: 285,461,200,367,468 with large spikes). I set L via 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current recovered, higher-volatility regime (uses last 5 demand samples) and reduce weight of earlier low-demand regime. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to raise base-stock to satisfy near-term high demand while the pipeline (1285) and L estimate are reconciled to avoid underordering given observed lead times and recent spikes.
