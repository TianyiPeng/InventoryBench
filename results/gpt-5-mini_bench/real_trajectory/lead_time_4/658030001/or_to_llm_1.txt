OR recommended 187 using promised L and historical stats; given high profit-to-holding ratio (q\u22480.95) the OR policy prudently targets high service. I will follow the OR quantity because: (a) we already have substantial pipeline (151) that OR accounted for, (b) last-period demand spike is notable but not yet sustained (insufficient evidence to declare a regime shift), and (c) profit is high so conservative stocking is preferable to risking lost sales.

{
  "rationale": "Confirmed actual lead time = 4 (history shows consistent 4-period arrivals). Current on-hand = 269, in-transit = 0. Promised policy should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Recent realized weekly demand has been low in December (Periods 41\u201345 demands = 44,48,17,27,15 \u2192 recent average \u224830/week), so 5-week expected demand \u2248150. On-hand 269 already comfortably covers 5-week demand plus safety stock implied by high profit/hurdle; placing OR's recommended 163 would push inventory to ~432, increasing holding cost without clear demand signal or incoming pipeline. No evidence of lost shipments currently (arrivals continue at 4-period lag). Therefore I order 0 to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining ample coverage for the 4-period lead time + current period demand.",
