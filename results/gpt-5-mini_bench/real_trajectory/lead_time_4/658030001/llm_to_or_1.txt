Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent raw weekly demands: [54,53,67,78,154] (mean=81.2). No concluded arrivals observed so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and default demand dispersion to let OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample statistics: this ensures coverage for (1+L) periods given current uncertainty while avoiding unsupported manual adjustments.

Period 2 (2019-02-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=151 from Period 1 order which has not concluded (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude) \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time yet. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show no sustained regime shift; no evidence of lost shipment beyond normal promised lead time. Use promised lead time and population-level demand estimates so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service (cover L+1 periods) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical weekly demand samples available (54,53,67,78,154). No concluded arrivals yet for recent orders and promised lead time is 4, so insufficient evidence to infer a lead-time change or demand regime shift. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, balancing service level against low holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=712 (sum of prior orders); no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time is 4 and in-transit confirms shipments exist (not lost), so keep L as default. Recent demand (Periods 1-4 conclude demands = 177,162,91,116) shows a sustained upward regime vs. older samples (2019-01 series mean ~81.2). I set mu_hat using recent_N to focus the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the latest 4 periods (N=4). Volatility also set to recent_N N=4 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices raise the base-stock to better cover higher recent demand while sigma based on recent variability keeps safety stock responsive to recent fluctuations, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit $19 vs holding $1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: recent 4-period avg=136.5 vs older sample mean~81.2 (+68%), sustained over 4 periods

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent demand regime (Periods 2-5) is higher: recent 4-period avg=136.5 vs older mean~81.2; sustained over 4 periods. On-hand=66, in-transit=679 provides ample pipeline but some past orders were delayed then first arrival confirmed lead_time=4. To reflect the detected higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=4). For L I use calculate to anchor on the observed lead_time=4 (backend will average observed lead times). These choices increase target base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated variability; using calculate for L lets the backend incorporate the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192arrived in P5, P2\u2192arrived in P6). On-hand=151, in-transit=492 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand = 643 units, which covers multiple periods vs expected demand. Demand context: historical sample mean=81.2 (samples: 54,53,67,78,154); recent periods show elevated demand but existing carry-over insight already records that shift. I set L via calculate to use observed lead-time evidence (average observed = 4). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7all-sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a conservative forecast anchored to full history while acknowledging observed lead time. This balances service (using confirmed L) against holding cost given large on-hand + in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1591.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 in observed conclues (orders from P1,P2,P3 arrived with W=4). Current on-hand=252 + in-transit=330 -> pipeline total 582, which already covers several weeks of demand at recent rates, so no need to inflate lead-time or demand forecast. Demand in the last 3 concluded periods: 85, 102, 97 (mean \u224894.7). I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (matches promised=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to anchor the (1+L) forecast to the most recent regime (three most recent demand observations) and reflect current lower post-spike demand. This keeps base_stock responsive to recent demand while avoiding overstock given substantial pipeline inventory and low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand regime shift detected at Period 5 (sustained); carry-over notes higher recent demand. Current on-hand 314 + in-transit 154 = 468 units\u2014ample cover versus typical weekly demand but demand regime remains elevated. Multiple concluded arrivals show realized lead time = 4 (orders P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time average. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the post-changepoint regime (focuses the base-stock on the elevated recent mean). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices align mu_hat and sigma_hat to the confirmed higher-demand regime while using the observed lead time to avoid underordering or excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8)

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand has been higher since Period 5 (sustained regime: P5\u2013P9 avg ~100+). On-hand=347, in-transit=110 covers multiple periods. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior conclues. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (periods 5\u20139) to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the base stock upward to preserve service level during the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check by using only recent data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Current on-hand=287, in-transit=182. Recent demand regime (from Period 5) is persistently higher; I use recent demand to forecast. I keep L as default (promised 4) because lead time was previously confirmed at 4 and no new contradictory concludes. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (periods 5-10) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; this focuses the base-stock on the new higher mean while increasing measured variability, improving service while limiting excess holding given current ample on-hand + pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=279, in-transit=198 (pipeline=477) which comfortably covers several weeks of recent demand. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead times (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P7->P11) so use observed average lead time. Demand showed a sustained post-Period-5 uplift earlier, but recent 4 weeks (P8-P11: 114,85,60,44) are lower; to be responsive to this recent regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (captures latest mean and volatility across the review+lead horizon). These choices (L=calculate, mu_hat recent_N N=4, sigma_hat recent_N N=4) let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances higher past demand with the more recent softening while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding excessive holding cost given large current pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Inventory on-hand=179, in-transit=213. Historical concluded lead-time observations all equal 4 periods \u2192 set L to calculated average (4). Recent demand (Periods 9-12 = 85,60,44,100) shows lower/volatile demand vs earlier spike; to avoid overstock given large pipeline, I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 4 periods (captures current lower regime and recent volatility). Using recent_N=4 down-weights the earlier spike and reduces ordering aggressiveness versus using full-sample defaults.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods (confirmed P1->P5 ... P4->P8). Recent demand (Periods 5-13) averages ~84 units/week; demand settled down after the earlier spike. On-hand=182, in-transit=201 provides healthy pipeline but demand now lower. Choose L=default to use promised/confirmed 4. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (most recent 9 demand observations) to capture current post-spike regime and reduce influence of older low/high outliers. This balances service (covers (1+L) periods of current demand) against holding cost by adapting mean/variance to recent stable demand.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Current on-hand 200 + in-transit 250 = 450 units, well above recent weekly demand (~60\u2013100+) so we are overstocked versus one-week demand; recent history confirms promised lead time = 4. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use the default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its capped ordering logic rather than increasing targets. Defaults let the backend use full historical sample statistics (including the post-Period-5 higher regime) while respecting the promised L=4 constraint.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=161, in-transit=353. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 and a demand regime shift observed starting Period 5 (sustained higher demand for 4+ periods). To capture the higher recent demand I use recent_N for demand estimates based on the post-changepoint regime (N=4). I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR backend on the higher recent mean and volatility, improving service while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit vs profit=$19/unit. No evidence of new lost shipments this period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has been in the higher regime detected at Period 5 (sustained elevated demand since P5). Current inventory: on-hand=114, in-transit=338. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 observations). I set L to default (promised lead time = 4) since concluded history matches the promise. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=12 (regime from Period 5 through Period 16 is 12 weeks) to capture the sustained higher mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=12 to reflect recent variability. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward the elevated demand level while relying on confirmed lead-time behavior to avoid under-ordering given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift since Period 5 (recent 4-period avg=136.5 vs older mean~81.2). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in conclude messages. Current on-hand=133 + in-transit=307 -> pipeline=440 units. To reflect the confirmed lead time I set L to 'calculate' (backend will compute average observed lead time = 4). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 (so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 demand samples) and match sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the OR engine target a base stock sized to the elevated recent demand while using observed lead time, balancing higher service level against holding cost given current ample pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (higher mean sustained through current period). On-hand=207, in-transit=186 (pipeline=393) \u2014 ample coverage but some in-transit arrivals may still be delayed historically; lead time has been observed as 4. I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=14) to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (avg computed over the last 14 samples, (1+L) scaling applied by backend). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=14) so the OR engine sizes safety stock to recent variability. These choices align the base-stock to the new higher-demand regime while acknowledging confirmed L=4 and avoiding overstating demand from older low-demand samples.

A sustained demand regime shift was detected earlier (higher mean after Period 5) and recent realized demands from Periods 5\u201319 (15 samples) better represent current demand. I set L to the promised/default lead time to keep alignment with observed confirmations. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 to capture the post-shift demand regime (reduces bias from older low-demand samples) so the OR engine sizes base stock to meet current elevated demand while controlling holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Current on-hand=301 + in-transit=141 provides ample coverage for (1+L) demand; no evidence of lost shipments. Use default lead time to keep model aligned with contract (promised L=4). Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects long-run demand while the cap will limit excessive ordering and control holding costs (profit $19 vs holding $1 favors service but prevents runaway inventory).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Current on-hand=298, in-transit=228 (total pipeline=526). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and there is no new sustained changepoint in demand since prior recorded shift (no 3+ period change recently). Pipeline comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand under historical averages. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) to align with confirmed lead-time evidence and avoid overreacting to short-term noise. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat at default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L), providing a stable base-stock estimate that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost without overfitting recent variability or risking stockouts from transient dips/spikes.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand regime (detected at Period 5) persists: last sustained uplift vs older baseline. On-hand=261, in-transit=254 => pipeline=515 units, ample cover vs (1+L) demand. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history. To respect the sustained higher demand regime while avoiding excess ordering given large pipeline, I use default promised lead time and set demand estimates from the recent regime (most recent changepoint length=4). Methods chosen: L default (promised=4) so OR backend uses contractual lead time; mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to target (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 4 demand samples (captures the higher recent mean); sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This balances a high service-level objective (profitably high fill target) against holding costs given already-large on-hand + in-transit.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). Recent demand has been moderate (historic samples show a sustained higher regime detected earlier around Period 5) and current on-hand=299 with in-transit=182. Historical concluded lead times repeatedly equal promised 4 periods, and no new evidence of lost shipments. Given ample on-hand + pipeline (~481 units) versus recent weekly demands (~30-100 range) I keep the promised lead time and use default demand statistics so the OR backend applies the long-run sample mean/variance (1+L horizon). This balances service (high profit/unit relative to holding cost) with inventory costs by letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and capped order accordingly.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=323, in-transit=199. Historical conclues confirm lead time = promised 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 5 (recent 4-period avg=136.5 vs older mean~81.2). To protect service level given the higher regime and multi-period lead time, use promised lead time and compute demand stats from the recent regime: select recent_N=20 to capture the post-Period-5 regime (covers available recent history up to Period 24). This raises the forecasted review+lead demand and volatility, increasing base-stock to reduce stockouts while holding costs remain low (holding=$1 vs profit=$19).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05): recent history shows the demand regime shift first detected in Period 5 has persisted; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand = 424, in-transit = 81 (ample on-hand coverage). To capture the sustained post-changepoint demand statistics I use recent_N (N=20) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the current regime; L uses default (promised) which matches observed lead time and keeps OR engine assumptions consistent.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Current on-hand=350, in-transit=55. Recent demand shows a single high week (Period 26 demand=100) but no new sustained regime change; historical lead times repeatedly observed as 4 periods. To remain conservative and consistent with confirmed lead time and overall historical demand, use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to one high week while respecting the confirmed L=4 evidence.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=184 + in-transit=175 => pipeline=359 units. Promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show LT=4. Demand regime increased earlier (Period 5) and recent months remain elevated and more volatile; to reflect recent regime and capture current higher average demand while still using observed LT, I set L to default (use promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 8 demand observations (captures the sustained higher mean and recent volatility). This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent high demand) against holding cost by not over-weighting very old low-demand samples.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Recent demand has been in the higher regime detected at Period 5 and sustained since; lead time has been consistently observed as 4. On-hand=106, in-transit=220 (pipeline sufficient but demand remains elevated). Use promised/default lead time to keep OR backend aligned with supplier promise. For demand forecast use recent_N to focus on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use N=20 to capture recent 20 weeks). Use recent_N volatility to reflect recent variability. These settings bias orders toward the higher recent mean while keeping variability measured from recent history so the capped-order constraint moderates extreme ordering and limits holding cost exposure.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=1, in-transit=349. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). A sustained demand regime shift was detected at Period 5 (recent 4-period avg=136.5 vs older mean~81.2, +68%) and has persisted; recent demand has been substantially above legacy mean. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed average lead time (matches confirmed 4). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the new, higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 samples). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This approach keeps target base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand, while acknowledging lead-time evidence and avoiding overreaction to single-period spikes. With on-hand virtually zero vs large pipeline, these parameters focus orders to replenish expected throughput over the review+lead period and balance service level versus holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=467 (large pipeline arriving in future). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand has been elevated: last 4 realized demands (Periods 27-30) = [166, 133, 105, 167], recent avg \u2248 142.8, supporting a higher forecast than older samples. I set L to default (promised lead time 4) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 4. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime (N=4 equals the recent sustained elevated periods). These parameters focus ordering on recent demand to avoid understocking given current zero on-hand and large in-transit, while sigma reflects recent volatility to balance service vs holding costs.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=539 \u2014 large pipeline but no visible same-period arrivals yet. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use promised/default lead time to align with OR engine. Recent demand has stepped up: last 5 concluded weekly demands = [166,133,105,167,178], recent mean ~149.8. To capture this regime shift and reduce stockouts, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while keeping variability estimated from the newest regime; default L lets the OR backend apply its lead-time assumption and cap logic given steady observed 4-period arrivals.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=639 \u2014 pipeline is large and will cover many upcoming periods, so do not inflate lead time or demand unnecessarily. Use promised lead time (default) since observed concluded lead times consistently equal 4. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting noise from older low-demand samples; this biases the base-stock toward current demand and keeps safety stock responsive to recent volatility.

On-hand=0, in-transit=510 which currently covers several weeks of expected demand but may deplete given high recent demand. I retain promised lead time (default) and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime so the OR engine raises base stock to protect service while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4 periods, so use promised lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime (sustained over the last several weeks) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) so the OR backend builds a base-stock reflecting the current elevated mean and measured volatility while the pipeline covers upcoming demand. This balances service level (reduce stockouts) vs holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=101, in-transit=637 (pipeline=738). Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 5; recent weeks remain volatile but elevated (e.g., P31-35 demands: 178,138,213,123,91). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. I keep L as default (use promised 4). To capture the sustained post-changepoint higher mean while weighting recent variability, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the recent regime while smoothing short spikes). Sigma_hat left as default to let backend compute variability over all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to maintain service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline and elevated demand) while not overstating volatility to the OR engine.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=231, in-transit=437 gives ample pipeline but recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. I set L using 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time data rather than blindly trusting promise. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to weight the OR engine toward the post-changepoint, higher-demand regime while smoothing noise; N=20 captures the sustained elevated demand since the regime shift without overreacting to single spikes. These choices raise the base-stock (improving service under higher demand) while the sigma estimate increases safety stock; this balances profit-driven service level against low holding cost ($1/unit) given current healthy pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5; observed lead time confirmations all equal promised 4. Current inventory: on-hand=158, in-transit=439 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=597 which covers multiple (1+L)=5 review+lead periods at current demand levels, but we must keep safety for variability. Set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent sustained regime (regime length >20) and reduce influence of early low-demand samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent variability. These choices bias orders toward recent, higher mean demand while letting the OR backend compute service-level buffer using profit/holding tradeoff (high q\u22480.95 \u2192 modest safety stock).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=299, in-transit=302. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand regime has been higher and more volatile since Period 5; to capture the sustained higher demand I use recent samples rather than the full-sample mean. Using L=default (promised 4) keeps consistency with observed lead time and OR backend assumptions while mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N to reflect the elevated recent demand and variance so the base-stock will raise service stock without overcommitting long-term inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Demand regime has been higher since Period 5 (sustained); historical lead time observations consistently show 4 periods. Current available stock (on-hand 454 + in-transit 158 = 612) is ample versus recent weekly demand but we must respect L+1 coverage. Choose L by using promised/observed lead time (stable at 4). For demand forecast (mu_hat) use recent_N to focus on the sustained higher regime; pick N=20 to capture the most recent 20 samples within the high-demand regime, giving the backend a (1+L)-scaled mean that reflects the elevated demand. For sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to capture recent volatility and avoid underestimating risk. These choices keep service high during the confirmed higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding by using recent regime stats rather than older, lower-demand history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=388, in-transit=228. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4; no new overdue/lost shipments. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime since Period 5; to reflect the higher recent demand and reduce stockout risk given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1), I use recent data to set forecast mean and volatility. Choosing recent_N with N=20 balances responsiveness to the sustained higher regime while smoothing noise; this increases service level while keeping holding cost moderate.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). SKU shows high on-hand (346) + in-transit (295) = 641 units, well above typical recent weekly demand; confirmed historical actual lead time = 4. Profit/holding implies high target service level (~95%). Given confirmed lead time and abundant pipeline, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend (which knows promised L=4) computes base-stock conservatively from full-sample mean/variance. This avoids unnecessary extra ordering while preserving service level.

No recent sustained demand regime change beyond the previously recorded shift (Period 5). Pipeline + on-hand currently ample vs recent weekly demand, so follow promised lead time and let the OR engine compute demand forecasts from full history. Choices: L=default to use promised 4-period lead time (confirmed); mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend uses all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to balance service level (profit-driven q) against holding cost given current ample inventory.

Current on-hand=437 and in-transit=154 provide substantial coverage; nevertheless demand regime shifted up early (Period 5) and remains elevated vs initial samples. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent demand statistics to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine raises the base stock appropriately while keeping L at the promised value the OR engine expects.

Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 5; to capture the post-changepoint demand level I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=20 (balances recent high-demand data while smoothing noise). Volatility uses default sigma to let the OR engine compute uncertainty from full history. This keeps service high given low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 5 (recent weeks much higher than earliest samples) and actual lead time consistently observed = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=534, in-transit=111 (pipeline ample for near term). I set L via 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead-time history rather than blindly trusting the promise. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained post-changepoint regime while smoothing shorter-week noise; N=20 is chosen because the regime has persisted for many periods (use max cap 20). This keeps the OR backend's base stock tuned to the higher, sustained demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; using observed lead time prevents under-ordering if actual lead time deviated earlier. Given high on-hand + pipeline, these parameters allow the backend to size orders conservatively to balance the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

No sustained new demand or lead-time changepoint since prior insights. To keep OR backend aligned with promised lead time and historical demand, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean and std. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while preserving service-level via backend's capped ordering.
