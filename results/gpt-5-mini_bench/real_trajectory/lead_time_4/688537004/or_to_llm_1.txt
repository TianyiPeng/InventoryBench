OR computed a capped order of 124 by applying a cap that limits per-period order volatility; that cap leaves the 5-period expected demand substantially under-covered (124 << 245). Decision rule: because there is zero pipeline and the expected 5-period demand is 245, I will order to cover the expected mean demand over the review+lead horizon to avoid predictable stockouts when lead time is long. Risk tradeoff: holding cost equals profit, but failing to cover expected demand simply guarantees lost sales; the sensible action is to bring pipeline up to the mean demand over L+1 periods.
