Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent historical weekly demand (5 samples from Jan\u2013early Feb) shows mean \u2248 153.8 units/week. No on-hand or in-transit and no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unknown; follow promised lead time. Use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters grounded in full-sample history while avoiding overreaction to limited data and ensures orders cover the review+lead horizon.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=218 (ordered Period 1). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence to change lead time or demand regime. Use default lead time and default demand estimates based on all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock calculation aligned with historical weekly demand and avoids overreacting to a single outstanding shipment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded periods show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-2 (possible delay), but insufficient evidence to change lead time (need 3+ periods of consistent arrival info). Historical demand samples (124,168,190,183,99) give mean\u2248152.8 and std\u224839.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=429 (provides coverage vs. forecast). Use promised lead time default and population-based demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies the standard (1+L) scaling while we wait for definitive lead-time signals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand history (samples provided) shows mean \u2248152.8/week; using default methods keeps (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to let OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent weekly demand samples (124,168,190,183,99) average ~152.8 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=739 but no concluded arrivals for any orders (Periods 1-4 orders all show arrived=0), suggesting shipments are delayed/lost beyond the promised 4-period lead time. To be conservative, I estimate a longer effective lead time to force the OR engine to cover more pipeline demand and avoid stockouts: set L explicit=6. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all historical samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (higher base stock) against holding cost given profit=holding, and accounts for suspected lost/delayed shipments by lengthening lead time.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-4 (218,211,210,100 units) have not arrived by Period 5 conclude (arrived=0) \u2014 suggests lost or persistently delayed shipments beyond promised 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-52.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concludes show the P1 order (218) arrived in Period 5, implying observed lead time = 4 (matches promised). Current inventory: on-hand=135, in-transit=721. Historical sample mean demand = 152.8 (5 samples). Given confirmed LT=4 and no clear demand regime shift, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps forecasts aligned with long-run history while the OR engine handles service/holding tradeoff; defaults also hedge against transient missed-arrival noise while we gather more concluded lead-time evidence.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order placed P1 arrived in P5 => LT=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=211, in-transit=510. Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6). Demand recent series (last 6 periods: 112,169,136,123,83,135) shows no sustained regime shift; use recent 6-sample estimates to capture latest demand level and variability. Set L via 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (will reflect confirmed LT=4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=6 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from latest 6 demand observations, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost ($1/$1). This keeps forecast responsive to the recent dip (period 5) while respecting confirmed lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=331, in-transit=300. Observed lead times from concluded history are consistently 4 periods for recent arrivals, so use an inferred lead time. Demand history (Periods 1\u20137) shows no sustained abrupt regime shift; use recent data to capture current mean/variance. Select L by 'calculate' to reflect observed LT=4. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=7 (all available recent periods) so the (1+L) demand forecast reflects the latest demand mix. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 to capture current volatility. These choices keep service high by sizing base stock from recent demand while letting the backend cap limit orders to avoid excessive holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent observed arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (orders P1-P4 all arrived with LT=4). Current on-hand=330 + in-transit=200 = 530 units. Demand has trended down vs. the older 2019-Jan samples (historical sample mean 152.8 for Jan series vs. recent periods mean \u2248119), so I use a recent-sample demand estimate to capture the lower recent regime. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed LT=4. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 8 demand observations (periods 1\u20138) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and empirical volatility from the current regime. This balances service (respecting confirmed LT and recent demand) against holding cost by reducing reliance on older higher-demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-396.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent realized demand (Periods 5-9) averages ~95 units/week (83,135,90,101,67) which is materially below the older 5-sample historical mean (~153). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from concluded arrivals (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). To reflect the recent lower demand regime while using confirmed LT=4, I set L by calculating observed lead times and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 periods (Periods 5-9) to capture the current regime. This reduces overstock risk versus using the older, higher historical mean. Sigma is also estimated from the same recent 5-period window to reflect current volatility. These choices help the OR engine target an appropriate base-stock that balances service level and holding cost given confirmed LT=4 and lower recent demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (orders P1\u2013P4 arrived with LT=4). On-hand=401, in-transit=64 => pipeline_inventory=465 which comfortably covers multiple weeks of recent demand (weekly mean \u2248152.8). No evidence of a persistent demand regime shift; demand samples remain consistent with historical mean/variance. Given promised LT=4 matches observed, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost when profit=holding cost ($1/$1) (q=0.5 -> neutral z), avoiding unnecessary extra inventory while preserving service.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P5 arrived with LT=4). On-hand=308, in-transit=213; pipeline looks healthy. Demand has fallen from earlier highs (2019-02 samples ~125\u2013190) to lower recent weekly demand (last 5 periods demands = 90,101,67,62,93 -> mean\u224882.6). To adapt to the new lower demand regime while respecting confirmed LT=4, set L via observed average, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples (N=5) to capture current mean/volatility and reduce excess holding. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). On-hand=151, in-transit=213; no currently outstanding evidence of lost shipments. Demand history (weekly samples) has mean ~152.8. I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) and holding cost given confirmed LT and stable demand samples.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). History shows multiple concluded arrivals consistently indicating actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1-P11 that later concluded all show LT=4). On-hand=108, in-transit=324. To align backend assumptions with observed LT, set L using calculate (average observed LT=4). Demand has been moderate recently (periods 10-15 demands: 62,93,157,83,71,102) so I use a recent_N estimate to capture the current regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last N=5 demand samples to reflect the recent demand level and volatility, giving the OR engine a fresher forecast while still using the confirmed lead-time. This balances service (profit=holding => target service quantile = 0.5) against holding cost by relying on recent demand and confirmed LT rather than older samples potentially from a different regime.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=12, in-transit=398. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and no recent sustained demand regime shift; shipments from earlier periods resolved to match LT=4. I keep L at the promised/confirmed lead time and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean/std. This balances service (use full history since no new regime) against holding cost given profit=holding so z* = 0.5 service target.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10): On-hand=24, in-transit=381. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods for concluded orders (multiple P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Earlier missing arrivals (P1\u2013P4 initially unobserved) have since concluded and do not indicate persistent loss now. I set L to 'calculate' to use the observed average lead time (confirmed = 4) rather than the promise. Demand and variability appear stable across the provided historical samples, so I use default pooling for mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to let the OR engine compute base_stock and cap using full-sample statistics. This balances service (observed LT=4) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17): recent demand has risen and become more variable (recent demands: ... ,96,177,201 over Periods 15-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (covers some upcoming demand but arrivals will be visible only next period). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. I set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in the confirmed LT=4. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the upward demand regime evident since ~Period 11-12 so the forecast reflects the higher recent mean across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=10 to reflect increased recent volatility; this raises safety stock and balances the equal profit and holding costs (q=0.5), improving service while controlling inventory given possible lost/delayed shipments.

Recent demand has been high (periods with demand up to ~200) and last conclude shows demand=203 with no on-hand. Given confirmed LT=4 and no sustained demand regime shift requiring manual override, use computed average lead time and let backend compute demand across (1+L) review+lead window. Default sigma lets backend use full-sample volatility. This balances service vs holding given profit=holding (q\u22480.5) without overreacting to short gaps or isolated missing arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=644. Recent history shows a sustained increase in demand starting Period 17 (demands: 177,201,203,216,233). Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods in concluded messages. To capture the new high-demand regime I set L by calculate (to confirm observed LT=4 from history) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (last 5 demand observations) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability under the new regime while respecting replenishment cap constraints.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17: avg demand (P17-21)=206.0 vs earlier baseline mean (historical sample set)=152.8 (+35%), sustained for 5 periods.

For demand I use recent_N over the new regime to capture the higher mean/volatility (N=6 covers Periods 17-22). This raises base_stock to meet higher service needs while sigma recent_N captures increased variability; parameters balance profit vs holding cost by sizing stock to the confirmed higher demand regime while relying on observed lead time.

On-hand=0, in-transit=840 (covers several incoming arrivals). I set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (confirmed LT=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the post-Period-17 high-demand regime (use last 7 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=7 to capture increased variability in the same recent window. These choices bias orders toward higher coverage for the new, sustained higher demand while using observed lead time so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 17 (P17-24 recent samples: 177,201,203,216,233,263,164,109; mean=195.75). On-hand=0, in-transit=965 which roughly matches (1+L)\xd7recent mean \u22485\xd7195.75=978.75, so pipeline nearly covers expected demand. Historical concludes consistently show 4-period actual lead time (orders observed arriving after 4 periods). I therefore set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (N=8 = P17\u2013P24). These parameters align the OR backend's base-stock calculation with the confirmed higher demand while acknowledging existing in-transit coverage to avoid unnecessary extra ordering and reduce holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 17 (avg\u2248206) vs earlier baseline \u2248153. On-hand=136, in-transit=720 \u2014 ample pipeline but must account for confirmed 4-period lead time. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (confirmed LT=4 across many concludes). Demand forecast uses a recent_N window to capture the post-Period-17 regime: mu_hat recent_N N=9 (captures Periods 17\u201325 demand to reflect elevated mean). Volatility likely shifted with the regime; set sigma_hat recent_N N=9 to reflect recent variability. These choices bias base-stock upward to reduce stockouts under the new higher-demand regime while relying on pipeline to limit excess holding.

No new sustained demand regime change since the previously recorded shift; recent demand variability continues. Use calculated lead time to lock in the observed LT=4, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the full-sample statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 17 (avg P17-21=206 vs historical 152.8). On-hand=439, in-transit=298 => pipeline total=737, so we currently have healthy coverage. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; I use calculated L to reflect confirmed observed LT. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (Periods 17 onward). Using recent_N updates the OR engine's base-stock to match elevated mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given current high on-hand/pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent history shows observed lead times consistently 4 periods (many concluded arrivals: orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6,...). Demand had a spike in P17-21 but then softened; the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 24-28: 109,123,106,96,57) indicate a lower recent mean. To be responsive to the current lower-demand regime while preserving service over the 1+L review+lead window, I set L by calculating from observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std. This reduces overstock risk given holding cost equals profit and current sizable on-hand (583) + in-transit (220).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02): observed concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods for multiple orders (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P25\u2192P29). Current inventory: on-hand=510, in-transit=206 (pipeline=716). With promised L=4 and confirmed LT=4, no evidence of new sustained demand regime change since prior carry-over notes; recent weekly demand has varied but not persistently above prior regime. To avoid overreacting to short-term noise and because on-hand + pipeline already covers multiple periods ((1+L)=5), use calculated lead time (average observed =4) and default demand estimates (use full-sample mean/variance scaled by 1+L). This keeps the OR backend\u2019s base-stock grounded in long-run stats and prevents excess ordering given high current inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=449, in-transit=123. Concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders in P1..P30 that arrived indicate LT=4). Demand regime shift noted earlier (P17-21 higher mean) is already recorded; recent periods (P25-P30) show demand back to moderate levels. I set L=calculate to lock in the observed average lead time (4) so the OR backend uses realized LT rather than merely promised. I choose default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively\u2014this balances service level (captures the confirmed LT and full-sample mean) against holding cost given current large on-hand stock and in-transit. No adjustments for missing shipments are needed now since shipments have consistently concluded with LT=4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=324, in-transit=212. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Demand regime shifted starting Period 17: avg demand P17-21 = 206 vs earlier baseline ~153 (+35%), and this elevated demand persists through recent periods. To capture confirmed LT=4 while letting the backend compute from observed lead times, set L using 'calculate'. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, use recent_N for demand forecast and volatility with N=15 (Periods 17\u201331) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new mean and variability. This raises base stock to preserve service during the longer, higher-demand regime while the capped order cap limits extreme ordering and controls holding cost.

On-hand=348, in-transit=321 provides substantial pipeline but demand remains elevated. I set L=calculate to lock in observed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (Periods 17-32) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Sigma uses recent_N N=16 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher cover for the new regime while using observed lead time to avoid underordering given delayed arrivals earlier.

For demand I choose recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-change regime while smoothing short noise (uses last 10 demand samples). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago baseline.

Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=509. Historical history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (avg P17-21=206 vs baseline 152.8) and confirmed consistent 4-period actual lead time in concluded messages. Recent demand (Periods 31-35 = 125,99,201,158,137) averages 144, indicating demand remains above the original small-sample baseline but below the P17-21 spike. To balance service and holding costs (profit=holding cost), I conservatively base forecasts on the most recent 5 weeks to capture current pace while avoiding overreaction to earlier spike. I therefore use promised lead time (default), recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect current realized demand, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This keeps pipeline targets aligned with observed arrivals (which have been 4-period) and uses recent variability to size safety stock without overstocking given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). History shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods for concluded orders; earlier missing shipments resolved and do not persist. Demand regime shift detected starting Period 17 (sustained higher mean through Period 36). On-hand=121 + in-transit=485 provides coverage but demand elevated\u2014so increase forecast using recent regime data. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 17\u201336). This raises base-stock to protect service under higher demand while sigma_hat from recent variability ensures safety stock; using observed L lets the OR backend compute correct (1+L) scaling.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 17 (noted earlier: avg P17-21 = 206 vs baseline ~153, sustained). Current inventory: on-hand=82, in-transit=550 (pipeline ample but arrivals are observed with a 1-period conclude delay). Historical concluded lead times consistently equal 4 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average (confirmed LT=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-change higher-demand regime (regime length >20 \u2192 cap N=20), so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 20 demands reflecting the sustained higher demand. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service (covering (L+1) periods of elevated demand) while limiting excess safety stock by using recent-regime stats rather than all-history dilution.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with LT=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=551 (sizable pipeline). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 17 (avg P17-21=206 vs historical mean 152.8, sustained). To respect the confirmed LT and capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times, and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent regime data. I choose recent_N with N=20 (regime length >20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated demand while smoothing older baseline data; this balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Demand regime shift reported earlier (start P17) persists; recent demands remain elevated vs early baseline. To hedge stockouts while capping excess holding cost (profit=holding), I keep promised lead time (4) and use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime. Choices: L default to use promised lead time=4; mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent sustained regime; sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=105, in-transit=506. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; no current evidence of additional lost shipments. Recent demand (last 5 conclude periods: P36-40 demands = 111,121,208,98,103) shows a lower mean than mid-year spike, so I use a short recent window to capture the current lower-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to bias the OR engine toward current observed demand and reduce excess holding given holding cost = profit. These parameters balance service (covering L+1 review periods with recent mean) versus holding cost by shrinking forecast to current demand levels.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Demand experienced a sustained higher-regime since Period 17 (historic mean up ~+35%); lead time has been consistently observed at 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=187, in-transit=389 (pipeline adequate vs. (1+L) demand but recent higher demand motivates using recent demand window). Choose L=default to use promised lead time (promised=4, confirmed by history). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the latest 20 demand observations to capture the higher regime while smoothing noise. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to raise the base stock for the sustained higher-demand regime while using recent volatility to size safety stock and avoid excess holding.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=184, in-transit=350 \u2014 pipeline sizable but demand remains elevated. I set L to "calculate" so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed = 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Period-17 higher demand regime while smoothing older low-demand samples; N=20 caps the recent regime window per rules. These choices increase forecasted (1+L)-period demand and its variability to raise target base-stock and reduce stockouts under the confirmed LT=4, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding so target service level will be moderate.

I use L default (promised=4). For demand I use recent_N to capture the sustained higher-regime mean using the most recent regime length (capped at 20) -> N=20. Sigma uses default (backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). Current on-hand (325) + in-transit (232)=557, which the OR backend will compare to the (1+L)-period demand forecast to balance service vs holding costs.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning Period 17 (noted in carry-over). To capture the higher recent demand, set lead time to default (promised=4) and use recent_N demand estimates over the most recent 20 periods to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting noise.

Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (many orders: P1->P5, P2->P6, ...), so use calculated lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=20) for demand mean and volatility (captures the most recent ~20 periods since the shift while limiting noise). These parameters raise target base-stock to protect service during the higher-demand regime while sigma from recent data keeps safety stock responsive and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent demand has retreated from the mid-200s regime (Period 17-22) and the last 5 concluded periods show low weekly demand (Periods 42-46 demands = 110,49,67,65,51; recent mean ~68) and reduced volatility. On-hand=302 + in-transit=199 provides strong cover vs near-term demand; historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time=4. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead-time confirmations. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the OR forecast on the current low-demand December regime so the backend will reduce order targets and avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service over the (1+L) review+lead window.
