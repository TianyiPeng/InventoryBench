Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand sample series shows an upward trend (59,78,96,123,144) but only 5 historic samples and no arrival/conclude history yet. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, and promised lead time=4. No evidence of lost or shortened shipments. I choose default lead time to trust the promise, and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This is conservative given limited data and the observed upward trend will be captured by the full-sample mean while avoiding overfitting to the small recent sample. Defaults balance service level vs holding cost until we observe concluded arrivals or a sustained regime shift.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent observed demand has trended upward (historical samples: 59,78,96,123,144 and Period 1 demand=107). On-hand=0, in-transit=157 (order placed in Period 1 not yet concluded \u2014 expected given promised lead time=4). No concluded arrivals observed to infer actual lead time or a sustained regime change (need \u22653 periods of consistent evidence). To avoid overfitting to a short-term trend and because promised lead time remains the only confirmed LT signal, use default settings so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history while accounting for the promised lead time and pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=309. Two recent orders (Periods 1\u20132) show arrived=0 (possible delays) but this is only 2 periods of missing arrivals\u2014insufficient to confirm a lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) and demand estimates anchored to all historical samples (mean ~100/wk over provided 5 samples) so the OR backend computes base-stock and caps consistently. This balances service level (use full-history mean) while flagging that shipments may be delayed; if delays persist, update L in future periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=456. Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded yet but promised lead time=4 means we cannot infer actual lead time from absence of arrivals; no concluded arrivals exist to compute a different L. Recent observed demand in-game (Periods1-3: 107,75,52) plus historical samples (Jan weekly series) show no confirmed sustained regime shift. To avoid overfitting to short recent noise and because lead time evidence is insufficient, use default methods so the OR engine applies the promised L and full-sample demand stats. This balances service level versus holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=459. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods1-4) = [107,75,52,66] (mean ~75) while earlier historical samples (Jan) show higher seasonality; promised lead time is 4. Multiple recent orders have not yet concluded but this is within the promised lead-time window so do not mark shipments lost. Use default lead time (promised L=4) so backend uses full-sample mean for (1+L) review+lead demand; use default sigma to reflect full-sample variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline) against holding cost by letting OR compute base stock from observed long-run stats while accounting for promised L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-47.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent observed demand (Periods 1-5) averages 71 units/week (107,75,52,66,55), down from historical sample mean 100 (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04). On-hand=102, in-transit=302 (matches orders placed in P2-P4), and Period 5 conclude confirmed an order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=4 -> actual lead time confirmed at 4. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed=4). For demand, I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime from the last 5 periods so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses recent volatility (recent_N N=5). This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given confirmed LT and current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from historical mean 100 (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) to recent mean 71 (Periods 1-5: 107,75,52,66,55), decrease \u2248 -29%; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand (Periods 1-5) shows a lower regime: mean=71 units/week (107,75,52,66,55). On-hand=196, in-transit=150; confirmed arrivals from P1 and P2 with lead_time=4. To reflect the confirmed lead time and recent lower demand, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to focus the forecast and variability on the latest regime. This reduces target base-stock to match the ~29% demand drop and avoids excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-233.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand (Periods 1-5) shows a lower regime: {107,75,52,66,55} mean=71 vs historical mean\u2248100. Lead time observed in concluded messages is consistently 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). On-hand=288, in-transit=3; inventory is ample vs recent demand so risk of stockout is low, focus is on avoiding excess holding. Set L via calculate to use observed lead times=4. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new lower-demand regime over the review+lead horizon. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to match the lower recent mean and reduce unnecessary replenishment given high on-hand inventory, balancing service and holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=227, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders from P1-P4 arrived at P5-P8). Recent demand (Periods1-5 = 107,75,52,66,55) indicates a sustained downshift versus historical mean (~100) \u2192 use recent data. Choose L by calculating observed lead times; set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 periods to capture the new lower regime and recent variance. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods with reduced mean) against holding cost given current high on-hand.

Lead time observed consistent with promised 4 periods (Period1\u2192P5). To reflect the recent lower-demand regime and preserve service while avoiding extra holding cost, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility over the current regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand regime is lower than historical (sustained drop beginning Period 6). On-hand=132 + in-transit=109 => pipeline 241 units, which is ample vs. reduced recent demand. Lead time confirmed as 4 from concluded arrivals, so use calculated lead time. To capture the new lower regime, set demand forecasts using the most recent regime (last 5 periods) for both mu and sigma (recent_N, N=5). This keeps target base-stock aligned with the lower recent mean and reduces excess holding cost while preserving service level under confirmed L=4.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand has declined versus historical (recent periods trending ~50-75/week). On-hand=94 + in-transit=140 provides coverage but demand trend is lower than 2019-Jan samples. Lead time has been observed as 4 periods repeatedly so use observed average. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the new lower demand regime (last 5 demand samples capture the downturn) so the OR backend lowers base stock and reduces holding cost while preserving service.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent demand has declined materially vs. historical (carry-over noted: recent mean \u224871 vs historical 100) and latest five periods show a further lower regime (Periods 8-12 demands: 64,52,43,38,27). Lead time observations (Period1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8) consistently show 4 periods. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the newest lower-demand regime; mu_hat will be computed as (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands, and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 5 demands. This lowers target base-stock and reduces holding cost risk given high on-hand inventory (67) and sizable in-transit (158), while preserving service under confirmed lead time=4.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent demand has down-shifted vs. historical (recent periods demand: 52,43,38,27,59; recent mean \u224844). On-hand=77, in-transit=89; lead time previously confirmed as 4. To reduce overstock risk while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using the recent 5-period regime so mu_hat reflects the lower recent mean across the (1+L) review+lead horizon; set sigma_hat from the same recent 5 samples to capture current volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019/5/20 Period 15. Recent demand has fallen vs historical (recent 5-period demands = 43,38,27,59,63; mean \u224846) and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=54 + in-transit=102 provides coverage but demand regime is lower than historical. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms 4; I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new lower-demand regime and reduce overordering, which balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent demand has fallen versus the 2019-Jan historical sample; last 5 observed demands (Periods 11-15) = {38,27,59,63,74} -> recent mean \u2248 52.2. On-hand=11, in-transit=142 so pipeline is ample but demand remains lower; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods so use promised/default L to match backend. To avoid excess holding while preserving service, I set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (captures the downward shift) and sigma_hat on the same recent window to reflect current variability. This reduces target base-stock versus historical average and limits new orders while pipeline arrives.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Historical sample mean (2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04) was ~100 but recent windows show a sustained drop; carry-over already confirmed a demand regime shift and lead time=4. On-hand=0, in-transit=208 (pipeline large). I set L to calculate to let backend use observed lead times (all observed =4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime (focus on most recent 5 demand observations to form (1+L)-period forecast). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than older higher-variance data. This keeps orders aligned to the lower recent demand and limits excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 6 (recent weeks ~50-75). On-hand=0, in-transit=271 \u2014 pipeline appears sufficient to cover (1+L) periods at current lower demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 4). For demand I use recent_N to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime (N=12 covers Periods 6\u201317). Same recent_N=12 for sigma to capture current volatility. These choices bias the base-stock to the lower recent mean and use recent volatility so the OR backend balances service vs holding given the confirmed lead time and sizable pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=14, in-transit=218. Concluded history consistently shows observed lead times = 4 periods (use averaged actual). Recent demand has shifted lower vs. historical; I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the new regime (most recent demands: 63,74,48,34,39). L set to calculated average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 so the OR backend targets inventory for the current lower-demand regime and avoids excess holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=60, in-transit=173. Historical concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has fallen vs earlier history; last 5 observed demands (Periods 15-19) = [74,48,34,39,25], recent mean \u224844. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the 4-period finding but let backend average observed values. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new lower regime ((1+L) horizon) and reduce over-ordering from older higher means. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps pipeline + on-hand ~233 units, roughly matching a 5-period demand forecast (5\xd7~44=220) to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. Current on-hand=134, in-transit=89 (pipeline=223) vs recent demand collapse: last 5 demands (P16-P20) = [48,34,39,25,10], mean\u224831.2. Promised lead time is 4 and recent concluded arrivals confirm 4, so keep L=default. To capture the sustained lower demand regime (5 consecutive low periods) I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock to (1+L)\xd7recent mean and captures recent volatility. This prevents over-ordering given large pipeline and high holding cost (holding=$1 equals profit $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: recent mean (Periods 16-20) = 31.2 vs prior recent mean 71 (Periods 1-5) => decrease \u2248 -56%; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple orders observed arriving after 4 periods).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has fallen materially vs early-sample (recent regime since Period 16: Periods16-20 demand avg \u224831.2, Periods17-21 avg \u224823.4) and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand=188, in-transit=26 \u2192 healthy coverage vs current low demand; no overdue/lost shipments signaled. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 4. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast and volatility to the recent low-demand regime (captures latest 5-period mean/variance and avoids dragging estimates toward much higher historical Jan values). This keeps base-stock and cap responsive to the new lower demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Current on-hand=162 + in-transit=26 provides ample cover vs recent low demand. I use default L (promised/confirmed 4) and set demand estimates using recent data to capture the lower regime: use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures periods 17-22 demand pattern). This keeps orders conservative (lower base_stock) to avoid excess holding cost given Profit=Holding and observed demand decline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=153, in-transit=0; multiple past orders confirmed arriving after 4 periods. I retain promised lead time to match observed confirmation but let backend use its default (promised=4). To avoid overstock given the sustained lower demand, I set mu_hat using a recent_N forecast (last 5 periods) so (1+L)\xd7recent mean captures current low regime. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (last 5) to reflect current lower volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has declined substantially from historical ~100 to a low-regime beginning at Period 16 (Periods 16-24 demand sequence shows lower mean). On-hand=136, in-transit=0; no imminent arrivals. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. To keep orders aligned with the recent low-demand regime while accounting for the 4-period lead time, set L to the observed average (calculate). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (Periods 16-24) to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the confirmed lower-demand regime. This reduces overordering and holding cost while maintaining service for the current lower demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has stayed low vs historical: last 5 demands (Periods 21-25) = [9,26,35,17,41], recent mean \u2248 25.6. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals). To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), I use the promised/confirmed lead time and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5-week regime to reflect the sustained lower demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime vs historical: last 5 demands (Periods 22-26) = [26,35,17,41,58], mean=35.4. On-hand=37, in-transit=33 (some in-transit may be delayed but historical concludes consistently show 4-period arrivals). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (4) which matches confirmed observations; mu_hat uses recent_N N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime over the review+lead horizon (1+L=5); sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This favors lower replenishment to avoid holding cost while keeping service for the observed lower demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has increased over the last 3 periods (Periods 25-27 demands = 41,58,91; recent mean \u224863.3 vs prior regime mean \u224831), so I treat this as a new demand regime and base mu/sigma on the last 3 samples to react quickly. I select L by calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock toward the recent higher demand while keeping volatility estimated from those same samples to balance service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: avg increased from 31.2 (Periods 16-20) to 63.3 (Periods 25-27) (+103%), lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple orders: e.g., P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). Recent demand has increased since Period 25 (periods 25-28 demands = 41,58,91,87) indicating a higher recent mean; lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods. I set L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the post-Period-25 regime (use the last 4 samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This keeps the forecast responsive to the confirmed upswing while the backend caps orders via its policy to limit exposure to lost shipments and holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 25-29) = [41,58,91,87,72], recent mean \u2248 69.8, showing elevated demand vs prior trough. To reflect confirmed LT and recent uptick, set L by calculating observed lead times and set demand forecast and volatility using recent_N (N=5) to capture current regime. This balances service (avoid stockouts given full pipeline) against holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=316 units. Recent demand has jumped: Periods 28-30 demands = 87, 72, 89 (avg=82.7 over last 3), higher than prior regime (Periods 25-27 avg=63.3). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. Given the clear 3-period uptick, I set L by calculation (use observed lead times = 4) and forecast demand using the most recent short regime to capture the new higher mean and volatility. Using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock target on the current high-demand regime, preserving service level while the OR backend caps order size to limit excess holding given equal profit/holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg increased from 63.3 (Periods 25-27) to 82.7 (Periods 28-30) (+31%); Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand regime shows an uptick: Periods 28-30 average = 82.7 (\u2191 vs prior 63.3). On-hand=0, in-transit=352 which covers several future periods but arrivals are observed with 4-period actual lead time (confirmed repeatedly). I set L to default (promised=4, matches observed). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the newest regime (Periods 28-30) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 3). Sigma_hat also recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in the new regime. This prioritizes service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping inventory sizing responsive to recent variability.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=5, in-transit=331 (large pipeline). To match recent regime while keeping the OR engine's review+lead aggregation, I set L to promised (confirmed=4), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current higher mean, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This focuses service on the latest regime while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand has risen sharply over the last five periods (P30-34 demands = 89,101,101,149,131; mean=114.2), and historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (covers multiple lead periods). To capture the recent high-demand regime while respecting confirmed lead time and limiting holding cost, set L to promised (confirmed=4) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases base-stock on the last 5 observed demands (most relevant for current surge). This yields a higher target inventory to avoid stockouts during the ongoing elevated-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: recent mean (Periods 30-34) = 114.2 vs prior regime mean 82.7 (Periods 28-30) \u2192 +38%; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals observed).

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=0, in-transit=473 which already covers multiple (L+1) periods at current demand; to tune service vs holding (profit=holding, q=0.5 \u2192 no safety stock), I set L to promised (default) and forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current high-demand regime. I also estimate volatility from the same recent 5 periods so the OR backend computes base_stock aligned to current demand spikes while respecting the pipeline buffer to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been high and volatile: last 5 realized demands (Periods 32-36) = [101,149,131,115,130], recent mean \u2248125.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=512 (large pipeline that will cover several periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). To capture the current high-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute base-stock and caps, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, use a recent_N=5 for mu_hat to reflect the most recent high-demand regime, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts in high-demand weeks) against holding cost given the large in-transit quantity.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. To cover current elevated demand (recent weeks show substantially higher sales vs earlier regimes), I set L to promised (default) and use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat to focus the estimate on the most recent 7 demand observations (captures the latest high-demand regime). Sigma set to default (uses all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances higher service needs from recent demand while keeping dispersion estimate conservative.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). Recent demand has been in a higher regime over the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 34-38) with average demand \u2248124 units vs prior regime ~114 \u2014 I therefore use the promised/confirmed L=4 and update demand estimates using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current elevated demand and variance. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from recent mean/variance.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Current on-hand=85 and in-transit=456 \u2014 pipeline is ample versus demand. I set L to promised (default=4) because multiple concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated demand regime (use last 5 periods to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility), which balances service level against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand (Periods 36-40 = 130,132,113,80,68) shows a sustained higher regime vs earlier troughs; observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 4 periods. Set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current demand regime (covers review+lead demand using the most recent 5 weeks). This balances service (captures current elevated mean ~104.6) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand has fallen from the prior peak regime (avg \u2248114 units) to lower weekly demand across the last 3\u20136 periods (Periods 36\u201341 demands = 130,132,113,80,68,70; recent mean \u224898.8). Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). On-hand (185) + in-transit (268) = 453 units, which covers ~4.6 weeks at the recent mean but is below the (1+L)-scaled recent demand if using the higher prior peak. To react to the emerging lower regime while remaining conservative given volatility, I set L=default (trust promised/observed 4), mu_hat using recent_N to capture the latest regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (captures recent demand rise/fall) versus holding costs by shrinking the forecast window to the most relevant recent samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: avg decreased from 114.2 (Periods 30-34 regime) to ~72.7 (Periods 39-41) \u2248 -36% (evidence: Periods 39-41 demands 80,68,70); Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=212. There was a single extreme spike at Period 42 (demand=327) but no sustained new regime (one-period event). To respect confirmed lead time I request the backend compute L from observed lead times (method=calculate). For demand I use an EWMA to remain responsive to recent increases without overreacting to a single spike: EWMA_gamma=0.3 (computes (1+L)\xd7EWMA). Volatility is best captured from the most recent short window, so use recent_N with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current variability including the recent spike. These choices keep the base-stock adaptive to recent demand while relying on confirmed lead-time evidence and avoid overcommitting to a one-off surge. On-hand + in-transit (212) will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing pipeline inventory against the (1+L)-period demand forecast.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent demand spiked (Periods 42-43: 327,133) after prior low/mid values; on-hand=0, in-transit=525. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). To react to the recent surge (holiday season / late-Nov spike) while using recent evidence, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend raises target stock and captures heightened variance over the last 5 periods. This balances service (avoid stockouts in the current high-demand window) against holding cost by limiting history to the most recent 5 weeks.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=649. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. Recent demand has been volatile with a single extreme spike at Period 42 (327) but not a sustained new regime (Periods 43-44: 133,54). To keep the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and the long-run sample statistics while avoiding overfitting to the one-off spike, I use default lead time and default demand moments so the backend computes base_stock from the full-sample mean/SD over the review+lead horizon (1+L). This balances service (given large in-transit) against holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 43-46 = 133,54,64,46) indicates a lower post-spike regime; I use a short recent window to capture the current level. Set L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed by concluded arrivals). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (captures the latest 4 realized demands) so the OR backend targets the current lower demand while limiting holding given high in-transit inventory.
