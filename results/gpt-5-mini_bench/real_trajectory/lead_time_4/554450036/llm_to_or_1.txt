Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly sales (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) average ~57.4 units/week (n=5) with no observed changepoint or concluded arrivals; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no overdue shipments detected. No evidence to override promised lead time (4). Use default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline base-stock that covers the review+lead horizon while balancing profit ($19) vs holding ($1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean \u224857.4/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=75 (order placed in P1) and P1 conclude shows arrived=0 (no concluded arrivals yet). No concluded lead-time observations to contradict promised lead time (4), and no sustained demand regime change (only 5 historical samples). Use default promised L and default demand/volatility estimates so backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level given modest holding cost vs. profit margin and accounts for the existing in-transit 75 units.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=155; two prior orders (P1=75, P2=80) have not yet concluded so no confirmed lead-time change. Historical weekly demand samples (71,60,46,48,62) give mean=57.4. Promised lead time is 4 and there is no evidence to alter it. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=4 and rely on historical demand mean/variance. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects historical demand while avoiding overreaction to in-transit but unconfirmed arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=233; no concluded arrivals from prior orders so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Recent observed demand (Periods 1-3) = 75, 60, 72, higher than historical mean (~57). I use promised lead time (default) since no concluded lead-time evidence. For demand I target the recent regime: use recent_N with N=3 to capture the elevated mean; volatility likewise set to recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices raise the backend base stock to protect service given higher recent demand while avoiding assuming an unconfirmed LT change.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent weekly demand samples (71,60,46,48,62) give mean ~57.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=316 (sum of prior orders). No concluded arrivals yet that would allow inferring a lead-time change. I will use the promised lead time and default demand estimators: L=default so backend uses promised L=4; mu_hat=default => (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to forecast 5\xd7mean; sigma_hat=default to capture historical volatility. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock/conservative cap calculations aligned with historical demand while avoiding premature adjustments for potential delivery issues that are not yet confirmed by arrivals.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent weekly demand samples (env): [71,60,46,48,62]; recent realized demands in game: [75,60,72,49,49] \u2014 mean ~57.4/wk. On-hand=26, in-transit=267 (many units en route). Period 5 conclude shows arrival of 75 units (ordered P1) with observed lead_time=4, matching promised lead time. I will use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand/volatility settings so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this preserves the long-run demand estimate and lets the capped order cap constrain ordering given large in-transit pipeline, avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service given confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: arrived=75 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6). On-hand=64, in-transit=231. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed arrivals. Set mu_hat to default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of historical samples (captures baseline demand of the provided 5 weekly samples). Use default sigma_hat to let backend scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This keeps orders aligned with observed 4-period lead time and historical demand while avoiding overreaction to short-term variability or potential lost shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders placed P1-P3 arrived with W=4). On-hand=99, in-transit=189 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy but demand has ranged 42\u201375 in recent weeks. I use observed lead-time averaging to reflect confirmed LT=4, and short-window recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (last 5 demand observations) so the OR backend will size the (1+L)-period forecast to recent demand without overreacting to older samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit) vs holding cost by focusing on recent demand volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (P5-P8 arrivals correspond to orders P1-P4). Current on-hand=112, in-transit=118 \u2192 pipeline=230, which already covers several periods of demand given confirmed L=4. Demand history (most recent periods 4-8): 49,49,42,43,70; no sustained regime shift detected. To target service while controlling holding cost I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use recent_N=5 for demand mean/volatility so forecasts reflect the most recent demand level (~50.6/week) over the (1+L)=5-period review+lead horizon.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=94, in-transit=157; pipeline + on-hand sufficient for several periods but we must respect actual lead time evidence. Observed concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders from P1-P5 all arrived with 4 periods). I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Demand shows no sustained regime shift but recent weeks vary (periods 5-9 demands = 49,42,43,70,44); to better capture the latest level I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock reflects current demand variability over the review+lead horizon. This balances service (use recent demand) vs holding cost (avoid over-reacting to older high samples).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in carry-over). On-hand=93, in-transit=154 provides ample pipeline but demand history (samples: 71,60,46,48,62) indicates a steady mean ~57.4. Profit/holding (19/1) imply service-focused stocking; using default calculations lets the OR backend compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and default volatility; this balances higher service level given high profit and confirmed reliable 4-period lead time. No evidence of a new demand regime or lost shipments.

Current on-hand 89 + in-transit 194 = 283 units in pipeline, which is near the (1+L)*mean \u2248287 demand over the review+lead window; no strong recent demand regime change detected. Use default lead time and demand estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding overfilling given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=46, in-transit=218. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P8 all arrived with W=4), so use the observed lead time. Demand history (weeks in Jan provided plus full game history) shows no recent, sustained demand regime shift. Profit/holding ($19/$1) implies a high target service level, so keep demand estimates based on full-sample stats to let the OR backend compute the high base-stock. Chosen parameters: L use calculated average of observed lead times (confirms 4); mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples), which balances high service requirement vs holding cost given current pipeline and on-hand coverage.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=47, in-transit=207. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; no evidence of recent loss or lead-time change. Demand history (Periods 1-13) shows stable weekly demand ~40-75 without a sustained regime shift. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (4). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to set base-stock and cap, balancing service level and holding cost given stable demand and ample pipeline inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand spiked (Period 14 demand=107, previous weeks 64,55,70 etc.) On-hand=0, in-transit=232 (covers ~46 units/week over the 5-period review+lead window), which is below last week's demand \u2014 we should rely on standard forecast while acknowledging recent uptick. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior history so use default promised L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history) to keep parameters stable given limited sample set and avoid overreacting to a single high week; this balances service vs. holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=241. Concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders from P1\u2013P11 arrived after 4 periods). Recent demand has spiked (last five concluded demands = 55,64,107,139,76? \u2014 note sold pattern shows large increases for P13\u2013P15 with shortages in P14\u2013P15), so I place more weight on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the higher mean and volatility. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the backend target a higher base-stock that covers the (1+L) review+lead window while avoiding excessive holding given low holding cost (H=$1 vs profit $19). This increases service-level during the recent high-demand regime while keeping cap constraints enforced by the OR engine.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-06-03. Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (confirmed previously). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=354 (covers multiple future periods). Demand has risen recently (periods 12-16 = 55,64,107,139,88) \u2014 clear upward shift; I use recent_N=5 to capture the new regime. Set L to promised/default (4) since arrivals have reliably matched promised lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 demands and sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility; this raises target base-stock to meet higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and demand samples (Jan-Feb) have mean 57.4 units/week. On-hand=8 + in-transit=447 provides ample coverage vs. (1+L)*mean = 5*57.4=287 units; no sustained demand regime change detected. Use promised/confirmed lead time and population-based demand estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding unnecessary manual inflation of safety stock given large pipeline. Methods: L default (promised/confirmed 4); mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = 287); sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent concluded history shows stable actual lead time = 4 (consistent arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier) and demand ranging roughly 40\u2013139 with recent weeks 40,34,40. On-hand=34, in-transit=381 \u2014 ample pipeline to cover multiple weeks. I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because concluded arrivals confirm it. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given large pipeline and no new sustained demand regime change.

Demand history shows variability but no new sustained regime shift requiring ad-hoc forecasting. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time average (4). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the full sample set \u2014 this balances service level and holding cost given stable confirmed lead time and no clear recent regime change.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods (consistent arrivals from Periods 5\u201320). On-hand=142, in-transit=178; pipeline + on-hand (320) comfortably covers near-term demand given historical weekly samples. No clear demand regime shift in recent weeks (weekly demand samples from history show variability but no sustained jump over 3+ periods). I therefore use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(samples) \xb1 volatility. This balances service level (profit/hc ratio high: q = 19/(19+1)=0.95) against holding cost; defaults will yield a relatively high target but the existing on-hand + in-transit already provides coverage, so default statistics avoid overfitting to short noise.

Recent orders (Periods 22-23) show no conclude yet but that is consistent with 4-period lead. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead-time and stable historical demand (weekly samples from Feb-Apr show similar scale), set L by calculating observed lead times; use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so backend computes base stock and cap using full sample statistics. This balances service (profit/higher fill rate) against low holding cost ($1/unit) by letting backend choose safety stock based on profit ratio.

Concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4 periods. Use calculated L to reflect observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine sets base-stock from full-sample statistics, balancing high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) while relying on confirmed lead time.

Recent demand has increased (recent weekly demands: Periods 23-27 = 73,49,51,91,106) \u2014 use a short recent window to capture this uptick. Set L to promised (4).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in Period 6 conclude) and demand has been variable but without a sustained structural shift beyond normal fluctuations. On-hand=0, in-transit=306 which should cover multiple future periods given observed demand spikes. I therefore use default settings: trust promised lead time (4) and use full-sample statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base stock and caps from all historical demand data. This balances service level against holding cost without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has stepped up: last 5 period demands = [51,91,106,101,56], mean=81. On-hand=0, in-transit=367 which roughly equals one review+lead demand but is slightly below the 5-period expected demand based on recent mean. Carry-over evidence confirms actual lead time = promised 4 periods (observed earlier). I set L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher-demand regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples so the OR engine orders to cover the elevated demand. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias replenishment toward covering the current high-demand regime while allowing the capped ordering rule to limit excess holding costs.

Pipeline is large (442) so use baseline policy tied to promised lead time. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (4). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level with holding cost given confirmed LT and large inbound pipeline. No evidence of a new sustained demand or lead-time shift.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=10, in-transit=345. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed). Recent demand shows a sustained summer uptick (Periods 26-31: 91,106,101,56,104,87 \u2014 recent mean ~90.8) versus earlier baseline ~57. I set L to default (use promised/confirmed 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the recent high-demand regime (covers Periods 26-31). This increases the (1+L)-period demand forecast to match current demand levels, raising service while accepting modest holding cost; sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility to set safety stock consistent with higher demand variability.

Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use 'default' so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available demand samples, ensuring the base-stock policy balances the high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) while leveraging full historical data.

On-hand 10 + in-transit 351 provides healthy pipeline but some recent orders showed zero arrivals when expected (possible timing noise), so keep lead-time estimate anchored to observed data. Use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample demand stats scaled by (1+L). This balances service (profit>>holding cost) while avoiding aggressive explicit increases that could inflate holding cost given already large in-transit inventory.

Recent demand has been high and more variable (many weeks with demand 40\u2013140 since May); to reflect the recent regime I use recent_N over the recent window to set demand mean and volatility while using inferred lead time from observations. L set to calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 4). mu_hat and sigma_hat set to recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variance, which helps the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances the high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by sizing safety stock to recent variability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=385. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (confirmed P5 message and many subsequent arrivals at LT=4). Demand history shows stable weekly variability around provided samples and recent weeks with high demand but no sustained regime shift. To align backend forecast with observed reality, set L to be inferred from observed lead times and use default demand sizing/volatility so the OR engine applies its historical-sample-based base stock. This ensures pipeline covers (1+L) periods and balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=22, in-transit=323. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. Demand has moved higher in recent months (late summer\u2192fall); to capture the recent regime I use a recent-window forecast. Set L to calculated (reflect observed lead times). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=8) to base (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the most recent 8 concluded weekly demands so the OR engine raises the base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while limiting excess stock via updated volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed in multiple conclude messages). Current position: on-hand=78, in-transit=338 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand has shown variability and occasional spikes. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and let the OR engine compute demand and volatility from full history so the backend's base-stock and cap calculations reflect long-run mean/variance while honoring the confirmed L=4. This balances service (high profit per unit) against modest holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=72, in-transit=283. Carry-over shows actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed earlier). Recent demand samples (historical weekly samples provided) show mean \u224857.4/week; no clear recent sustained regime change (no 3+ period shift). Pipeline (283) + on-hand (72)=355 covers multiple weeks of demand; avoid excess holding. Use default lead time (promised 4) consistent with observed confirmations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (profit/holding gives q) without overreacting to short-term noise or transient late arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=87, in-transit=281. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (carry-over insight already recorded). Profit/holding \u2192 high service quantile (q=19/(19+1)=0.95). Use promised/confirmed lead time and aggregate historical demand to let OR compute base-stock and cap. Choices: L=default to use promised 4; mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples; sigma_hat=default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances high service level driven by profit vs holding cost while leveraging full demand history and confirmed lead time.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent history shows mostly 4-period actual lead times; we currently have on-hand=0 and in-transit=298. No sustained new demand regime (the large 268 demand in Period 42 is a single spike), and no evidence of lost shipments beyond previous confirmations. Use promised/confirmed lead time to size the (1+L)-period forecast. Choosing default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history so the capped policy balances service level (through base-stock quantile) against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in Period 6 conclude) and no new sustained changepoints in demand. Current on-hand=57 plus in-transit=307 provides substantial pipeline coverage. I will use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical-sample mean and variance scaled by (1+L). This keeps the policy stable given no new regime shift and balances service level vs holding cost with the backend's risk-cap adjustments.

Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=7, in-transit=423. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (confirmed earlier). Pipeline + on-hand is large (430) so I will use the standard/default forecasting anchored to historical samples and promised lead time to let the OR engine compute base stock and cap using the full sample mean/variance.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=8, in-transit=412. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (already recorded). To keep OR backend aligned with promised lead time and recent demand, I use L=default (promised=4). Recent demand in Dec shows elevated and variable weekly sales (including a large spike at Period 42), so I set mu_hat using recent_N to emphasize the most recent 8 weeks to capture holiday-season demand dynamics. I keep sigma_hat as default to let backend compute volatility from full history; this balances higher service level from a recent mean while avoiding overfitting variance from a single spike.

Current on-hand=22, in-transit=505 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals are only visible with one-period delay. Demand history (provided samples and full period history) shows no recent sustained regime shift. I therefore use default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand/statistics so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute base_stock and cap. This keeps service high given large pipeline while letting the backend balance profit vs holding cost using full-sample estimates.
