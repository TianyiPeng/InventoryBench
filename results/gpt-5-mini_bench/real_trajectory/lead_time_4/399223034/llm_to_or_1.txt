Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU is women\u2019s jeggings; historical weekly demand samples = [28,20,21,11,11], mean \u2248 18.2, no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals so no evidence of lead-time change or demand regime shift. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to set base-stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent sample mean \u224818.2/week (historic samples: 28,20,21,11,11) and Period 1 demand=12. On-hand=0, in-transit=31 (order placed Period 1) but arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude \u2014 cannot infer lead-time change yet (no concluded arrivals beyond promised). Use promised lead time and population-based estimates so OR backend applies base-stock consistently: L default to promised 4; mu_hat default to (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to capture typical demand over review+lead; sigma_hat default to sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples to reflect historical volatility. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded periods show orders placed in P1 and P2 have not arrived (arrived=0), indicating delays but insufficient periods to confirm a new lead-time. On-hand=0 + in-transit=60; historical sample mean=18.2/week -> (1+L)\xd7mean with promised L=4 yields target coverage \u224891 units, so pipeline is currently short. I keep L=default (promised 4) because actual lead time is not yet confirmed; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance and will increase ordering to rebuild coverage while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=88 which equals sum of prior orders (no arrivals have concluded yet). Promised lead time is 4; concluded history provides no arrivals to infer a shorter/longer actual lead time, and missing arrivals are not yet past promised LT. Demand history (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) shows mean demand ~18.2/week; no sustained regime shift detected. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand/statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current uncertainty and potential delayed shipments.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=89 (orders P1-4 total 89). No concluded arrivals yet\u2014this is consistent with promised L=4 (orders placed in P1\u2013P4 would first appear in conclude messages starting P6 if lead time=4). Demand history (weekly samples) mean=18.2. Given no confirmed lead-time change or demand regime shift, use default settings so backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps the policy aligned with promised lead time while the pipeline resolves; it avoids overreacting to delays that are not yet confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-21.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent observed arrivals show an actual lead time of 4 (Period 5 conclude: ordered on P1 arrived in P5 -> lead_time=4). Current on-hand=29, in-transit=58 (total pipeline 87). Recent selling has fallen vs. historical samples (last 5 periods demand = 12,10,6,5,2; mean=7.0). To avoid overstock given falling demand, set L by calculation from observed lead times; set demand forecast using the most recent 5 periods (captures the current lower-demand regime); set sigma from the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base stock vs. long-run averages and help limit holding cost while maintaining service for the shorter recent demand level.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period5 conclude, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Historical weekly demand samples: [28,20,21,11,11] (mean=18.2). On-hand=55, in-transit=29 \u2192 pipeline total=84 units. Promised lead time=4; concluded history confirms lead_time=4 (Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6). Expected (1+L)*mean demand = 5*18.2 = 91 units over review+lead window, so current pipeline (84) is slightly below that target. I choose L=default (use promised/confirmed 4), mu_hat=default to anchor to long-run sample mean across the (1+L) window, and sigma_hat=default to reflect historical volatility. These settings prompt the OR backend to raise target stock to cover the 5-period demand while balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-48.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 (three observed arrivals with W=4). On-hand=76, in-transit=1 => healthy stock but low pipeline. Recent demand (Periods1-7) is lower than older Jan samples, indicating a downward demand regime; I use the recent 7 periods to capture current demand level and volatility. Set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4; use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the current low-demand regime, reducing excess ordering while maintaining service given low pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has downshifted vs. historical Jan samples: last 5 observed demands (Periods 4-8) = [5,2,3,7,2], avg \u2248 3.8. On-hand=75, in-transit=0 and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in concluded history). To avoid overstock while maintaining service, set L by calculation (uses observed lead times=4). Forecast demand using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower regime for mu_hat and reduce volatility for sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5). This keeps base-stock small (matches current low demand) and prevents excessive holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=73, in-transit=0; recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 5-9 = 2,3,7,2,2) is substantially lower than the older sample set, so I use a recent-window forecast to avoid over-ordering given holding cost. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times (confirmed 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the low recent demand regime and lower volatility, keeping inventory lean while meeting service goals.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=69, in-transit=0; recent concluded history confirms orders placed earlier arrived with lead_time=4 and no arrivals pending now\u2014no overdue arrivals visible. Demand recent (Periods 5-10) is low (2\u20134/week) vs historical samples (Jan values higher). Profit=4, holding=1 implies service quantile q=4/(4+1)=0.8. I choose to infer L from observed lead times (calculate) since multiple conclude messages confirm L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, avoiding overreaction to short low-demand run while respecting confirmed lead time and current high on-hand stock. This balances maintaining service (via confirmed L) without increasing orders given ample on-hand inventory, reducing holding cost risk.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized well below the historical samples: periods 5\u201311 demands = [2,3,7,2,2,4,5], avg=3.57 over 7 periods. On-hand=64, in-transit=0 and no arrivals expected soon. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods (observed consistently), so use observed-average lead time. For demand forecast I use the recent 7-period regime (N=7) because the drop is large and sustained vs historical mean (18.2 \u2192 3.57, -80%). This keeps mu_hat tied to current low sales to avoid excess holding cost. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7) to reflect current low-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: avg historical samples (2019-01) = 18.2; recent avg (Periods 5\u201311) = 3.57 (\u221280%), sustained for 7 periods

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history (orders P1\u2013P4 all showed LT=4). Historical Jan samples mean=18.2 but a sustained demand regime shift was observed starting Period 5: average demand in Periods 5\u201311 = 3.57 (7 periods). To reflect the sustained lower demand, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times) and use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes demand across review+lead using the most recent low-demand regime. This lowers base-stock and reduces holding costs while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13): on-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical data and carry-over show lead time confirmed=4 and a sustained demand drop starting Period 5 (recent low-demand regime persists through Period 13). No shipments currently overdue. Set L to calculated average (reflects confirmed LT=4). Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 5\u201313) so the OR backend targets service with lower mean and volatility, reducing overstock and holding cost.

Historical Jan samples mean=18.2 but demand dropped sharply starting Period 5 and has stayed low (Periods 5\u201314 mean \u22483.7). Lead-time observations from concluded messages are consistently 4. I set L by calculate to reflect observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 5\u201314) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime for (1+L) review+lead forecasting. I use recent_N N=10 for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices reduce forecasted order quantities to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for the new low-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand drop (Periods 5\u201311). To respect confirmed lead time and recent low-demand regime, set L explicitly to 4. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the 7-period low-demand regime, avoiding overweighting the earlier higher-demand January samples. This keeps target base-stock small to limit holding cost while preserving service for current low demand.

Lead time previously confirmed as 4. To avoid overstocking given sustained low demand, use recent regime for demand estimates. Set L to default (promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (captures the sustained low-demand regime of 7 periods). This reduces target base_stock and caps orders to balance service vs holding cost given high holding relative to profit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=5 (Period17 order). Actual lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods and matches promised L=4. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period5 (sustained drop) but Period17 showed a one-off large stockout-driven spike (demand=98, sold=32). Because the lower-demand regime is sustained, I use recent_N across the current regime to capture recent mean while allowing the OR engine to compute safety stock. I set L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select recent_N with N=13 (Periods 5\u201317 length of the recent regime) so the backend uses the (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std of the most recent 13 samples, which balances lower recent demand evidence while letting the optimizer set safety stock to mitigate occasional spikes given profit/holding tradeoff. This also accounts for the in-transit 5 units (will arrive in 4 periods) and avoids over-ordering into an evidently lower-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=60 (orders from P17=5 and P18=55). Historical sample set shows a long low-demand regime after Period 5 but very large recent spikes at P17\u2013P18. Promised lead time = 4 and earlier concluded evidence confirmed LT=4; use default promised L. To capture the recent demand surge (last 5 demands = 0,7,13,98,73 -> mean=38.2) I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the backend computes (1+L)*recent_mean and responds quickly to the spike. Volatility also set to recent_N N=5 to reflect increased variance from the recent large demands. These choices aim to raise target base stock to avoid stockouts during the current surge while letting the backend cap control order size to limit overstock/holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=172. Historical concluded lead times confirm 4-period actual lead time earlier; many recent orders still in-transit. Demand history shows a long low-demand regime (Periods 5\u201311) but very large observed demand in Periods 17\u201319 (likely partially censored by stockouts). To balance service vs holding cost I keep L at promised (4) and use an EWMA forecast to responsively weight recent high demand without overreacting: mu_hat via EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.3). Use default sigma_hat (all-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to avoid underestimating uncertainty given mixed regime and censoring. This setup protects against stockouts from recent spikes while limiting excess inventory holding.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1. On-hand=0, in-transit=262 (orders from Periods 17\u201320). Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods and promised L=4 remains appropriate. Recent demand has become highly volatile (large spikes in Periods 17\u201320) so I use recent_N=7 to let the backend capture the current elevated mean and volatility over the most recent 7 periods (covers the recent spike regime including Periods 14\u201320). This balances service (avoid stockouts while the pipeline arrives) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the most recent regime rather than older low-demand history.

Demand has shown a sustained low regime earlier (Periods 5\u201311) but recent periods (12\u201321) include several large realized demands after stockouts; to balance service vs holding cost I use an L inferred from observed lead times and recent demand statistics over the last 10 periods to capture the post-stockout demand pattern while limiting excess safety stock given holding cost > profit ratio. This keeps orders responsive to recent volatility and the confirmed lead time.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 Period23. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; on-hand=32, in-transit=202. Demand shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period17 (six consecutive high-demand periods: 98,73,41,34,27,23). To reflect the new regime, set L to default (use promised 4). For demand forecast use recent_N over the new high-demand regime so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean/volatility (N=6). This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts given large pipeline and high recent demand while upstream lead time remains promised 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg increased to 49.33 (Periods 17\u201322) from prior recent avg 4.75 (Periods 5\u201316), sustained for 6 periods

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent regime: sustained high demand since Period 17 (Periods 17\u201323 avg \u224849.33). On-hand=72, in-transit=159 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals will only be visible after conclude. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods; no new lead-time evidence. I choose L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 17\u201323) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For volatility I use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent variance. These settings bias the base-stock toward the elevated demand while keeping holding cost in mind given already-large on-hand+pipleline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 17 (weekly demands: P17..P24 = 98,73,41,34,27,23,72,42) \u2014 sustained high demand. On-hand=120, in-transit=155 (orders from P23:69 and P24:86) so pipeline + on-hand =275 units. Use promised lead time (default) since concluded history consistently shows 4-period arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 17\u201324). This biases base_stock upward to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; using recent samples prevents dilution by the low-demand early-period regime and balances service level vs. holding cost given profit $4 and holding $1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg increased to 49.33 (Periods 17\u201324) from prior avg 4.75 (Periods 5\u201316); sustained for 8 periods

Demand regime: sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 17 (Periods 17\u201324 avg \u224849.33, length=8). Pipeline + on-hand are substantial but demand now clearly in the higher regime; use recent regime data to size target stock. Set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (the sustained high-demand regime length) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the high regime, improving service while limiting excess holding given current inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent sustained high-demand regime since Period 17: last 10 demands = [98,73,41,34,27,23,72,42,55,97], mean=56.2/day. On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Confirmed actual lead time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals). With promised L=4, (1+L)=5 so pipeline target \u22485\xd756.2=281 units; current pipeline (in-transit 201) is short \u224880 units. I set L=calculate to lock inferred lead time=4 from observed concludes. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=10 to capture the new high-demand regime and its volatility; this drives the OR base-stock toward higher inventory to avoid stockouts while capping orders via the backend cap to limit overstock given holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 17 (Periods 17\u201327 avg \u224849.3) and lead time confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=234 (covers multiple upcoming weeks). I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) since confirmed; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime to capture the new mean/volatility. I choose N=11 (Periods 17\u201327) because the elevated-demand regime is sustained for 11 periods; using recent_N focuses the (1+L)-period forecast on current demand and avoids dilution by older low-demand data. This raises target base stock to meet service during the high-demand regime while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=265. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time =4 (multiple arrivals showing lead_time=4). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 17 (sustained high demand, avg \u224849.33 over Periods 17\u201324 and continuing through Period 28). I set L using calculated/observed lead time (calculate) to reflect confirmed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N to capture the new high-demand regime; I choose N=12 (using the most recent 12 demand samples from the sustained high-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=12 so sigma_hat captures current variability. These parameters prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap rule; using recent samples avoids averaging down with older low-demand data.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 17 (avg \u224849.3 over Periods 17\u201324 and continued through Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=354 (covers multiple upcoming periods given L=4). Promised lead time=4 and concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4, so use default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N equal to the current regime length (Periods 17\u201329 = 13 periods) to capture the elevated mean/volatility while limiting dilution from older low-demand periods. This keeps base_stock responsive to the high-demand regime and lets the capped order cap restrain single-period overordering given pipeline stock, balancing service level (avoid stockouts during high demand) against holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=397 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (Periods with arrivals match ordered\u2192arrived gap=4). Demand shifted up at Period 17 and has stayed high (Periods 17\u201330 demands = [98,73,41,34,27,23,72,42,55,97,123,103,110,126], 14 periods). To capture the recent high-demand regime, set lead time to promised default (4) and use recent_N=14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the sustained recent regime. This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost given large in-transit stock; the backend cap will still limit order quantity if pipeline already sufficient.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent sustained high-demand regime began at Period 17 (avg \u224849.33 initially, now higher); observed lead time consistently 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=333 which is below (1+L)*recent_mean demand for the current high-demand regime, so we must forecast using the recent high-demand regime. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period actuality. Use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full post-changepoint regime (Periods 17\u201331, N=15) so the OR backend targets service during the sustained high-demand period while avoiding reliance on older low-demand data.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning at Period 17 (Periods 17\u201332 = 16 weeks) with large, persistent weekly demand; lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from concluded arrivals. Current inventory: on-hand=17, in-transit=338 (sizable pipeline). I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history (confirmed = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=16 to base the (1+L)-period forecast on the entire sustained high-demand regime since Period 17 (regime_length=16 \u2192 N=16). I apply recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N=16 so volatility reflects the current high-demand regime. These choices focus the base-stock on the new higher-demand regime while accounting for the confirmed lead time and large pipeline to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent history shows the high-demand regime that began at Period 17 has persisted through Period 33 (sustained large weekly sales). On-hand=36, in-transit=323 (pipeline ample versus current high demand). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages; keep promised lead time. To capture the sustained post-Period-17 regime I select recent_N for demand estimates using the full current regime length (Periods 17\u201333 = 17 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher mean and volatility. This keeps the backend base-stock responsive to elevated demand while pipeline stock mitigates short-term stockouts.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 17 (Periods 17\u201334: avg \u2248 80.8 units/week, 18 samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=374 which is slightly below a 5-period (1+L) coverage of the recent regime (\u2248404). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=4 consistently. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 (the full length of the confirmed high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current high-demand mean and volatility over the 5-period review+lead window. This configuration helps the optimizer raise target base_stock to meet high sustained demand while keeping variability estimated from the same regime to avoid understocking; it also accounts for the outstanding in-transit units being slightly short of the (1+L)-period forecast so the backend can order to top up.

Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (regime from P17\u2013P35, N = min(regime_length,20)=19) so mu_hat captures the elevated recent mean across the (1+L) review+lead window. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the backend target stock aligned to the current high-demand regime while recognizing strong pipeline to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 17 (Periods 17\u201336 = 20 periods of elevated demand vs prior low regime). Current inventory: on-hand=66, in-transit=347 (pipeline total=413) which covers multiple weeks of elevated demand but some in-transit arrivals may still be needed given promised lead time. I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded messages consistently confirm 4-period arrivals and no new evidence of lead-time drift. For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (regime_length=20, so N=20). I apply recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets a base stock appropriate to the new higher mean and its volatility, balancing service level (avoid stockouts during high demand) against holding cost given the large pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing noise, I use recent_N=20 for demand estimates (covers the most recent 20 periods within the high-demand regime). This keeps target stock aligned to elevated demand and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent sustained high-demand regime began at Period 17 (avg ~49.33 through Period 24 and continued high volumes through Period 38). On-hand=161, in-transit=244 => pipeline=405 (ample coverage). Promised lead time is 4 and prior concludes consistently show LT=4; use default L. To capture the elevated demand regime, use recent_N based forecasts using the most recent regime: choose N=20 (regime length >20, cap at 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)-period mean/volatility from the last 20 samples. This keeps service levels aligned with the higher demand while backend cap prevents excessive single-period orders given current large pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 17 (Periods 17\u201339 high demand, ~49 avg) so I base demand estimates on the recent high-demand regime. On-hand=215 and in-transit=191 (total pipeline=406) \u2014 ample cover vs. near-term demand but must replenish for continued high regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; use promised/default. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent sustained high-demand regime (use max cap 20), which raises the base-stock to meet higher expected demand while sigma from the same recent window preserves safety stock for variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts in high regime) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Promised and observed lead time = 4 (confirmed historically). Use L default to keep backend lead time aligned with promise. Demand forecast should reflect the recent high-demand regime (Periods 17+); use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained elevated mean/volatility while limiting older low-demand influence. sigma_hat uses the same recent_N window to reflect current volatility. These settings bias orders toward service (capture higher mean) while the backend cap prevents excessive single-period receipts to control holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 17 (avg \u224849.33) that has persisted through Period 41. On-hand=207, in-transit=185 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. To capture the sustained high-demand regime while avoiding overweighting old low-demand weeks, I set L to default (use promised 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the post-changepoint regime (cap N at 20 per rules) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 demand samples; likewise sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to the confirmed higher demand while the OR backend cap will limit oversized orders given current pipeline and holding cost tradeoff.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 17 (avg ~49.33/week) lasting many periods; single extreme spike in Period 42 (d=338) appears episodic but downstream demand remains elevated. On-hand=0, in-transit=186 \u2014 pipeline is material but not visible until conclude; keep promised lead time. I set L to default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (regime length >>20); this biases base stock toward the higher recent mean while smoothing short extreme spikes. For volatility I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent variability. These choices help the OR backend raise service-level for the sustained higher demand while limiting overreaction to single-week outliers, balancing profit ($4) vs holding ($1).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=342 (covers multiple future periods). I retain promised lead time (default) = 4. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use most recent 20 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure base_stock and cap reflect the elevated recent demand while leveraging the large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering and limit holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=502. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4. Demand regime shifted up at Period 17 and has persisted; recent periods show high weekly demand. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime I set L to the promised/default (4) and use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the last ~20 periods of the high-demand regime. This keeps the (1+L) forecast responsive to the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. With profit=4 and holding=1 the backend will target a high service level; using recent data avoids underforecasting while the large in-transit (502) will reduce immediate ordering pressure.
