Rationale for overriding OR: OR recommended 105 (uses long-run history and promised L) but recent regime shows demand \u2248+~166% vs earlier averages and lead time is confirmed at 4, so we must replenish heavily to avoid large stockouts over the 4-period lead time; the cost of stockouts (lost profit) on this high demand outweighs additional holding cost given confirmed surge. Risk note: holding cost = profit, so excess inventory is costly if surge reverses; however the surge has been sustained 5+ periods and is large, so ordering to cover the next (L+1) periods is justified. Therefore place order = 937 units.",

Recent demand has been elevated since Period 31 with large spikes (Period 42 had a 690 spike and Weeks 43\u201345 =156,249,257), but carry-over insights already record those sustained shifts. Holding cost equals profit, so overstock is costly; we should not aggressively top up beyond OR's capped suggestion because we already have a large in-transit shipment (379) arriving this period that will replenish on-hand before most upcoming demand. Therefore follow OR recommendation of 235 to modestly top up pipeline for periods after the arriving 379, avoiding excessive holding given demand uncertainty and equal holding/profit tradeoff.",
