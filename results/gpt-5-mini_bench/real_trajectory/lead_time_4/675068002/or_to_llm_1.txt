  "rationale": "Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals P1\u2192P5 ... P42\u2192P46). Recent realized demand has fallen from the mid-hundreds earlier to ~60\u201375 units in the last 4 periods (P43\u2013P46: 60, 73, 59, 52; recent average \u224861). With L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 upcoming periods; expected 5-period demand \u22485\xd761\u2248305. Current pipeline inventory (on-hand 217 + in-transit 342 = 559) comfortably exceeds this (~559 > 305), so no replenishment is needed now. Ordering would only increase holding cost (holding cost = profit = $1/unit/period) without improving sales given adequate pipeline. Therefore follow OR's recommendation and order 0 units.",
