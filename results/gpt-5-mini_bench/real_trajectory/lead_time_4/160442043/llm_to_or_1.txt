Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 160442043 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5 points, Jan\u2013Feb) will be used as the baseline. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1) and no evidence of regime change or delayed shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=45 (order placed Period 1 still in-flight; promised LT=4 so no concluded arrivals yet). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean \u224835.6. No sustained changepoint or lead-time evidence (only one order placed and no arrivals yet). Use default promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given no confirmed shifts and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demands: historical weekly samples mean=35.6; two most recent conclude records show large demand realizations (44 and 114) but no arrivals have concluded yet (orders placed in P1/P2 not arrived). No sustained lead-time evidence (need \u22653 periods) and possible lost/delayed shipments cannot be confirmed. Use promised lead time (default) so backend uses L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts draw on all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to balance service level vs holding cost given high uncertainty and current in-transit=92 units.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent concluded history shows no arrivals yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=189 (sum of prior orders 45+47+97). Promised lead time is 4 and we have no concluded arrivals to infer a shorter/longer actual lead time, so use the promised/default lead time. Historical weekly samples (Jan 2019) show steady demand (~mean 36); with no clear changepoint, use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base stock from the full-sample statistics and known promised lead time while respecting the cap on order size and existing pipeline.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded periods show no arrivals yet but that is expected given promised lead time=4 and arrival visibility lag; not enough evidence to confirm lost shipments or lead-time change. Historical weekly demand samples (29,32,42,38,37) give mean \u224835.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=257 which exceeds (1+L)*mean (5*35.6\u2248178), so no extra risk of stockout. Choose default lead time and demand stats so OR backend uses full historical sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L), balancing service level (meets expected 5-week demand) vs. holding cost (pipeline already high).

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand baseline from historical samples ~35.6/wk; no on-hand inventory and 212 units in-transit. Period 1 order arrival recorded (arrived in Period 5), which matches the promised 4-period lead time. Given no sustained demand regime change and lead time matching promise, use defaults so backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps target base stock aligned with historical demand while relying on in-transit stock to cover upcoming demand during the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, observed lead_time = 4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, In-transit=209. Two concluded arrivals show lead_time=4 (Period1->P5, Period2->P6) so I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times. No sustained demand regime shift detected in historical weekly samples (29,32,42,38,37), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base-stock while the pipeline (209 units) is expected to cover several upcoming weeks.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=19, in-transit=165. Historical base-samples mean=35.6 (Jan data) but recent demand shows a sustained uplift (periods 4\u20137). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded arrivals, so set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (last 4 periods) so the OR engine stocks for the elevated demand while keeping volatility based on recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 4\u20137: historical avg 35.6 -> recent avg 60.8 (+71%), sustained for 4 periods

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=10, in-transit=180. Historical sample mean=35.6 but a sustained demand regime shift was observed in Periods 4\u20137 (recent higher demand). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior conclude messages. To reflect the sustained higher demand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=4) so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility; L uses the promised/confirmed lead time (default). This keeps supply aligned to the new higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples and accounts for in-transit inventory and possible lost shipments by relying on recent evidence.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=270. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead time=4 (orders from P1-P4 arrived with lead_time=4) and a sustained demand uptick since Period 4 (recent weeks much higher than historical). Use calculate for L to lock in observed lead time=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime (last 5 demand observations: P5\u2013P9 = 50,65,78,77,77). This biases base-stock and cap upward to reduce stockouts given in-transit pipeline and confirmed higher demand, while sigma based on recent volatility prevents excessive overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand elevated: last 7 period demands (P4\u2013P10) average \u224867.9/week vs historical lower mean\u2014sustained high demand since Period 4. In-transit=303 and on-hand=0; with L\u22484, review+lead horizon =5 periods, pipeline (~303) roughly matches 5\xd7recent mean (~339) but still exposed to variability and possible missed arrivals (Period 9 had zero arrival). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (confirmed \u22484). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained higher regime; sigma_hat also recent_N,N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base stock to cover the new higher demand regime while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift to higher weekly demand (Periods 4\u20137 and recent weeks). To align orders with observed lead time and recent demand, set L using observed lead times and set demand forecasts using the most recent regime (last 4 demand periods) so the backend sizes base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while keeping variance estimated from the same recent window. This leverages confirmed lead-time evidence and recent demand regime to avoid understocking despite prior lost/late arrivals.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Historical baseline mean ~35.6 (samples Jan\u2013Feb) but a sustained demand uplift was observed in Periods 4\u20137 (recent avg ~60.8, +71%) and persists through recent concludes. On-hand=25 + in-transit=289 already cover multiple weeks of elevated demand, but pipeline contains arrivals from prior orders with confirmed 4-period lead time. Set L via calculate to use observed lead-time history (confirmed =4). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the elevated recent regime (regime length=4 \u2192 N=4) so the backend computes base-stock over the review+lead period using the recent higher mean and volatility, balancing service level versus holding cost given large existing pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=77, in-transit=233. Historical data and conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 and a past demand regime shift to higher demand; recent demand has softened but remains above original baseline. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 concluded demand observations) to capture the most recent demand level while reacting to the earlier spike. Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep the base-stock responsive to current demand without overreacting to older high outliers, balancing service level and holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand showed a sustained upward regime around Periods 4\u20137 (carry-over), and recent periods (P9\u2013P14) remain elevated vs early-sample mean, so use recent sample window to capture current demand level and volatility. Set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent 7 demand observations, balancing service level against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=219. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand has been elevated and variable. I choose L by calculating observed lead times to lock onto the confirmed 4. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (Periods 11\u201315 demands = 65,58,38,82,127 => recent mean \u224874, higher than earlier history) so the OR backend will size base-stock for the current higher-demand regime while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals) against holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=264. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods consistently (observed many P -> P+4). A demand regime shift was previously detected (Periods 4\u20137 avg rose from 35.6 to 60.8). To respect confirmed lead time I set L by calculating observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 demand samples) and reduce dilution from older low-demand samples. Volatility is set to recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent variability. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to the sustained higher demand while the calculated L ensures pipeline coverage for the confirmed 4-period lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=386. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; recent demand has risen (Periods 15\u201317 demands = 127,114,97). I set L by observed history to let backend use actual lead time. Demand forecast uses the most recent regime (last 5 periods: Periods 13\u201317) to capture the upward shift; mu_hat uses recent_N so (1+L)\xd7mean of those 5 samples. Sigma also uses recent_N over the same 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. With L=4 and recent-demand weighting, the base-stock will raise replenishment to cover higher sustained demand while avoiding excessive holding since holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 15\u201317: recent avg increased from 60.8 to 112.7 (+85%), sustained for 3 periods; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple orders observed Pn->Pn+4).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in prior concludes). Recent demand regime increased sharply and was sustained in Periods 15\u201317 (recent avg \u2248112.7 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=452 which is likely insufficient for (1+L)=5 periods at the recent higher demand level, so we must size forecasts to the new high-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 15\u201317) so the OR engine targets service for the new mean/volatility and helps avoid stockouts while accepting higher holding given profit=holding.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=438 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple Pn->Pn+4). Recent demand regime (Periods 15\u201317 and onward) is elevated; use the most recent short-run sample to capture current demand spike while letting the OR cap limit large single orders given high in-transit. Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to target the (1+L)-period demand under the new high-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level needed for the demand jump against holding cost and large existing pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand remains at the elevated regime (~110\u2013125 units/week over Periods 18\u201320). On-hand=22 + in-transit=419 \u2192 pipeline ample vs expected demand; multiple past concludes confirm actual lead time=4. I set L=calculate to lock in observed 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent stable high-demand samples (Periods 18\u201320) so the base-stock reflects the confirmed higher regime. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to capture current volatility over the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service during the sustained higher-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline limits immediate additional ordering risk.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime from Periods 15\u201317 (avg 112.7, +85% vs prior regime) and lead time consistently observed = 4 periods (multiple Pn->Pn+4 arrivals). Current inventory: on-hand=87, in-transit=389 (total pipeline=476) which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods at the recent demand level. Choices: set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4 from concluded arrivals; set mu_hat to recent_N with N=3 to target the (1+L)\xd7mean using the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 15\u201317); set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to capture volatility of the same recent regime. This keeps the backend\u2019s base-stock responsive to the confirmed higher demand while using observed lead time to avoid underordering despite past delayed/lost shipment risk.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=54, in-transit=373. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 20\u201324 = 108,91,86,128,82) remains elevated vs earlier history; I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current high-demand regime and a matching volatility estimate. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed=4). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 5 weeks' mean/variance so the OR backend orders to cover (1+L) periods of the current demand level while avoiding overstating older low-demand samples.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since mid-May (Periods 15\u201325 average \u2248100 units/week vs earlier ~60). On-hand=102 and in-transit=315 (total pipeline 417) \u2014 ample coverage for multiple weeks but demand remains elevated. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; use calculated lead time. Forecast demand using recent data to reflect the higher regime: use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 19\u201325) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock respond to the current higher mean and volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been elevated vs early history with volatility; last 8 demand samples (Periods 19\u201326) average \u224892.5 units/week. On-hand=122 + in-transit=333 => pipeline=455 units, which covers multiple weeks of current demand but some arrivals may still be en route. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm that evidence to the OR engine. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=8) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 19\u201326) rather than the full historical mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias ordering toward the recent higher-demand regime while the large current pipeline plus on-hand inventory tempers new orders to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and recent demand regime elevated (Periods 15\u201317 avg ~112.7). Current on-hand=110, in-transit=277 (healthy pipeline). Set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time (4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 (use last 3-period elevated regime) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat use recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. This focuses service on the new higher-demand regime while avoiding overstating uncertainty given abundant pipeline, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent on-hand=162, in-transit=157. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods \u2014 use calculated average to reflect observed reality. Recent demand (Periods 24\u201328 = 82,78,43,76,68) appears lower than the earlier high regime; to adapt to the most recent pattern I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) so the OR engine builds target inventory for the current lower-demand regime while still using observed lead time. This balances service (cover near-term demand) vs holding cost by reducing forecasted (1+L)-period demand and volatility to recent levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 15\u201317 avg \u2248112.7, recorded previously). On-hand (166) + in-transit (117) = 283 units, which is below (1+L)*recent demand if L=4 and recent mean ~112.7 (5\xd7112.7\u2248563), so we must size forecasts to the recent high regime. Use L=default (promised=4, confirmed historically) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent confirmed demand regime (last 3 periods, N=3) to capture the higher mean/volatility while keeping responsiveness to any reversal.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has moderated from the mid-summer spikes; last 10 observed weekly demands (P21\u2013P30) average ~79.4 units. On-hand=169, in-transit=100 gives substantial cover vs expected demand. Lead time repeatedly observed as 4 in concluded history. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm the persistent 4-period lead. For mu_hat I use a recent_N forecast (last 10 weeks) to capture the more recent, lower post-spike demand (1+L multiplied by mean of last 10 samples). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (last 10 samples) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk from older high-demand regime while maintaining service through the known 4-period lead time.

Recent demand over the last 8 weeks (Periods 25\u201332) averages ~67/week; using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat captures current regime while smoothing older high-volatility spikes.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded Pn->Pn+4) and a sustained high-demand regime since Periods 15\u201317 (recent avg ~112.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=259 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals are only visible after arrival conclude. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time average (uses concluded lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to target the most recent high-demand regime (regime length=3 \u2192 N=3). Volatility is likely tied to that same recent regime, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variance. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the confirmed higher demand while using recent variance for safety, and avoid diluting the forecast with much older, lower-demand samples.

Recent demand has varied (peaks earlier in summer; recent weeks P31\u2013P34: 67,62,76,64). With confirmed LT=4 and available pipeline (307) covering future demand, use default lead time and default demand/statistics to let the OR engine compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This avoids overreacting to short recent swings while respecting the confirmed lead time and current large in-transit position.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime first detected Periods 15\u201317 (avg \u2248112.7 over those 3 periods). Current inventory: on-hand=72, in-transit=242 (pipeline=314). Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded evidence confirms L=4. To reflect the elevated demand regime and avoid stockouts while the OR backend uses promised L=4, I select L=default and set demand estimate using the most recent confirmed regime (3 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the higher mean and volatility (N=3). This balances service (reduce stockouts given pipeline) versus holding cost by not inflating forecasts with older low-demand samples.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand (Periods 34\u201337) = [64, 51, 46, 58], recent mean \u224854.75. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand=40, in-transit=216 \u2192 pipeline total=256 which slightly undercovers (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 recent mean \u2248273.8. To respond to the most recent regime and avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost, I use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility (captures last 4 weeks). I keep L at default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history confirms it. These choices bias ordering slightly up relative to long-run average to cover the recent higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute service-level-corrected base stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=102, in-transit=122. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4; I keep L=default to match promised/confirmed lead time. Recent demand has fallen from prior high regimes; last 4 observed demands (Periods 35-38 = 51,46,58,50) average ~51.25. To avoid overstock given high holding cost (=$1/unit/period) I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7current low-regime mean and captures short-term volatility. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) while limiting holding cost given substantial on-hand+pipeline inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=137, in-transit=90. Carry-over confirms sustained lead_time=4 and past demand regime shifts, but no new 3+ period signal since last insight. To be conservative and let the OR engine use full historical statistics (avoiding overfitting to recent noise), use default lead time and default demand uncertainty: L=promised (4), mu_hat and sigma_hat computed by backend from all samples. This keeps replenishment aligned with confirmed lead time and historical demand variability while balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=148, in-transit=168. No new sustained demand or lead-time changepoint since previously recorded shifts; use promised lead time and historical sample stats so backend computes base-stock and cap consistently. Default mu/sigma let OR engine apply full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (given sizable pipeline) versus holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has trended down over the last 5 weeks (periods 37\u201341: 58,50,30,28,22) after earlier high-demand regimes; on-hand (126) + in-transit (203) = 329 units. Promised lead time has been repeatedly confirmed at 4 periods in concluded messages; I keep L at the promised value to match observed delivery cadence. To react to the recent downward demand trend I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) so the base-stock reflects the recent lower mean and reduced volatility, limiting excess holding given holding cost equals profit. This balances service level vs holding cost by tightening forecast around the latest regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Multiple concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand (Periods 38\u201342) has moderated vs. earlier spikes; last 5 demands = [50,30,28,22,45], mean=35. With promised L=4, use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to reflect current lower regime and avoid excess holding given high on-hand (99) + in-transit (185). sigma_hat also set to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent variability. This yields mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean to balance service vs. holding costs under confirmed L=4.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent realized demand has dropped sharply over the last 5 periods (P39\u2013P43 avg \u224830.8) after earlier high-demand regimes; pipeline healthy (on-hand=103, in-transit=152). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I set L to 'calculate' to lock confirmed LT=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (use last 5 samples), reducing order targets to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service. This balances profit vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/unit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 39\u201343: recent avg decreased from 112.7 to 30.8 (\u221272.7%), sustained for 5 periods; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple Pn->Pn+4 observations).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand has been in the low-volume regime since Periods 39\u201343 (carry-over noted: avg fell to ~30.8). On-hand=202, in-transit=35 \u2014 ample coverage versus current low demand; few overdue/missing shipments. Promised lead time is 4 and recent concludes consistently confirm L=4, so use default promised lead time to keep OR engine aligned. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new low-demand regime (uses last 5 samples to compute (1+L)*mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) so variability reflects the low-demand recent regime. These choices reduce excess holding by lowering target base-stock to the recent low-demand mean while keeping lead-time at the confirmed 4 periods so pipeline coverage matches reality.
