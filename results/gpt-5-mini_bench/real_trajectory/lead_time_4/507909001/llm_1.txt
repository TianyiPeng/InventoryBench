With lead time L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 future periods of demand because current period demand occurs after decision. e) Final order logic: forecast ~145 units/week \xd7 5 periods = 725 units.

Even using a conservative elevated weekly forecast (e.g., 200/wk) target coverage = 5*200=1000 units; shortfall=275 but any new order placed now would arrive after four periods (too late to affect early unmet demand) and risks excess holding cost since profit and holding cost are both $1/unit/period.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas), no major upward seasonal driver expected for this womens shirt SKU. Demand regime: recent confirmed regimes show large swings; most relevant sustained regime is Periods 36-40 avg=118 units/period. Last five periods (42-46) average \u224897 units/period, a modest decline but not a clear sustained regime shift. Lead time: historically confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods; in-transit 90 units (order from P46) expected to arrive per that cadence. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=366 + in-transit=90 = 456 units available (in-transit arrives after decisions). Target coverage = (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using a conservative demand forecast \u2248110 units/period \u2192 5-period demand \u2248550 units. Shortfall = 550 - 456 = 94 units. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit, so avoid large overstock. Final order: round up to 100 units to cover expected demand while keeping inventory risk moderate.",
