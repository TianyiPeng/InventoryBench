Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit stock and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u2248144.6 units. Promised lead time is 4 periods and there is no evidence to change it. To let the OR engine compute base-stock using full-sample stats, I select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend uses promised L=4 and (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service level using historical mean while avoiding overfitting given no new regime or lead-time evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent historical weekly demand samples (80,144,194,176,129) give mean=144.6 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=218 (Period1 order) and no arrivals concluded yet (promised L=4). No observed lead-time concludes to revise L. Use promised lead time (default) so backend uses (1+L)*mean across all samples for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)*std for sigma_hat, preserving the historical demand baseline while accounting for the 5-period review+lead window and avoiding premature adjustments given limited data and no confirmed late/lost shipments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent observed weekly demands (historical samples through 2019-02-04) average ~144.6 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=477 equals ordered(218+259) \u2014 shipments are pending but not yet concluded, so no confirmed lead-time change or lost orders. I will use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this is conservative given no concluded arrivals and avoids overreacting to two periods of unmet demand that reflect in-transit stock.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=883 which equals sum of orders from Periods 1-3 (218+259+406) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals contradict this yet, so use default lead time. Historical sample mean \u2248144.6/week; with L=default (promised=4) I keep default demand & volatility estimation ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine uses the full review+lead demand forecast while avoiding premature adjustments for missing concludes.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=1087. No concluded arrivals in Periods 1-4 so we cannot infer actual lead time yet (promised L=4 remains best). Use default lead time (promised L=4). Demand history (5 weekly samples: 80,144,194,176,129) shows no clear regime shift; use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect the 5-period review+lead demand and default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) for volatility. These conservative defaults keep the OR engine's base-stock anchored to historical average while the large in-transit volume provides buffer against short-term shortages and avoids over-reacting to unconfirmed delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows a Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 with lead_time=4, confirming actual lead time equals the promised 4. Current on-hand=28 and in-transit=869 (total pipeline 897). I choose L by 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time evidence. Demand history shows no sustained new regime (only a single recent drop), so use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (use confirmed lead time) against holding cost conservatively given large pipeline inventory and limited evidence of a persistent demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period 1 order arrived Period 5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (Period 1\u21925, Period 2\u21926). Current on-hand=114, in-transit=785 (ample pipeline). Demand history samples average 144.6/wk; with promised lead time 4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods. I choose default lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples (captures long-run average demand) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for variability. This is conservative given strong pipeline and confirmed LT=4, avoiding overreaction to short-term noise while letting the backend compute the base-stock that balances $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent on-hand=265, in-transit=533. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior conclude messages so use promised/default L. Recent demand has shifted higher versus the older Jan samples; I use the last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 3-7: 312,214,190,173,255) to capture current regime. With L=4 (review+lead =5 weeks) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant data, balancing service (cover higher recent demand) against holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Historical weekly demand samples (seed): [80,144,194,176,129], mean=144.6. Observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (seen in Period 5/6/7/8 concludes). Current inventory: on-hand=115, in-transit=650 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=765 units, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 weeks of expected demand. I use default lead time (promised 4, confirmed by arrivals) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples. This leans on full-sample estimates (stable historical mean) to keep service high while avoiding aggressive up-weighting that would raise holding costs given already-large pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand (Periods 5\u20139 = 190,173,255,354,147) is materially higher than the older samples from Jan; on-hand=0, in-transit=1010. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived after 4). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in that confirmed LT. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new, higher demand regime (last 5 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sizes base-stock and cap to meet elevated short-term demand while reflecting recent volatility. This balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by focusing safety stock on the recent higher-demand regime and relying on confirmed LT to avoid under-ordering.

Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=14, in-transit=943. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 (confirmed in Period 6 and subsequent concludes). Demand samples (provided) reflect baseline weekly demand; no sustained recent regime shift detected. Use promised/confirmed lead time and population-wide demand stats so the OR engine computes base stock and caps with full-sample mean/variance. This keeps service given large pipeline while avoiding manual over-adjustment for non-sustained fluctuations.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=187, in-transit=737. Historical arrived messages consistently show 4-period actual lead time; demand samples available are limited and no strong recent regime shift is evident. Use calculated L to lock in observed lead time; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (high pipeline) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand = 435, in-transit = 506 (pipeline sizable). Use promised/confirmed lead time and full-sample demand stats: historical samples (80,144,194,176,129) give mean ~144.6; with (1+L)=5 this implies baseline demand coverage ~723 units. Choosing default methods keeps OR backend's standard base-stock calculation aligned with observed steady demand and confirmed lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has settled lower than early spikes (last 5 concluded demands: P10-P14 = 218,140,148,112,86; recent mean \u2248 141). On-hand (458) + in-transit (481) = 939 units, which comfortably covers a 5-period exposure at the recent mean (~705). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages, so use lead-time estimate from observations. Use a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the downshift in demand and reduce excess safety stock; match sigma to the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices keep service high while limiting holding cost given current ample pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P11\u2192P15). On-hand=514, in-transit=328 \u2014 ample coverage versus historical weekly demand (historic sample mean 144.6/week). Profit=Holding so service vs. cost tradeoff is balanced. Use promised/default lead time (4) and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). This avoids overfitting to short-term swings while the delivery pattern remains stable. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments required.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent demand has softened vs earlier peaks; last 5 period demands = [148,112,86,97,64], mean \u2248101.4. On-hand=565, in-transit=340 \u2192 pipeline=905, which covers ~5 periods at recent demand (5\xd7101.4\u2248507) so inventory is ample. Lead time has been consistently observed at 4; use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower recent regime and avoid over-ordering from older high-demand weeks. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This reduces target base-stock and cap, lowering holding cost while maintaining service against current demand.

Historical weekly samples (seed): mean=144.6, no recent sustained demand regime change visible; concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and stable demand, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Recent demand has shifted vs early-sample (recent 5 demands = [86,97,64,189,176], mean=122.4) so I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=5 to capture the current regime. sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters aim to stock (1+L) periods of recent demand while keeping safety buffer tuned to recent std to balance $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent realized demand has risen sharply (Periods 17-19: 189,176,277) versus earlier historical mean (~144.6). On-hand=136, in-transit=349 \u2014 ample pipeline but recent 3-period demand spike is sustained. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods; use promised/default L to keep OR engine aligned. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (Periods 17-19) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (capture higher recent demand) while the large in-transit stock limits immediate stockout risk; keeping L=default avoids over-correcting for lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17: avg demand historical = 144.6 (samples 2019-01), recent Periods17-19 avg = 214 (189,176,277) \u2192 +48%, sustained 3 periods

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 17 (periods 17-20 demands: 189,176,277,205; recent avg \u2248 211 vs historical ~145). On-hand=58, in-transit=527 (pipeline large). Promised lead time = 4 and concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4, so use default L to match promised lead time. To capture the higher recent demand I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 (focus on periods 17-20) so the (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the new regime. Volatility also appears higher in the recent regime (notable spike at 277), so set sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect recent variance. This steers the OR engine to raise base stock for higher service under the new demand regime while the in-transit stock and cap will limit over-ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=813 (large pipeline). Historical samples (2019-01) mean=144.6 but a sustained demand regime shift began Period 17 (periods 17-21 demands = 189,176,277,205,200; recent avg \u2248 209). Promised lead time=4 and concluded history repeatedly confirms 4-period actual lead time. To reflect the higher recent demand regime I set L to default (promised=4) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the last 5 demand samples (Periods 17\u201321).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=44, in-transit=825 (large pipeline). Promised lead time = 4 and prior conclues consistently confirm 4. To capture the post-change demand level while respecting the long pipeline, set L to default (use promised 4). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to base the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast on the 3 most recent post-changepoint samples, and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect increased volatility in the same recent window. This raises target base-stock to meet higher demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=928 which is large relative to (1+L) demand; promised lead time remains consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. I use L=default (promised=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the higher post-changepoint mean and variance ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples) so the OR base-stock targets the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N N=7 captures the recent volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts in the new higher-demand regime) against holding cost given the already-large pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Current on-hand=188, in-transit=645. Historical sample mean=144.6 (2019-01 data) and prior carry-over notes indicate a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 17 (avg ~214) but no new 3+ period signal since Period 20. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To be conservative and compatible with the OR engine (which expects promised L), I use default lead time (promised L=4). I also use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full samples; this avoids overfitting to short recent fluctuations while letting the engine's capped order policy limit orders given current pipeline. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given high pipeline inventory and past confirmed lead time.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history confirms actual lead time = promised 4 periods repeatedly. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 17 (sustained); recent elevated demand persists. On-hand=382, in-transit=455 (ample pipeline). I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (evidence strong and stable). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 17\u201325 capture the new regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 9 samples) \u2014 this focuses the base-stock on the higher recent demand. For volatility I use recent_N N=9 to reflect recent variability. These choices raise target base-stock to meet sustained higher demand while sigma based on the same window controls safety stock; with current healthy on-hand + pipeline this avoids unnecessary extra ordering while preserving service.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=472, in-transit=239. Historical concludes consistently confirm lead time=4. Demand regime shift detected starting Period 17 (Periods17-19 avg \u2248214, +~48% vs earlier mean) and persisted through recent data; recent 10 periods (P17\u2013P26) cover the elevated regime and capture current variability. To bias the OR backend toward the higher, sustained demand while still using the promised lead time, I set L=default (promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 10 demand observations\u2014this raises the base-stock to match the sustained higher demand while reflecting recent volatility and avoiding overreacting to single outliers. This balances service level (profit and units sold) against holding cost given current large on-hand and in-transit positions.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (Periods 17-19 avg=214 vs historical 144.6; regime persisted through latest periods). Current inventory: on-hand=363, in-transit=267 (pipeline total=630) which covers several weeks at elevated demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; use promised/default L=4. To capture the shifted demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the current regime length (Periods 17\u201327 => 11 periods). This biases the base-stock toward higher recent mean while sigma reflects recent volatility, helping the OR backend balance service level (avoid stockouts from higher demand) against holding cost given on-hand coverage.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals at 4). Demand samples (2019-01) mean = 144.6; use full-sample defaults to let backend compute (1+L)*mean and volatility with L=promised 4. Current on-hand=153 + in-transit=477 provides healthy coverage; using default L/mu/sigma keeps OR engine aligned with observed lead time and historical demand while avoiding overfitting to volatile recent spikes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=670. History shows consistent observed lead_time=4 (many concluded arrivals at W=4) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (higher mean demand since P17). I set L by averaging observed lead times to confirm actual lead_time=4. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Period 17 onward) to capture the sustained higher demand; regime length = 13 periods (P17\u2013P29) so N=13. sigma_hat uses recent_N with same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend size base_stock to meet the higher recent demand while acknowledging the confirmed 4-period lead time and current in-transit pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=899. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and no recent lost-shipment pattern. Demand regime increased starting Period 17 (Periods 17-19 avg = 214 vs historical Jan avg ~144.6; sustained). I therefore keep L = promised (default = 4) and set demand estimates using the recent high-demand regime. I select recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N = 14 (Periods 17\u201330 inclusive) because the elevated regime spans 14 periods; N is >=3 and <=20 per rules. This raises the (1+L) demand mean and volatility to better cover the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit pipeline (899) tempers immediate ordering risk.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=843. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. Demand regime increased starting Period 17 (sustained), so use recent regime data for demand estimates. Set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the current high-demand regime (use last 15 periods since the changepoint at P17 and regime length=15) so the OR engine targets stock for the higher demand and accurately scales safety stock given current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but variable arrivals) against holding cost.

Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 in concluded history\u2014use promised lead time.

Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods multiple times; use promised/default lead time. For demand, use a recent_N estimator to capture the sustained higher-regime (regime length Period17\u2192Period33 = 17). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=17 so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the latest 17 samples; this balances higher target base-stock to avoid stockouts against holding cost, while the large in-transit (772) will be offset by the backend pipeline calculation.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=901. Historical carry-over shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (avg increased ~+48%); lead time has been consistently observed as 4. I keep L as default (promised=4). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 17\u201335, regime_length=19) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the last 19 demand samples. This balances higher target service level given elevated demand while letting the OR cap limit extreme orders.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 17 (confirmed earlier). On-hand=49, in-transit=906 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=4 and concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. To capture the post-Period-17 demand regime while using recent evidence, set L to default (use promised lead time=4). For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent detected regime (regime length = 20 periods \u2192 N=20) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean; use sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (by sizing to recent higher demand) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=165, in-transit=736 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand has been elevated since Period 17 with many recent high weeks (Periods 30\u201333: 344,329,339,378) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. Promised lead time = 4 and multiple concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4. To reflect the recent higher demand while giving OR engine recent demand signal, set L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to weight the last 20 demand samples (captures the sustained higher regime), and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to balance service (profit=holding so q=0.5) while capping orders per the backend cap to limit overstock given already large in-transit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Historical sample mean = 144.6 (2019-01 samples) and previous carry-over confirmed a demand regime shift starting Period 17; lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4. On-hand = 397, in-transit = 548 (healthy pipeline). No new sustained changepoint detected in recent concluded periods. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=406, in-transit=471. Recent history already recorded a demand regime shift starting Period 17; no new sustained changepoint detected in the last periods. To keep the OR backend aligned with long-run stats and the confirmed lead time, use default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using confirmed L=4) against holding cost without overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Historical data and conclude history confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple observed arrivals). A demand regime shift was detected starting Period 17 (sustained higher demand since then), so I rely on recent post-changepoint samples to forecast. Current on-hand=491 and in-transit=384 (total pipeline 875) which comfortably covers several weeks of demand; using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the sustained higher-demand regime while allowing the OR engine to compute safety stock given promised L=4. This balances service (avoid stockouts in higher regime) against holding cost by not using the long-run low-demand mean.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime uplift beginning Period 17 (+~48%). On-hand=490, in-transit=368 (total pipeline+on-hand=858) \u2014 ample coverage but demand has been elevated since Period 17 so use recent data to reflect new regime. Set L conservative to promised/default (4). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise; this balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Historical Jan 2019 samples mean=144.6 used as baseline; multiple concluded messages confirm actual lead time=4 in history and recent shipments have been arriving on-time. Current on-hand=490 + in-transit=300 = 790 units, which exceeds the (1+L)\xd7mean demand forecast (~723) so pipeline coverage is adequate. I choose L=default (use promised lead time=4) and default demand/volatility calculations to let the OR backend compute base_stock from all historical samples; this is conservative given no new sustained changepoint and avoids overreacting to short-term noise or past temporary spikes. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments is needed (no recent prolonged missing arrivals).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; on-hand=476 + in-transit=420 provides large coverage. A demand regime shift beginning Period 17 (sustained higher mean) is in the history, so I bias forecasts to the recent regime. Set L to promised/default (4). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift demand statistics (N chosen = min(regime_length,20) to cover the sustained higher-demand regime) so the OR backend raises base-stock to protect service while remaining capped to limit excess ordering and holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=467 + in-transit=349 => pipeline=816 units. Promised lead time = 4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show L=4. No clear, new sustained demand regime change in recent weeks (last 3 demands: 105,150,50,103 are mixed). I therefore use the defaults so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, relying on the confirmed promised lead time. This keeps the base-stock calibrated to long-run demand while avoiding overfitting to noisy week-to-week holiday volatility and protects against misinterpreting short shipment timing noise.

No new sustained demand or lead-time shifts detected since prior confirmed signals (lead time confirmed 4; demand regime shift at Period 17 already recorded).

With profit=holding, critical fractile q=0.5 so z*\u22480; using conservative baseline (no recent regime change since last recorded shift in Period 20) I use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates derived from all samples: mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to center base stock on long-run average, sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect observed volatility. This keeps orders moderate given already-large on-hand + pipeline (total 847 units) and avoids overreacting to short-term noise or possible lost shipments.
