Decision: do not order now (order=0). Rationale summary: existing in-transit shipment already exceeds long-run 5-period demand and will arrive soon; given symmetric profit/holding costs and uncertainty about whether the recent spike persists, avoid preemptive ordering that may incur holding costs.

OR raw order = \u03bc\u0302 \u2212 pipeline = 723 \u2212 603 = 120. However OR recommendation shown (335) appears inconsistent with its own formula; regardless, we must weigh recent realized demand and holding cost. Recent weekly demand has declined (Periods 11\u201316: 140,148,112,86,97,64; last 3 avg \u224882), suggesting demand is below historical mean. With profit = holding cost, overstocking is costly; we prefer to avoid adding inventory unless pipeline clearly insufficient. Pipeline (603) is only 120 units short of the 5-period expected demand per historical mean, but recent actual demand is materially lower, and we already hold substantial on-hand (353) that will service immediate demand. Given uncertainty and symmetric cost structure (profit = holding), I reduce risk of excess holding by not ordering this period. Action: order 0 units. This preserves cash and avoids extra holding cost while pipeline can cover near-term demand; monitor upcoming concludes for arrivals and demand to revisit orders.",
