Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly samples (5 weeks) available; no evidence of regime shift or seasonality yet. Use promised lead time and population statistics: set L to default (promised 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent realized demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean = 151.2 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=210 (order placed Period 1 not yet concluded); no concluded arrivals so actual lead time unknown. Promised lead time=4 chosen (no evidence to override). Use default demand estimates so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std based on all samples; this yields provision for 5 periods of demand (covers current period demand after decision plus lead). This balances service level (covering expected demand across lead+review) against holding cost given low holding cost ($1 vs profit $19). No explicit adjustments for lost/delayed shipments because no concluded misses yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (orders from Periods 1-2). Promised lead time is 4. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 have not yet arrived (arrived=0), but that is only 2 missed arrivals\u2014insufficient to confirm a lead-time shift per rules. Demand history samples (Jan 2019 weekly: 158,154,201,140,103) show no clear recent regime change. To avoid overreacting to potentially delayed shipments, keep L at the promised default so the OR engine assumes the communicated lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using full-sample demand forecast) against holding cost while we await more conclusive arrival evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=664. No concluded arrivals yet for prior orders; promised lead time (4) not disproven. Use default lead time and demand estimates from all historical samples (stable pre-season weekly demand: mean ~151 units). This ensures the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full history, while the large existing pipeline (664) will be considered by the engine when capping orders to avoid overstock.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): on-hand=0, in-transit=780. Historical weekly demand mean=151.2 (samples 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04). Orders from Periods 1-4 have all shown arrived=0 (4 consecutive periods), indicating sustained delays or lost shipments vs promised LT=4. To be conservative, set lead time explicitly longer so pipeline coverage and OR backend stocking target rise; keep demand forecast based on full-sample mean scaled by (1+L) and default volatility to let backend compute safety stock. This increases orders now to cover expected coverage while accounting for delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: No arrivals observed for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (arrived=0 each); indicates sustained shipment delays or losses vs promised LT=4 \u2014 treat effective lead time as longer until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Daily Profit: $551.00, Daily Holding Cost: $181.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $370.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history shows Period 5 arrived=210 (ordered P1) with observed lead_time=4, confirming promised LT=4. Current on-hand 181 + in-transit 781 implies substantial pipeline but some prior delays resolved by P5 arrival. Use L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (confirmed=4). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7historical std (leveraging all samples) to balance service level versus holding cost given confirmed LT and sizable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Historical demand mean = 151.2/wk (samples provided). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5; Period 2 in Period 6). On-hand=397 + in-transit=554 = 951 units in pipeline. With promised/confirmed L=4, review+lead horizon = 5 periods; default forecast (1+L)*mean = 5*151.2 = 756 units demand over horizon, so current pipeline comfortably covers expected demand while avoiding excess holding. Use default demand/volatility calculations to let OR backend compute base-stock and capped order while preserving service vs holding tradeoff.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Use promised/default forecasting to let OR backend compute base_stock from full-sample mean/variance; this balances service level (profit$19 vs hold$1) without overreacting to earlier transient delays.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/08 (Period 9). Recent demand has been moderate with variability (history: 33,21,21,56,29,11,22,71) and historical weekly samples (provided) average ~151.2. On-hand=647, in-transit=211; current inventory is ample vs recent demand so no aggressive ordering needed. Lead time evidence: multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P4 arrived after 4 periods). I therefore set L by 'calculate' to use observed lead times (will equal 4). For demand forecast and volatility I choose 'default' so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which anchors the base-stock policy on the long-run sample mean while the calculated L captures the confirmed lead time; this balances service level (protects against 4-period replenishment) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-58.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P5 arrived with W=4); on-hand=818, in-transit=0, so no immediate arrivals expected. Historical demand samples (weeks in Jan\u2013Feb) average ~151.2/week; with confirmed L=4 I use a conservative default forecast that scales the historical mean across the (1+L) review+lead window. I choose L via "calculate" to lock in the observed lead time rather than relying on promised defaults; mu_hat and sigma_hat use "default" to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set. This keeps orders aligned to long-run demand while the confirmed LT=4 reduces risk of underordering; using full-sample statistics avoids overfitting to short recent volatility given ample on-hand inventory.

Use mu_hat default so backend computes demand over (1+L)=5 periods from all samples (captures baseline weekly mean \xd75). Use sigma_hat default so backend scales historical std by sqrt(1+L). This provides a stable forecast and lets the OR engine apply its high service-level (profit/holding implies high fill-rate) while avoiding manual overreaction to recent inventory abundance.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm (backend will yield 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime and its volatility so the OR engine targets cover for (1+L) review+lead while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=581, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P4 all arrived with lead_time=4); no recent missing-arrival signal beyond that. Demand history (samples provided) shows mean ~151.2/week. I set L by calculating observed lead time average to capture confirmed LT=4. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a stable base-stock that balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) while leveraging the confirmed lead time. This keeps pipeline targets conservative given current high on-hand and zero in-transit.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concludes (Periods 5-9) consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4; demand history (seed samples) mean ~151.2/wk. Current on-hand=504, in-transit=14 (no arrivals visible yet for recent orders). Given confirmed LT=4, use calculated average lead time to match actual behavior. Use default demand scaling (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to provide stable forecast across review+lead period and default volatility to let OR backend size safety stock from historical variance. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by relying on historical mean and confirmed LT so orders aren't inflated by short-term spikes while maintaining service over the 5-period horizon.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived with LT=4) and no sustained demand regime shift beyond the seeding samples. Current on-hand=283 and in-transit=85 (pipeline=368) \u2014 inventory is ample versus typical weekly demand from the seed samples. I therefore use default lead time (promised LT=4) and default demand estimators that use all provided samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the OR backend anchored to the long-run sample statistics and lets its capped ordering rule limit replenishment given current high inventory, balancing service level (profit-driven q) against holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=130, in-transit=255 (pipeline=385) \u2014 inventory ample vs recent demand. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods (observed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). Demand has moved to a higher regime since early Apr (Periods 9\u201316: demands = [40,55,76,106,77,98,123,153], avg \u2248 96). I select L=default (use promised LT=4) because concluded arrivals consistently show LT=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the new higher-demand regime (N=8 equals the last 8 concluded demand periods 9\u201316). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility so the OR backend raises base stock to protect service while we avoid overreacting to older low-demand samples. No evidence of new lost shipments.

Historical samples (seed) mean=151.2/week; recent observed weekly demand has been higher but arrivals in concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 4. To respect promised LT and confirmed evidence, set L to default (use promised=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this yields a conservative replenishment that balances service (avoid stockouts given confirmed LT=4) against holding cost given already-large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=72, in-transit=495. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders placed P1..P5 arrived with W=4), so use calculated lead time. Demand has increased in recent weeks (higher weekly sales from ~55 up to 153 then stabilized ~90\u2013123); to capture the recent regime I use a recent_N forecast for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with N=8 (balances recency vs sample size). These choices produce (1+L)-horizon demand reflecting the higher recent mean and variance so the OR engine raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts while capping orders per its cap to limit overbuying given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Recent demand (Periods 10-19) is materially higher than the Jan samples and shows increased mean and variability; using recent window to capture current regime. I set L via "calculate" to use observed lead times (avg=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent 10 demand observations so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet higher recent demand while capping orders to control holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 when shipments arrive; use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Demand samples (historic weekly series) have mean ~151.2; using default methods (which apply (1+L) scaling) provides a baseline forecast and volatility for the OR engine.

Pipeline + on-hand currently ample vs recent weekly demands, but prior delays/losses were transient and subsequently resolved. I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (evidence: many concluded orders with lead_time=4). For demand forecast and volatility I select default methods so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this leverages full historical sample set given no recent sustained demand regime shift.

Recent conclude history shows consistent arrivals with observed lead_time=4 when shipments conclude; no sustained new lead-time shift beyond confirmed 4. Pipeline plus on-hand comfortably covers several weeks of demand but recent weeks show high variability and elevated demand versus the small seed samples, so keep demand estimate based on full-sample default to smooth noise. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (observed = 4 periods), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding overreaction to short-term swings or transient missing arrivals.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (orders placed arrive after 4 periods). Current on-hand=283, in-transit=247 (total pipeline+on-hand=530) which comfortably covers several weeks of demand. No sustained demand regime change detected vs available historical samples. Therefore keep L inferred from observed lead times (calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set\u2014this balances service level given confirmed LT=4 while avoiding overreacting to recent noise.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). Demand baseline from provided samples: mean \u2248151.2 units/week. Current inventory: on-hand=328, in-transit=205, pipeline_total=533 which is below a full (1+L)-period coverage (5\xd7mean\u2248756), so the OR engine should target replenishment. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will produce 4), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances the profit/holding tradeoff while letting the OR engine apply its capped policy to manage in-transit shortfalls and potential lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=377, in-transit=132. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmations). Recent demand has stabilized around ~41 units/week (Periods 23-27 mean \u224840.8). To target service while avoiding excess holding (profit $19 vs hold $1 \u2192 high service weight), I use promised/confirmed L and base demand on the most recent 5 periods to capture current regime. Chosen N=5 balances recency and sample size; sigma also from recent 5 to reflect current variability. These parameters give the OR backend an up-to-date base stock covering (1+L) periods without overreacting to older data or past transient delays.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=388, in-transit=88 (total pipeline=476) which is healthy vs recent weekly demand pattern. Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 (multiple orders observed arriving after 4 periods), so use calculated lead time. Use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because no recent sustained demand regime shift detected in the available sample set (early 2019 samples mean=151.2). These settings allow the OR backend to set a base-stock that reflects the confirmed L=4 while relying on overall historical mean/variance to balance service level vs holding cost.

Recent demand has moderated but shows no sustained regime shift. To be conservative and consistent with confirmed LT, use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend applies full-sample mean/variance (no unverified changepoint adjustments). This balances high profit/low holding cost (high service target) while avoiding overreaction to short-term demand fluctuation.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Observed lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history (orders placed P1->arrived P5, etc.). Current on-hand=404 and in-transit=106; pipeline + on-hand (~510) comfortably covers multiple weeks of recent demand. Recent realized demand has fallen from the Jan sample means to a much lower steady weekly level (~20\u2013100, recent 5-week avg \u224830.8). To avoid overstock given high on-hand, use promised lead time (default) and compute demand forecast & volatility from the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current low-demand regime. These parameters reduce replenishment size versus using the full-sample mean, lowering holding cost while keeping service for short lead time=4.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed in P1..P27 arrived after 4 periods), so use calculated lead time. Demand history (provided samples) is limited; no strong recent changepoint detected, and on-hand + pipeline is high vs typical weekly demand, so use default demand estimates: let backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from samples. This keeps service high while avoiding unnecessary bespoke volatility adjustments given confirmed LT=4 and ample inventory.

Current on-hand=340, in-transit=118 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy with no newly overdue shipments visible in concluded messages. I therefore use the promised/default lead time so the OR engine uses L=4, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service level (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding unnecessary extra inventory given adequate on-hand+pipleline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=336, in-transit=126. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (confirmed by Period 6 evidence), and recent arrivals show no sustained change. Pipeline + on-hand comfortably cover near-term demand, so keep forecast anchored to historical demand samples. Set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed average lead time (4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding ratio) against holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=337, in-transit=105. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 across many observed orders. Demand in recent periods (last ~20 weeks) has stabilized near the 30\u201350/week range. I set L using calculated historical lead times to reflect observed LT=4. I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend sizes base_stock for the (1+L)-period review+lead horizon and caps orders appropriately given holding cost vs profit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=327, in-transit=78. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 6 concluded P1 arrivals with LT=4), and no recent sustained demand regime shift detected. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised LT and full historical demand, use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level (using full-sample estimates) against holding cost given healthy on-hand plus pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=316, in-transit=125 (total pipeline=441) which provides substantial cover vs. short-run demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple orders confirmed); earlier multi-period silent window resolved. Therefore use calculated lead time from observations (calculate). Demand forecast and uncertainty: rely on default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because no recent sustained demand regime change detected and available historical weekly samples are limited\u2014this balances service level with holding cost given high current on-hand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=334, in-transit=124. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period arrivals (lead_time confirmed=4); no current evidence of loss. Recent demand has stabilized ~30-40 units/week over the last several periods. I choose L=default to use promised (and historically confirmed) 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures recent lower, stable weekly demand and avoids older high-variance samples). This balances service (maintain stock with current demand) versus holding cost by focusing on recent demand patterns.

Demand history (2019 samples) suggests stable weekly demand around historical mean; no clear recent demand regime shift. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual LT=4. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7long-run mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding ratio high) against holding cost while leveraging the confirmed LT and existing pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand history is mixed with one large spike (143 in P42) but generally moderate weekly demand; on-hand=239, in-transit=201 => pipeline+on-hand=440 units. Promised LT=4 has been repeatedly confirmed in concluded messages (observed LT=4), so use default lead time. To avoid overfitting to recent volatile weeks and because on-hand+pipeline already provides several weeks of coverage ((1+L)=5 periods), use default demand and volatility estimates so the OR backend applies the long-run sample mean/std across history. This balances service (keeping coverage for potential spikes) against holding cost given low holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=206, in-transit=201. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed observed arriving after 4 periods). No recent, sustained demand regime shift visible in the history; inventory is healthy. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods (recent confirmations across many orders); no evidence of persistent change. Recent weeks show elevated demand (e.g., Period 42 demand=143, Periods 45-46 demand=64,68) but the supplied historical samples seed the forecast. Current on-hand (138) + in-transit (264) = 402 units, which is below the default coverage for (1+L) periods based on sample mean, so the OR engine should top up. I therefore use the default lead time and default demand/statistics so the backend applies its standard base-stock calculation using all samples; this balances service (using confirmed L=4) vs holding cost conservatively without overfitting short-term spikes.
