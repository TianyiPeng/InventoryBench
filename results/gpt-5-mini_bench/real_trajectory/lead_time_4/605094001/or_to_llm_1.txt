  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed L=4 (carry-over). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=285 (likely 150 from P43 arriving this period and 135 from P46 arriving in 3 periods). Arrival timing implies pipeline already contains the OR-recommended quantity and more. Demand & risk: recent weeks volatile (143 then low then moderate), but no new sustained regime shift since carry-over notes; single large 143 in Period 42 looks like a one-off holiday spike. Policy comparison: OR recommends 135 using promised L and historical demand. Given confirmed L=4 and current pipeline (285) covering multiple weeks of demand (even at elevated ~60\u201390/week), placing additional order today risks high holding cost ($1/unit/period) with limited upside because profit per unit ($19) already secured by pipeline.
