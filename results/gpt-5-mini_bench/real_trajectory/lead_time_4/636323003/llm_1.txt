Forecasting: use recent trend and product seasonality -> conservative forecast \u224860 units/period. Lead time: supplier promised 4 periods; no arrived shipments observed in history, so assume promised LT until we observe concludes. Decision rule: must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (current + next 4) with on-hand + in-transit + orders. On-hand+in-transit=0, so order = 5 * forecast = 5 * 60 = 300 units. Profit per unit ($4) exceeds holding cost ($1/period), so ordering to meet expected demand is justified.

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas/week between Christmas and New Year) typically shows softer apparel demand; product is seasonal womens denim (no strong year-end surge expected). Demand history (recent periods): P42-46 demands = 85,47,29,26,13; last four periods (P43-46) average = (47+29+26+13)/4 = 28.8 units. Confirmed lead time = 4 periods (carry-over). Decision logic: using L=4, cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand as planning horizon. Forecast demand per period conservatively \u224829 (rounded from recent avg) \u2192 5-period demand \u2248145 units. Current available (on-hand + in-transit) = 213 + 24 = 237 units, which comfortably exceeds 145 required. Given positive holding cost ($1/unit/period) and no evidence of an imminent demand surge, avoid ordering to reduce holding costs and risk of excess. Therefore place no order this period.",
