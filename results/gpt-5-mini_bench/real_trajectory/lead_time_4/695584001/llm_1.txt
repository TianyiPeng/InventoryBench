Demand reasoning & forecast: recent 3-week average = 69/week, latest week = 109/week; given the strong upward trend and proximity to Valentine\u2019s Day I bias toward the recent level but remain conservative because holding cost equals profit (overstock is costly). Use a planning horizon of L+1 = 5 periods (promised lead time 4), so we must cover current period demand plus the next 4 unseen periods. Pipeline & lead time: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals exist so cannot confirm actual lead time or lost orders.
