Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (weekly cadence). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean demand \u224878.2 with high variance driven by one large week (198). No sustained changepoint or evidence of lead-time deviation (no arrivals to analyze), so use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats to avoid overfitting to short recent noise. Methods chosen: L=default to keep promised 4-period lead time; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)*mean of all samples and capture overall demand level; sigma_hat=default to reflect observed high variability across all samples. This balances service (covering demand across the review+lead horizon) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=194 (ordered P1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude \u2014 expected since arrivals visible only in later concludes). No concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time or lost shipment; therefore use promised/default lead time. Historical weekly samples (15,50,198,60,68) show mean ~78.2; with no sustained recent regime change, use default demand/volatility computations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost conservatively given current pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=370; two recent orders (P1:194, P2:176) have not concluded yet but promised lead time=4; no concluded arrivals so cannot infer a shorter/longer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u224878.2. Given lack of evidence for a regime shift and promised lead time still plausible, use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance and the promised L. This balances service (use full historical demand to cover L+1 periods) while avoiding unjustified increases to safety stock amid unconfirmed delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed weekly demand has risen: Periods 1-3 demands = 53, 80, 88 (mean \u2248 73.7) versus earlier historical samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (matches orders placed P1-3); no concluded arrivals yet but still within promised lead time so cannot infer lost shipments. Use promised lead time to avoid premature corrections. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the apparent higher recent demand regime (weights the last three observed demands), so the OR engine will raise base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N=3 captures recent volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given zero on-hand and sizable in-transit) against holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=375. Promised lead time=4; concluded messages show no arrivals but actual arrivals (if on-time) would appear in future conclude messages, so do not infer a lead-time change. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-4) = [53,80,88,75] \u2014 use these most recent 4 observations to capture the current demand regime. Set L to default (promised) so OR backend uses promised lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect the latest demand pattern and volatility, providing a forecast across the (1+L) review+lead horizon while avoiding over-reliance on older Jan samples. This balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-60.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). On-hand=127, in-transit=181. Period 5 conclude shows arrival of 194 units (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 5) confirming actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand recent weeks: 53,80,88,75,67 and historical samples provided average ~78.2. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1/$1) -> target service quantile ~0.5, so using defaults lets OR backend set base-stock near demand mean across review+lead period. I therefore use default lead time and default demand statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which is appropriate given confirmed lead time and no sustained demand regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (194 units ordered on Period 1 arrived on Period 5 \u2192 lead_time = 4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Historical weekly demand samples mean=78.2 (samples: 15,50,198,60,68). Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1->P5, Period2->P6). Current inventory: on-hand=252, in-transit=74 (pipeline=326) which is slightly below the (1+L)-period demand implied by historical mean (~391). To align OR backend assumptions with confirmed lead time and historical demand, set L by calculation from observed lead times, and use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level (using confirmed L) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent demand has trended down from late-Feb/Mar (recent demands: 67,51,32) versus earlier higher samples. On-hand=225, in-transit=109 (total pipeline=334) which is ample versus recent demand; no outstanding overdue shipments (lead time observations show consistent 4). To avoid excess holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1) and the falling demand regime, I select lead time estimate from observed history and use recent_N (N=7) for demand mean and volatility to bias forecasts toward the recent lower-demand regime and reduce target base-stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent demand has steadily declined (Period 5-8 demands: 67,51,32,20) vs earlier volatile Jan samples. On-hand=205, in-transit=109 (total supply=314) which currently covers multiple future periods. Lead time evidence (arrivals from P1,P2,P3 all showed 4) is consistent. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime (mean of last 5 periods \u224849/week \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u2248245) so the base stock reflects the recent downshift rather than older high-variance Jan spikes. Sigma also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect reduced volatility. These choices reduce overstocking risk while keeping service for near-term demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-171.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has fallen from earlier high (historical samples mean\u224878) to a low, stable regime: last 5 realized weekly demands = [67,51,32,20,17], mean=37.4 and declining variance. On-hand=188 + in-transit=109 provides ample coverage short-term but arrivals have been consistent with confirmed lead time=4. I choose L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new lower-demand regime and avoid overweighting the early spike; mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to capture volatility of the recent regime. These settings reduce target base-stock to match current lower demand, lowering holding cost while preserving service for the recent demand level.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent on-hand=244, in-transit=40 (pipeline=284). Historical demand shows a sustained drop after Period 5: periods 6-10 demands = [51,32,20,17,13], avg=26.6/week. Lead time has been observed at 4 in concluded history. To reflect the new low-demand regime I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) covering the last 5 weeks; L is calculated from observed lead times. Sigma is estimated from the same recent window to capture current volatility. These parameters reduce excess replenishment versus using older high-demand samples while honoring confirmed lead-time behavior and the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=267, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 for past arrivals; demand has declined from late March into April (recent 5 periods: 32,20,17,13,17; mean=19.8). To keep service while avoiding extra holding (profit=holding -> fill-to-mean), set L using observed lead times (calculate). Forecast demand over the review+lead window using the most recent regime (recent_N, N=5) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters produce a base_stock close to recent demand (z*=0) and prevent excess inventory given current high on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent weeks show steady moderate demand (recent concludes: 25, ending on-hand 242, in-transit 0). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes, so use promised/default lead time. With healthy on-hand and no pipeline, use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the pipeline is empty.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13. Recent realized demand (Periods 5\u201313) is much lower and stable vs. the early-Jan spike, so I treat a lower recent-demand regime. Pipeline + on-hand = 228 on-hand + 32 in-transit; confirmed lead time evidence supports using observed lead time. Choose L by calculate to lock in observed lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent stable regime (Periods 5\u201313, 9 samples) so the OR engine bases base-stock on current lower demand and reduced volatility, reducing excess holding while maintaining service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20): on-hand=221, in-transit=32. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (recorded). Recent demand has declined (most recent 5 concluded demands: 13,17,25,14,7; avg=15.2). To avoid excess inventory given equal profit and holding cost, use a short-term recent demand estimate. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the lower recent mean over the review+lead horizon (1+L=5). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent lower volatility. This keeps target base-stock modest and reduces holding cost risk while preserving service from pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent weekly demand has settled low (last 5 demands = 17,25,14,7,6; mean\u224813.8) after an earlier spike in Jan. On-hand=215, in-transit=32 (one outstanding order). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. To avoid overstock while preserving service, set L by calculating observed lead times; set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current low-demand regime (N=5). This reduces base-stock sizing vs. using the full-sample mean which is inflated by the Jan spike.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has declined from early spikes to a stable low (last 6 concluded weekly demands: 25,14,7,6,4,4). On-hand=211, in-transit=32 \u2014 ample coverage vs. short-term demand but risk of holding cost equals profit ($1 vs $1). Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods; no evidence of further change or sustained demand regime shift. Use conservative defaults so the OR engine uses full historical mean and variance over the (1+L)=5 period review+lead window, keeping orders modest given high on-hand inventory and symmetric profit/holding costs.

Recent demand has declined vs earlier peaks; last 7 concluded demands (Periods 11\u201317) = 17,25,14,7,6,4,6, indicating a lower recent regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent demand has fallen markedly from winter peaks to a low, stable regime (~4\u201325/week over last 8 concluded periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed previously). To avoid overstock from winter samples, I set lead time to be calculated from observed lead times and base demand on the most recent low-demand regime (last 8 samples) for both mean and volatility so the OR backend targets a much lower base-stock appropriate to current demand while still covering the 1+L review+lead horizon.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed P1,P2,P3,P6,P7,P13 all arrived after 4 periods), so use calculated lead time. Inventory is ample relative to recent low demand (recent weekly demand declining to 2\u20136 units). Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples, keeping orders conservative given high holding cost (holding=$1 equals profit=$1) to avoid overstock while maintaining service for low ongoing demand.

Use promised/confirmed lead time of 4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the post\u2010March low-demand regime (use last 16 periods of observed demand) so the backend bases base_stock on the current low-demand mean/volatility rather than the earlier high pre-March samples.

On-hand = 230, in-transit = 0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time = 4 (confirmed historically). To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand and low recent demand, I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=12) so mu_hat reflects the new low-demand regime, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=12) to capture recent low volatility. L uses default (promised 4). This balances service vs. holding cost by shrinking target base-stock to recent demand levels while preserving lead-time assumption.

Lead-time observations (concluded messages) consistently show 4 periods. To avoid overstock while maintaining service, set L to be calculated from observed leads (will confirm 4). Use recent_N for demand and volatility using the most recent sustained low-demand regime (N=14 weeks) to capture the current low mean and variance rather than the early high-Jan samples. This keeps base_stock aligned with current low demand and reduces holding costs given profit=holding_cost.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=227, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a clear demand regime change: weeks P5\u2013P24 average demand ~14.45 units (n=20) versus early-sample mean 78.2. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods. To avoid overstocking given low recent demand, set L based on observed lead times, and forecast demand using the most recent 20-week regime (captures the sustained lower demand). sigma_hat also based on the same recent 20 samples to reflect current volatility. These parameters reduce target inventory relative to early high-demand samples while preserving service through the observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: avg demand decreased from 78.2 (Periods 1\u20135) to 14.45 (Periods 5\u201324), a -81.5% drop (n=20).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 5 (observed avg ~14.45 over Periods 5\u201324) versus the earlier sample mean 78.2; on-hand = 221, in-transit = 0, no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time = 4 (confirmed historically). To avoid overstock given the sustained low-demand regime, set L to default (use promised 4). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should be estimated from the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 (captures Periods 5\u201324 regime). This reduces target base-stock relative to the historical high-demand periods and minimizes holding cost while preserving service for current low demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=200, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand dropped sharply at Period 5 and has stayed at the lower regime since (low weekly sales ~0\u201325). To avoid overstating demand from the early spike, set lead time by calculation from observed arrivals and use recent_N (most recent regime) for demand estimates (N=20 capped) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained low-demand regime and avoid excess ordering/holding.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). On-hand=126, in-transit=0. Historical data and carry-over confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime drop after Period 5. Recent demand has trended upward over the last 5 weeks (Period 24\u201328 demands = 1,6,21,32,42; mean\u224820.4) suggesting a modest recovery. I retain promised lead time (default) = 4. I set mu_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture the current short-term demand level and (1+L) aggregation; this reduces bias from the earlier high-demand regime. I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility rather than historical higher variance. No in-transit arrivals are overdue (no new missing-shipment evidence). These choices bias orders toward current observed demand, balancing service (capture recent rebound) against holding cost given high holding=$1/unit.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=89, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. A sustained demand regime drop was observed (Periods 5\u201324) but recent weeks (Periods 25\u201329) show higher demand; to capture the most recent demand level I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine targets stocking to current pace while defaulting to the promised lead time. This keeps service high for the recent uptick while limiting excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent demand has rebounded after a low regime: last 5 observed demands (Periods 26\u201330) = [21,32,42,37,123], though Period 30 had stockout. On-hand=0, in-transit=49 (ordered in Period 30, arrival expected after chosen L). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. To capture the recent uptick and mitigate holding cost from older high-variance samples, forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods (recent_N N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the current regime while limiting inventory from legacy high-demand periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=168. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Demand history shows a long low-demand regime since Period 5, but recent 5 weeks (Periods 27\u201331) exhibit elevated/volatile demand including two large spikes (Periods 30\u201331). To balance service vs holding cost I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to lock in confirmed L=4, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base-stock that reflects the recent uptick while limiting exposure to stocking large quantities if spikes are short-lived. This keeps orders responsive to the latest regime without overcommitting based on older high-demand periods. Current pipeline (168) plus any order will cover part of the (1+L) demand horizon; using recent_N will let the optimizer size incremental replenishment conservatively given holding cost = profit.

Confirmed historical lead time=4 from concluded messages. To capture the recent demand spike while respecting confirmed lead time, I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the last five weeks (captures the new higher mean and increased volatility). This balances service (avoid stockouts during the spike) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the most recent regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=462. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (confirmed in carry-over). Demand shows a clear recent spike starting Period 30 (four periods of high demand: 123,139,121,216). I set L to default (promised=4, matches observed). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (use the last 4 periods to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). Sigma also uses recent_N N=4 to capture recent volatility. This biases orders up to satisfy the new higher demand while the cap prevents extreme over-ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand increased to 149.75 (Periods 30\u201333, n=4) from prior low regime (avg 14.45, Periods 5\u201324).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=637. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (Periods 30\u201333 avg \u2248149.75, n=4). Pipeline (637) is large vs recent weekly demand spike, so avoid increasing lead time or overstating demand beyond the confirmed recent regime. Set L to default (promised = 4, consistent with observed). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to target the new high-demand regime (use (1+L)*mean of last 4 samples). Use recent_N N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices focus ordering on the confirmed recent demand spike while relying on the large in-transit pipeline to limit immediate extra receipts, balancing service level and holding cost.

Demand shifted up starting Period 30; recent demands (Periods 30\u201336 = 123,139,121,216,139,104,90) show a new higher regime (mean\u2248133). Use lead time estimate from observed history and base demand on the recent high-demand regime to protect service while avoiding excess holding. Chosen methods: L from observed lead times (calculate); mu_hat use recent_N with N=7 to capture post-Period-30 regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples); sigma_hat use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=130, in-transit=447. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple arrivals show W=4). Recent demand regime uptick began at Period 30 (Periods 30\u201337 show elevated demand vs prior low regime). To capture the confirmed lead time I select calculate for L. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (covering the current high-demand regime Periods 30\u201337) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base stock matching the new regime and balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost=$1. This acknowledges substantial pipeline inventory (447) and will let the engine cap orders accordingly.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals at 4). Inventory is high: on-hand 261 + in-transit 285 = 546, while demand regime shifted up around Period 30. To avoid overstating demand from older low-regime samples, I use a recent-N demand estimate covering the post-changepoint high-demand regime (most recent 9 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 4) since concluded arrivals consistently confirm it. This lowers the risk of extra ordering given large current pipeline while still sizing orders to the recent higher-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=330, in-transit=226. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. Demand regime shifted up at Period 30; last 10 periods (P30\u2013P39) show elevated demand (mean \u2248117.7 units/week). I use the recent high-demand regime to set demand forecast: mu_hat based on the most recent 10 samples to capture the current regime (1+L periods coverage). sigma_hat uses the same recent 10 samples to reflect current volatility. Using these parameters raises target base-stock to serve the higher demand while acknowledging holding cost parity (profit=holding \u2192 z*=0).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=311, in-transit=222. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 30 (Periods 30\u201340 show consistently elevated weekly sales vs earlier low regime). Pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers near-term demand, but to align the base-stock to the new high-demand regime I use a recent-window demand estimate. Set L to promised (confirmed) lead time to match observed arrivals. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (Periods 30\u201340) to capture the current high-demand regime and volatility so the OR backend targets service with appropriate safety stock while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=320, in-transit=196 \u2192 healthy pipeline but demand regime since Period 30 shows elevated demand vs earlier low regime. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). Use promised/default lead time. For demand I focus on the post-changepoint regime starting Period 30 (recent elevated demand). Use recent_N on the last N=12 samples (Periods 30\u201341) to capture the current higher mean and volatility for (1+L) horizon. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the higher-demand regime) against holding cost by restricting the sample window to the confirmed recent regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand regime shift at Period 30 produced sustained higher demand: last 13 demands (P30\u2013P42) sum=1446, mean\u2248111.23 units/week. On-hand=214 + in-transit=151 => pipeline=365 units, but (1+L)=5 period demand \u22485\xd7111.23\u2248556 units \u2192 current pipeline insufficient. Lead time has been consistently 4 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the new high-demand regime (changepoint at P30, regime length=13). For volatility I also use recent_N N=13 to reflect recent variability. These choices raise base-stock to cover the 5-period elevated demand while sigma from recent data will size the cap conservatively given holding cost parity (profit=holding), balancing service level vs. inventory cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=222, in-transit=268 (total pipeline=490). Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand (Periods 34\u201343) is materially higher than the long-run low regime; mean demand over the last 10 periods \u224891.2/wk so I forecast across review+lead using the most recent 10 samples to capture the current elevated regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand data. Therefore use L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=10 to reflect current demand level, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=10 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost (avoid using long-run averages that understate current demand variability).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand since Period 30 shows a higher regime than the mid-year trough; on-hand=209 and in-transit=235 (total pipeline=444) which should cover multiple upcoming weeks. Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 4 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend confirms observed average lead time from concluded messages. For demand, I use recent_N with N=10 (last 10 demand observations) to capture the post-Period-30 elevated regime while avoiding overreaction to single spikes; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=10 to estimate recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during elevated demand) versus holding cost given already-large on-hand + in-transit inventory.

Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4 and recent sustained demand regime increase starting Period 30 (higher weekly sales through Period 45). No shipments appear overdue. To bias the OR engine toward current higher demand, set L to promised (default) and set demand estimates using recent data from the post-changepoint regime (Periods 30\u201345, n=16).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand since Period 30 has been elevated and volatile (periods 30\u201346 mean \u2248102 units/week, n=17) compared with earlier low regime; confirmed lead time has been 4 periods historically. On-hand=76, in-transit=345 (pipeline=421) \u2014 ample pipeline but demand remains high in this late-season window. I select L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time; for mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=17 to capture the post-Period-30 higher-demand regime (N chosen = length of the recent regime, 17 samples). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility so the OR backend will target higher base-stock to avoid stockouts during the 4-period lead time while balancing holding cost via the cap.
