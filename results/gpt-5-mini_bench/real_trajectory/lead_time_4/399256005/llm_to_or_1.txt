Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples show a rising trend (41,38,65,85,137; mean=73.2) with a large spike in the most recent week. No arrivals or in-transit inventory observed, so no evidence to change promised lead time. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand stats: L=default so backend uses promised 4-period lead time; mu_hat=default to capture (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and reflect recent average demand; sigma_hat=default to reflect overall demand variability. This conservative choice avoids overreacting to a single high week while providing the OR engine with the standard demand window.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent concluded info: Period 1 conclude shows our order (140) did not arrive yet (arrived=0). No concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time is unconfirmed; could be on-time (L=4) or delayed/lost but insufficient evidence to change. Demand history shows historical weekly samples through 2019-02-04 and a single recent realized demand=183 in Period 1 \u2014 this is one high observation but not a sustained regime change (needs >=3 periods). Given uncertainty about lead time and lack of sustained demand shift, use defaults so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/variance and the promised lead time. This avoids overreacting to a single high demand and prevents excessive inventory if the in-transit shipment is lost or delayed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent observed weekly demand (Period1=183, Period2=197) is substantially above historical Jan samples (41,38,65,85,137) suggesting a recent upward shift, but the signal is only 2 periods long (insufficient for a sustained changepoint). Orders placed in P1 and P2 have not concluded (arrived=0) \u2014 could be normal given promised lead time or delayed shipments; no concluded arrivals yet, so do not infer a lead-time change. To bias the forecast toward recent higher demand while remaining conservative, use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to weight recent sales more heavily. Keep L as default (promised lead time=4) since concluded lead-time evidence is lacking. Keep sigma_hat at default because variance estimates remain uncertain without a longer recent sample window. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service against the apparent demand uptick while avoiding overcommitment given lead-time uncertainty and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=607. Three consecutive conclude messages (P1\u2013P3) show ordered quantities but arrived=0 \u2192 no concluded arrivals observed; cannot confirm a shorter/longer lead time per rules, so keep L as promised (default). Historical demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean ~73.2; use default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean) to let backend compute the review+lead forecast. Variability will use default sigma_hat so backend applies sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This approach is conservative given possible lost/delayed shipments and preserves service-level tradeoff without overreacting to inconclusive lead-time evidence.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (140, 187, 280) have not concluded (arrived=0) across three consecutive conclude messages \u2014 potential lost/delayed shipments; monitor for confirmed arrivals before changing lead-time estimate.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): recent realized demand (Periods 1-4) is much higher (~183,197,180,210) than the older sample set, indicating a sustained upward demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=607 (orders from P1-P3) but those shipments have not concluded in three consecutive conclude messages \u2014 possible lost/delayed shipments; however arrival evidence is insufficient to confirm a lead-time change. I keep L at the promised value to avoid overcorrecting for potentially lost shipments. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 4 demand observations). This increases target base-stock to meet the higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; together they balance service level improvement against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Demand recent weeks: P1=183, P2=197, P3=180, P4=210, P5=130; historical Jan-Feb samples available. On-hand=10, in-transit=683 (matches outstanding orders). Period 5 conclude showed arrival of 140 units (ordered P1) with observed lead_time=4 \u2192 evidence actual lead time = 4. Orders from P2/P3 remain in-transit and may conclude in upcoming periods. I choose L using "calculate" so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). For demand and volatility I select "default" for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs. holding cost given confirmed LT and available pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5 conclude)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=1, in-transit=496. Recent conclude messages show orders from P1 and P2 arrived with observed lead_time=4 (P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192arrived P6) confirming actual lead time = 4. Given confirmed LT and limited volatile short-run demand, use calculated lead time (average observed) to reflect evidence and use default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples\u2014this avoids overfitting to the small recent dip in Period 5 while letting the backend compute service-level-aware base stock.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent realized demand (Periods 4-7 = 210,130,196,317) is far above the historical pre-sample mean (2019 Jan samples mean=73.2). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in recent concludes. On-hand=0, in-transit=384 (covers upcoming arrivals but we still must plan for (1+L) demand). I set L to default (promised 4) because concludes confirm 4-period lead time. I forecast demand using recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime and reduce stockouts; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (given high demand) while relying on confirmed lead-time evidence and recent demand samples to avoid underordering after prior delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean (2019 Jan samples) = 73.2; recent Periods 4-7 mean = 213.25 (+191%), sustained over 4 periods

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (three concluded arrivals from Periods 1\u20133 with lead_time=4) and a sustained demand regime shift: Periods 4\u20137 mean demand = 213.25 (vs historical mean 73.2). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=725 (these in-transit units include arrivals that concluded in P5\u2013P7). To capture the confirmed lead time, use calculated lead time so backend uses observed average. To reflect the sustained higher demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (regime length=4) so (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the new regime; this increases orders to satisfy higher expected demand while the OR cap controls over-ordering given holding cost equals profit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent weeks show a sustained higher demand regime vs. historical Jan samples (recent Periods 4\u20137 avg \u2248213 vs historical 73.2). Lead-time observations in concluded messages consistently show 4 periods (orders from P1,P2,P3,P5 all concluded with W=4). Current inventory: on-hand=23, in-transit=875 (large pipeline). To reflect the confirmed lead time and the sustained higher-demand regime, set L via observed average and forecast demand using the recent regime (short recent window). This prevents underordering for the new higher demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency; sigma set from the same recent window to capture recent volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded messages (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P5\u2192P9). On-hand=0, in-transit=1201 \u2014 large pipeline already covers multiple periods. Historical Jan samples show low mean (73.2) but a sustained demand regime shift was observed earlier (Periods 4\u20137 avg \u2248213). To respect confirmed lead time and recent elevated demand, set L to default (promise=4). Forecast demand using recent_N on the most recent sustained high-demand regime length (N=4) to capture the higher mean while avoiding dilution by older low-demand samples. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices keep the OR backend targeting higher service (larger base_stock) appropriate for the shifted demand while the large in-transit position limits aggressive additional orders.

Recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple confirmations); demand has shifted up since Period 4 (recent periods 4\u201311 mean ~213 vs historical ~73). To protect service during the higher-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and set demand forecasts using recent_N=8 (Periods 4\u201311) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current high-demand regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): recent demand remains well above historical Jan samples. Recent demand (Periods 5-12) = [130,196,317,273,193,236,236,250], mean=228.88; confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals). On-hand+in-transit = 91+779=870 units, which is below coverage needed for (1+L)=5 periods at recent mean (~1,144 units), so parameters should target the new higher-demand regime while using observed lead time. Set L via calculate to use observed lead times (all concluded = 4). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime (N=8 covers Periods 5-12 where demand averaged 228.88). This increases recommended base-stock to reduce expected lost sales while sigma based on recent variability raises safety stock appropriately. Continuing to monitor conclude messages for any delayed/lost shipments before changing L.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Current on-hand=281, in-transit=688. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, etc.), matching promised lead time. Demand elevated vs Jan baseline: recent periods (P4\u2013P13) show sustained higher demand (many weeks >200). To capture the recent high-demand regime while remaining responsive, use promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on recent samples. I choose recent_N with N=8 to cover the most recent two-month window (captures the sustained uplift while smoothing week-to-week noise). Apply the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These settings give the OR backend a (1+L)-period forecast centered on recent demand, improving service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while accounting for observed variability and avoiding overcommitment to older low-demand samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent periods show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 4 (periods 4\u201314 demand average >> historical Jan samples) and multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. On-hand=371, in-transit=567 which plus expected arrivals covers near-term demand. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed LT=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (regime from Period 4\u201314 length=11) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the high-demand regime; this increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts while accounting for elevated variability and holding cost tradeoff.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=156, in-transit=671. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals with lead_time=4); several earlier ordered shipments were delayed but subsequently arrived on a 4-period cadence. Demand shifted up starting Period 4 and has remained elevated through Period 15. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (regime from Period 4\u201315, 12 weeks) to capture the sustained higher mean and variance; same recent_N N=12 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward the higher recent demand while using observed lead time to avoid underordering given past delays.

Use promised/confirmed lead time (default). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime observed from Periods 4\u201316 and to avoid diluting the forecast with low-Jan samples. Use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving 4 periods after order (multiple confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Demand shows a sustained regime shift to higher weekly demand (recent Periods 4\u20137 avg=213.25 vs historical Jan avg=73.2); use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new regime (N=4 equals detected recent regime length). These choices ensure the OR backend targets inventory for the higher recent demand while using observed lead-time behavior to size the replenishment pipeline; using recent statistics also helps mitigate understock risk from the confirmed demand increase while the large in-transit stock is consumed.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has settled into a higher regime since Period 8; last 11 concluded demands (P8\u2013P18) average \u2248246 units/week so (1+L)=5 \u21d2 5\xd7mean \u22481,231 demand across review+lead. On-hand=0, in-transit=1,019 \u2014 pipeline nearly covers the 5-period demand but short by \u2248212 units. Multiple concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and shipments are arriving reliably, so use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime (recent_N with N=11) to reflect the sustained higher mean/volatility and avoid understocking; this balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost. No new lost-shipment signal currently (in-transit is large and recent arrivals have matched promised L).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 8 (recent mean ~213/week vs historical Jan mean 73.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=1054 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple weeks at current demand and no outstanding unconfirmed arrivals past promised LT. I therefore keep L as default (promised 4). To capture the sustained regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (covers Periods 8\u201319, regime length ~12), so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, which raises target base-stock to meet higher demand while using recent volatility for proper safety stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). Demand has shifted to a higher regime vs. Jan samples (recent sustained elevated weekly demand). On-hand=125 and large in-transit=918 \u2014 pipeline is ample so avoid inflating forecast from long-ago low samples. Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 4 demand periods), which balances service-level needs against holding cost given the already-large pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (many orders with lead_time=4). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting around Period 8; recent demand (Periods 8\u201321) remains elevated. To reflect confirmed lead time I use calculate (average observed lead times). To capture the elevated demand regime I use recent_N with N=14 (covering Periods 8\u201321) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent regime. This keeps orders responsive to the higher demand while relying on observed lead-time behavior to avoid underordering given past delayed/lost shipments.

Demand has sustained higher regime (~200+ per period since Period 4\u20137 shift); to capture recent behavior I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat (focus on latest demand regime). I choose N=5 to weight the most recent 5 demand observations for the (1+L)-period demand forecast. Volatility estimated from the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N N=5) so safety stock reflects current variability.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=280, in-transit=626 \u2014 healthy pipeline but demand has been at an elevated regime since Period 8 (recent weeks ~180\u2013288). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages, so use observed-average for L. To capture the sustained higher demand and recent variability, use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes a base-stock reflecting the elevated regime while limiting overreaction to very short blips. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long lead time) versus holding cost by using a recent-window forecast rather than all-history or an explicit large forecast.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Historical demand shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning around Period 8 (user note: recent Periods 4-7 mean=213.25 and subsequent periods maintain high weekly demand ~180\u2013317). Promised lead time is 4 and past concludes consistently confirm a 4-period actual lead time. To capture the post-changepoint demand level I use a recent_N demand estimate covering the sustained regime (Periods 8\u201324 \u2248 17 periods) so the OR engine sizes base stock to the current higher mean; matching sigma to the same window captures recent volatility. Using recent-window estimates increases service (reduces stockouts) while the backend\u2019s cap prevents runaway orders given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=367, in-transit=628. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Demand has clearly shifted up from the Jan baseline (mean 73.2) to a higher sustained regime since Period 4\u20138 (recent mean ~213). To capture the current high-demand regime I set L to default (use promised 4) because concluded history confirms 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=18 (covering the most recent sustained regime from ~Period 8 onward) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and volatility reflecting the elevated demand and variability; this balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been well above the Jan baseline: sustained high-demand regime since Period 8 (weekly demand typically ~180\u2013290). On-hand=414, in-transit=546 provides a healthy pipeline but demand remains elevated. Actual lead time has repeatedly concluded at 4 periods; use observed lead-time average. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to capture the higher regime (use last 19 periods since the changepoint around Period 8) so the backend sizes base stock for the elevated demand while the pipeline covers outstanding needs. This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) and holding cost (we use recent_N to reflect current volatility).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods and a sustained demand regime increase observed earlier (Periods 4-7). Current inventory: on-hand=400, in-transit=596 \u2192 pipeline_inventory=996 which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand given historical demand levels; no evidence of new changepoint in demand or lead time in the most recent periods. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimators so the OR backend applies historical-sample-based base-stock and volatility; this avoids overreacting to earlier regime shift while current pipeline is ample and helps balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 and demand has shifted to a higher regime (sustained elevated weekly sales since Period 4). Current inventory is healthy (on-hand 508, in-transit 319) but demand remains elevated vs. early 2019 samples. I set L to calculate so backend uses observed lead-time history (will be ~4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 weeks (captures the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing noise). This keeps base-stock aligned to elevated demand while limiting overreaction to single-period spikes, balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=496, in-transit=450. Historical arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods consistently (multiple concluded messages). Demand has been elevated relative to Jan samples earlier, but recent pipeline + on-hand (946 units) comfortably covers several weeks of typical demand. To keep policy aligned with promised lead time and the OR engine's expectations, I use default lead time and default demand estimates (which use all samples) so the backend computes base-stock from its full-sample mean/variance. This avoids overfitting to short-term fluctuations while the pipeline remains healthy and avoids unnecessary holding cost increases.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders: P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Recent demand regime increased relative to the Jan baseline; to capture the current demand level I use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the sustained higher demand observed across recent periods while keeping volatility from full history. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent demand regime and smooth short-term noise; sigma_hat remains default to let backend use overall volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given on-hand+in-transit) against holding cost given already-large on-hand inventory.

Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (many concluded arrivals show W=4), so set L to calculated average of observed lead times. Recent demand has moderated from the earlier high regime; to capture the latest demand regime I use a recent_N estimate (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight recent weeks (captures demand from P24\u2013P31).

Lead times have been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=495 and in-transit=326 (pipeline=821) is ample relative to the recent demand regime. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, keep L as default (promised 4) and set demand forecast using a recent_N estimate (N=4) to capture the latest low-demand regime; apply recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect current volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Inventory high: on-hand=549, in-transit=255 \u2192 pipeline=804 units. Historical lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in history); promised LT=4. Recent demand has declined from the earlier spike: last 5 realized demands (Periods 30-34) = [95,76,74,87,65], mean \u224879.4, lower volatility than earlier spike. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep L at promised (default) and forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods to reflect the current lower regime: mu_hat \u2192 recent_N (N=5). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent lower variability. This reduces target base-stock relative to the earlier high-demand regime and avoids adding inventory while substantial pipeline exists.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=625, in-transit=135. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed in Period 6 onward). Early 2019 showed a temporary demand spike (Periods 4-7) but more recent weeks (Periods 28-35) show much lower demand (~87 units/week). Given large on-hand inventory and recent lower demand, use the promised lead time (default) and recent demand statistics to avoid overordering. I select recent_N=8 (last 8 demand samples, Periods 28-35) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets replenishment appropriate to current lower-demand regime while the default L=4 preserves correct arrival timing; this also guards against reacting to the earlier transient spike and mitigates risk from previously delayed/lost shipments by retaining conservative ordering.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=586, in-transit=135. Observed lead time consistently 4 in concluded history; no recent prolonged delays. Recent demand has trended lower vs. earlier spikes; I use a short recent window to capture current lower-demand regime. Choose L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base forecast on the last 5 demand observations, and sigma_hat=default to let backend scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost given high on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. On-hand=535, in-transit=135. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (many orders show lead_time=4) so set L by calculation of observed lead times. Recent demand has fallen vs. the large spike earlier; last 6 concluded demands (Periods 32-37) = [74,87,65,44,39,51] indicate a lower recent regime. To keep pipeline aligned with current demand while avoiding excess holding cost, I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the current low-demand regime) and let L be calculated from observed lead times so the OR backend uses the confirmed 4-period behavior.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=594, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods (confirmed in history), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (many periods since spring) is lower than the early-Jan spike; with a large on-hand position I avoid increasing forecast to prevent holding cost. Use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (keeps policy conservative given high current inventory). No evidence of new sustained regime shifts or lost shipments since lead time=4 has been repeatedly confirmed.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=547, in-transit=206. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed in Period 6), so use promised lead time. Recent weeks show subdued demand (~40\u201380/week) versus an earlier spike; no new sustained regime change. To avoid overreacting to past spikes and because profit=holding (symmetric), use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and scaled std from all samples; this keeps service-risk balanced without inflating orders despite current large on-hand inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=475, in-transit=240. Historical actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed in history). Recent demand (Periods 33-40) is low and stable (~39\u201376/week), well below the earlier spring spike. To avoid excess holdings while preserving service, keep L as default (promised 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower-demand regime; I choose N=8 (most recent 8 concluded demand observations) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and scales volatility from recent data. This reduces target base stock vs. using the high-spike historical mean and limits holding cost given current high on-hand inventory and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-11-25: Recent weekly demand has fallen from the mid-200s earlier in year to ~50-80 in recent periods (Periods 32-41). On-hand=427, in-transit=240 (pipeline total=667) which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand at current low run-rate. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (no recent evidence of loss). I set L via calculate to let backend confirm avg observed lead time=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the recent low-demand regime (changepoint around Period 32; recent regime length ~10 weeks). This reduces forecasted order quantities vs the earlier high-demand regime and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service. N=10 chosen as regime_length capped by available samples and >=3.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. Recent concluded lead-times have been consistently 4; no strong evidence of persistent lost shipments now. On-hand=258, in-transit=240 (pipeline ample). Recent demand (Periods ~31-42) is lower than the early-2019 spike; I use a recent-N forecast to reflect the current lower-demand regime and reduce needless stocking given equal profit and holding costs. Set L to promised (default=4) and use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service appropriate to the last ~3 months of demand.

Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 periods; use observed average. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 12 weeks to capture the current lower-demand regime (N=12).

Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and recent demand (Periods 32\u201344) is moderate compared with the early 2019 spike; no new sustained changepoint detected. I keep L as default (promised 4) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses full-sample estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This leverages confirmed lead-time evidence and long-run demand stats while avoiding overreacting to short-term fluctuations given high on-hand inventory.

Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; several earlier periods showed a temporary high-demand regime but subsequent weeks returned to lower, stable weekly demand. Pipeline (373+286=659) comfortably covers multiple weeks of typical demand, so keep promised lead time and default demand estimates to avoid overreacting to past spikes. I select default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), balancing service and holding cost given current ample inventory.

Date 2019-12-30. Recent observed weekly demand has fallen (Dec weeks: 29, 16) after earlier 2019 spring spike; current on-hand=357 and in-transit=361 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 4 and prior concludes confirm actual LT=4. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service with large pipeline, use default lead time and default demand estimates (backend uses full-sample mean/variance across (1+L) periods). This lets the OR engine cap orders given current pipeline and balances profit vs holding cost.
