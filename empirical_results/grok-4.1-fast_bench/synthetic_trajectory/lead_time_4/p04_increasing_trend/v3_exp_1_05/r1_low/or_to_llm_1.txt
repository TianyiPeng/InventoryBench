Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=2900 units breakdown - Period 44 order 850 arrives during Period 48; P45 order 950 arrives P49; P46 1100 arrives P50; P47 0 arrives P51 (irrelevant). Demand analysis: Surge persists and strengthens; recent P43-P47 demands (774,845,919,930,986) avg 891 (upward trend, +6% vs P42-P46 avg 842), far exceeding early P1-P4 avg 97. Expected D48 ~1000+ (extrapolating trend), so P48 arrival 850 likely sells all with ~150 stockout; P49 950 vs ~1050 stockout ~100; P50 1100 vs ~1100 balanced. OR recommendation: 0 units - reasonable given full-history low mean (~400-500?) underestimates surge, but high pipeline relative to its mu_hat + promised L=4 leads to no order need. Adjustment: Follow 0 exactly - Period 48 order arrives during P52 (after game ends at P50), providing zero sales/profit benefit and potential holding risk if charged; prior decisions (P47 order=0) align.
