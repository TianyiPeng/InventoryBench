No calendar/product seasonality signals (generic periods, regular chips). OR recommendation: 174 units (base-stock over L+1=5 periods using full history; q=0.5 implies z\u22480, target ~5*mean; cap smooths swings). Strategy: Follow OR as it aligns precisely with recent demand avg 174.8; uncapped need ~875-392=483 but cap at 174 prevents excess holding (profit=holding=1); covers expected ~175*5=875 with position building conservatively (post-order position=392+174=566; incoming fills gaps). No overrides needed.",
