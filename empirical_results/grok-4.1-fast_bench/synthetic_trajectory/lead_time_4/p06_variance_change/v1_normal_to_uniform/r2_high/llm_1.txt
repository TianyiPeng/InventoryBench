Early history ~90-100 avg. (c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (e.g., P44 arrive from P40, P43 from P39); in-transit 300 = P41 order, due P45; no overdue/lost orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: Starting P45 on-hand=1269; +300 arrive P45 (pre-demand); future: P46=0(P42 ord), P47=0(P43), P48=0(P44), P49=our ord, P50=P46 ord. Total pipeline covers >>6 periods even at 200/period (1200). (e) Order logic: Endgame (6 periods left); excess inventory (1569+ post-P45 arrival) vs. low/volatile demand (~50-100 avg); order 0 minimizes holding costs ($1/unit/period) while ensuring service.",
