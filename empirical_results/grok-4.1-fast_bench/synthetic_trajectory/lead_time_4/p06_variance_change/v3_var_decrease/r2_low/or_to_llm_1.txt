Demand analysis: Stable low-volatility regime sustained P30-P49 avg~102 (P40-P49:101.9; P47-P49:111.7 with P48=135 outlier); aligns with carry-over ~97 avg, low std~12 extended. No calendar/product seasonality cues. OR rec=163 uses full history (inflated by early highs like P1=145,P2=134,P4=223), mu_hat~(1+4)*higher_mean, but capped. Strategy: Pipeline position=121 covers <2 periods (need ~500 for 5 periods @100/period); recent partial stockouts P47-P49 confirm need to replenish. Follow OR 163 as prudent build-up given thin pipeline, stable demand outlook, and OR's safety/cap despite higher historical mean.",
