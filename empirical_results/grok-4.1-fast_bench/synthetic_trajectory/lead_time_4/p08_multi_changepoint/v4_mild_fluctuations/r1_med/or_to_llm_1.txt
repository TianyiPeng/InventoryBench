Demand analysis: Recent moderation sustained (P39-43 avg 82, vs prior peaks; P43=89 shows slight uptick but volatile, no new regime shift). No calendar dates or seasonal drivers provided for chips(Regular). With 7 periods remaining (P44-P50), expected demand ~85*7=595; committed supply to P47=458 leaves ~137 gap, to be covered by P44-P46 orders (arriving P48-P50). OR recommendation: 87 units, based on historical mean/std over promised LT=4 (\u03bc\u0302~5*85?, safety-adjusted base-stock minus pipeline).
