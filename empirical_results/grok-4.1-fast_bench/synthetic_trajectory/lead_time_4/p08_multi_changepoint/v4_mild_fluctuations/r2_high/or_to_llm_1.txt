{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed as 4 periods consistently (latest P49 arrived=90 from P45 order; P48 arrived=72 from P44; no lost shipments evident). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=71, in-transit=117 (P46 order=117 arriving P50). Scheduled arrivals: P50=117 (P46), P51=0 (P47), P52=0 (P48), P53=0 (P49), P54=this order. Projections (demand~100 avg): P50 start=188, end~88; P51 start=88, sold~88 end=0 lost~12; P52 start=0 lost~100; P53 start=0 lost~100. Critical stockout risk P52-P53 due to recent zero orders. Demand analysis: Recent P45-P49 avg=103 (116,102,91,124,80) sd~16 (+18% vs P36-P44 avg~87), volatile uptick softening prior drop regime (P36-P47 avg~91); full history early~80, P16-P35~118 high, now ~100 post-drop with spikes. No calendar/seasonal cues (generic periods). OR recommendation: 140 units (capped base-stock using full history \u03bc~95?, promised L=4, total pipeline=188; raw likely higher but capped ~\u03bc_bar +1.645\u03c3_bar~100+30=130). Strategy: Override OR cap upward to 150 - smooth pipeline timing gaps (bunched P50, zeros P51-P53 like past P47 gap), target coverage for volatile ~103 demand (5x=515 + safety~70=585; raw~585-188=397, but moderate uncap to 150 avoids excess hold while prioritizing stockout avoidance (19 profit loss >>1 hold)).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 140 to 150 units - imminent P52-P53 stockout risk (~200 lost sales) from P47-P49 zero orders creating pipeline gaps; recent P45-P49 demand avg 103 (+18% vs prior drop) with sd~16 requires stronger replenishment beyond OR cap.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand uptick sustained P45-P49: avg 103 (+18% vs P36-P44 ~87), 5 periods sd~16 (116,102,91,124,80) softening drop regime; Pipeline gap: P47-P49 orders=0 arrive P51-P53 risking ~200 stockout lost sales similar to past (P23=0 at P27, P40=0 at P44)",
