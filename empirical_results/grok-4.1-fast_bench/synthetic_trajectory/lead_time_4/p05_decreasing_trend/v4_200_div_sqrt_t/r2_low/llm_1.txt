{
  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates provided; 'chips(Regular)' is a staple snack with no strong seasonal drivers evident. (b) Demand regime remains low per carry-over insights (recent downward shifts to avg ~27-44); P40-49 demands avg 34.7 (range 1-63, volatile but stable mean around 35, no sustained shift up/down vs prior). (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (last confirmed P25->P29); no in-transit orders, none overdue/missing. (d) On-hand 425 (post-P49), in-transit 0; ample coverage (~12 periods at 35/day forecast). (e) Excess inventory vs low demand; order 0 to minimize holding costs (P=H=$1), no stockout risk over lead time + buffer.",
