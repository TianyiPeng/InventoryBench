(b) Demand regime analysis: Historical samples (P1:204, P2:155, P3:134, P4:72, P5:108) show mean of 134.6 units/period, high variance (std ~48), initial decline then stabilization around 100-150; no sustained regime shift evident yet, forecast ~140/period. (c) Lead_time vs. missing orders: Promised 4 periods; no 'conclude' messages yet (Period 1 start), so cannot infer actual lead time or losses; assume promised until evidence. (d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; completely empty, so Periods 1-4 (pre-first arrival) face certain stockouts; pipeline build starts with this order arriving ~Period 5. (e) Final order logic: Target base-stock policy for (lead+1)=5 periods coverage at \u03bc=140 \u2192 700 units, adjusted down to 600 for conservatism given high holding cost (=profit), variance, and early stockout inevitability; builds pipeline without excessive risk.",

(c) Lead time consistently 4 periods across all arrivals (e.g., P38 order arrived P42, P29-P33); no in-transit orders; any order in P47 arrives P51 (post-game end at P50), effectively lost. (d) On-hand=405 (high); no pipeline; covers remaining 4 periods (P47-50) at ~30/period (~120 total) with massive excess (~285 buffer), holding cost $1/unit/period hurts but inevitable with excess. (e) Order 0: No need to replenish (excess inventory), order would arrive post-game (useless for sales, no holding charged pre-arrival).",
