Projection for remaining 8 periods (to P50): Expected total demand ~840 (@105/period); current supply (2+350)=352 covers ~3.4 periods, necessitating replenishment for P47+ (4 periods ~420). OR baseline: 199 likely overestimates due to inclusion of prior high-demand eras (P13-25 ~180avg); adjust down for recency-weighted low mean/volatility. Strategy: Order 150 to target base-stock ~105*5=525 + safety~100 (z~0.84 for q=0.8) minus projected pipeline depletion, avoiding excess holding while covering endgame stockouts (arrives P47 as buffer).",
