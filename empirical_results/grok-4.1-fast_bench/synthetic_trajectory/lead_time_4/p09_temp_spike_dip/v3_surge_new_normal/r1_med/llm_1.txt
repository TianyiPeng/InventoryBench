Early periods stable ~130 avg (P1-P4), P5 drop to 59 possibly anomaly (insufficient evidence for shift). Forecast ~120-130/period absent new data.\n(c) Lead_time vs. missing orders: Promised 4 periods; no 'conclude' messages in history (Period 1 start), cannot infer actual LT or losses yet. No in-transit.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 demand fully unmet (stockout). Order now builds pipeline: P1 order arrives during P5 arrival (visible P5 conclude, read P6). No coverage until P5.\n(e) Final order logic: Order initial pipeline fill for P5 demand at historical early avg (129, P1-P4) rounded to 130. Prioritizes service from P5+ (profit $4 >> holding $1); subsequent orders will refine forecast/LT. Covers ~1 period demand + minor safety vs variance.",
