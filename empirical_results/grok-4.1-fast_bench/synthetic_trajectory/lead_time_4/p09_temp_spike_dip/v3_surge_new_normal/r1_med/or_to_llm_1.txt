Demand analysis: Sustained low regime P26+ per carry-over (avg ~120), confirmed by recent P30-49 (20 periods, sum=2472, avg=123.6, std dev ~20); stable, no regime shift (recent P46-49 avg=126). Full historical avg ~146 (higher due to P15-25 spike), but recency prioritized. No calendar dates or product seasonality cues. OR recommendation: 238 units (capped base-stock policy using full history mu_bar~146, higher variance inflating cap ~238); their target IP ~370 (=132+238), reasonable for ~5*146=730 mu_hat but conservative given cap smooths rebuild. Strategy: Follow OR unchanged - low IP requires replenishment to rebuild IP gradually and avoid boom-bust cycle seen post-P25 (huge buildup); aligns with sustained low demand (~124 vs. OR ~146 close enough), prioritizes avoiding prolonged future stockouts over minor overestimation. Order 238 brings IP to ~370 (~3 periods coverage post-arrival), prudent with profit=4 vs hold=1.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 238 units - inventory position critically low at 132 (imminent stockouts P51-P53 unavoidable), need gradual replenishment under sustained low demand regime (P26-49 avg ~124); OR cap appropriate to rebuild without excess holding risk as in past drop.",
