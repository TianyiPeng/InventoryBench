(e) Final order logic: Replenish for P35+ coverage (lead time=4); order 300 = 75*4 (lead time demand coverage), provides buffer post-arrival (~4 periods coverage + safety vs volatility); avoids excess holding given current high on-hand depleting soon; balances lost sales risk ($4 profit) vs holding ($1/period).",
