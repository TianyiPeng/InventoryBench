{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed reliably 4 periods, e.g., Period 45 order arrived Period 49 (lead_time=4), Period 42 order arrived Period 46, consistent with all recent concluded arrivals and carry-over insights; no lost shipments evident as all tracked orders have arrived on time. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=6 (critically low). In-transit=780 breaks down as: P50 arrival=400 (P46 order), P51=0 (P47 order=0), P52=380 (P48=380), P53=0 (P49=0), P54=our order. Post-P50: ~406 start minus ~300 demand \u2192 ~106 end; P51 vulnerable (106-300 stockout); P52 bolstered by 380; P53 vulnerable again. Demand analysis: Sustained high regime P16-49 avg ~290 (+190% vs P1-15 ~100), recent P47-49: 313/311/316 avg 313 (+8% vs regime avg), volatility present but no sustained moderation (prior P40-46 signal overridden); chips(Regular) no calendar/dates provided, but pattern indicates ongoing elevated demand ~300/period. Expected 5-period (1+L) demand ~1500. OR recommendation: 384 units (capped base-stock policy using full history mean likely ~220 diluted by early lows, underestimates current regime). Strategy: Slightly override OR up to 400 to target base-stock ~1500, accounting for regime shift OR misses, pipeline gaps (P51/P53), and recent highs; ensures coverage through P54+ while respecting cap spirit (OR cap likely ~380); minimizes holding given low on-hand.",
