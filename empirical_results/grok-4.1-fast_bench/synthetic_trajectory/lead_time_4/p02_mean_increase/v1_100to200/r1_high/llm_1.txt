(b) Demand regime: historical shows initial high (141) dropping to lower levels (avg post-P2 ~87); no sustained regime shift evident yet; forecast ~100/period conservatively. (c) Lead time: promised 4 periods; no 'conclude' messages or arrivals observed yet (Period 1 start), cannot infer actual LT or losses.
