Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed consistently as 4 periods across history, including latest Period 49 arrival of 216 units from Period 45 order (49-45=4); no lost shipments evident, all concludes match. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 16 + in-transit 220 (Period 46 order=220 arriving Period 50) = position 236; expected arrivals Period 51-53: 0 (orders P47-P49=0); Period 50 order arrives Period 54. This covers Period 50 strongly (~236 vs ~200 demand \u2192 ~36 leftover), but exposes P51-P53 to stockouts (3x~200=600 needed vs ~36). Demand analysis: Recent P44-P49: 241,194,149,214,208,200 (avg 201, volatile with one low at 149); aligns with sustained high demand since P14 (avg ~190 per carry-over), post temporary decrease P40-P43 (avg 170, not sustained as P44+ rebounded). Full history early low (~93 avg P1-P13), but regime shift long confirmed. No calendar/product seasonality cues. OR recommendation: 270 units (capped base-stock using full history mean ~lower than recent, promised L=4). Strategy: Override upward to 300 as recent avg 201 > OR baseline; adds safety for volatility and low post-P50 pipeline without excessive holding (q=0.5 fractile balanced); ensures ~536 position post-order for 5-period horizon (~1000 demand).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 270 to 300 units - recent P44-P49 avg demand 201 exceeds historical baseline used by OR, with critically low pipeline for P51-P53 risking stockouts.",
