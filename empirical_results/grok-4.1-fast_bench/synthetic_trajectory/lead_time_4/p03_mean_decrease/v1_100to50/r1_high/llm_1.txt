  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates or specific product seasonal drivers provided; regular chips demand typically stable but observed long-term downward shift. (b) Demand regime downward shift sustained (P17-P48 avg ~48 vs early ~100); recent P43-P48: 26,42,42,38,60,64 (avg 45.3), fluctuating but mean ~45-50, no new regime shift (recent uptick P47-48 not sustained 3+ periods). (c) Lead time confirmed 4 periods consistently (multiple observations e.g. P27 order arrived P31); no in-transit, no overdue/missing orders. (d) On-hand 228 sufficient for ~4 periods at ~50/period demand; covers remaining P49-P50 fully (expected ~100 total demand); pipeline empty. (e) Order 0: lead time 4 means P49 order arrives P53 (post-game end at P50); ample stock avoids excess holding while ensuring no stockout; maximizes profit by selling existing inventory.",

  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates or seasonal events provided; chips(Regular) is a steady snack product with no indicated spikes. (b) Demand regime remains low since P17 (carry-over avg ~48 over P17-P26, extended evidence); recent P40-P49: demands [65,44,50,26,42,42,38,60,64,41], avg 47.2, sd~12.5, consistent no new shift. Forecast ~48/period. (c) Lead time confirmed 4 periods (multiple arrivals e.g. P28 order arrived P32); in-transit=0, no overdue/missing orders.
