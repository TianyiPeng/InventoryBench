Recent P36-45 demands avg=131 (sum=1309/10), with volatility (highs 184,186,156,156; lows 62,90) and frequent stockouts (e.g., P45 demand=156>sold=155; P41=186>130; P39=184>101). Last 4 periods (P42-45) avg=118 but includes P45 spike=156, aligning with high regime. Pre-game historical (avg~106) irrelevant per carry-over. No calendar dates or product seasonality cues.
