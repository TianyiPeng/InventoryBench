Overall recent 10-period avg ~121, last 5 ~131, last 3 ~105; forecast ~110-120 balancing recent moderation and high variance. (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 44 concluded periods (e.g., P44 order arrived P44); no in-transit or lost orders. (d) On-hand 55, in-transit 0; starting supply for P45 = 55 + order (arrives same period pre-demand). (e) Order 65 to target supply ~120 (covers forecast mean, safety for highs ~130-180 while limiting excess on potential low ~50-60; symmetric costs favor matching expected demand given lead 0 and 6 periods left).",
