(c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 46 concluded periods (every arrival matches order period); no in-transit or overdue/missing orders. (d) On-hand 43, in-transit 0; covers recent lows (e.g., 13,64) but risks stockout on medians (~75) or spikes (~30-40% prob >80 in recent samples). Pipeline empty. With LT=0, order arrives before demand. (e) Multi-period newsvendor approximation (LT=0, lost sales, profit=holding=1): target median demand ~75 (recent P41-46 median74). Order 75-43=32; round conservatively to 35 accounting for end-game (4 periods left, excess holds fewer periods but spikes possible). Balances stockout risk vs holding.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) chips(Regular): standard snack chips, demand volatile with no calendar dates provided, so no seasonal or event-driven adjustments; steady vending demand around 80-150 units typically.

(c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 47 periods (every order arrives same period, e.g., P47: ordered=35 arrived=35 Period47); no in-transit, no overdue/lost orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; P47 ended 0 after demand=125>starting78; no arrivals pending for P48 pre-decision. (e) Final order logic: LT=0 so order covers P48 demand directly (arrives before demand); forecast ~100 (recent avg98, aligns post-P35 low~92 regime + volatility); order 120 for safety vs highs (e.g., P47=125,P45=163) balancing stockout loss ($1) vs holding ($1/period, but LT=0 allows quick adjust P49); endgame (48/50) favors service level.",
