{
  "rationale": "(a) World knowledge and product: 'chips(Regular)' is a standard snack item with steady, non-seasonal demand in a vending machine context; no calendar dates provided beyond sequential periods, so no major events or seasonality to anchor (e.g., no holidays, back-to-school). Demand driven by typical consumer patterns, variable but mean-reverting around 90-110 units. (b) Demand regime analysis: Historical demand stable over 49 periods (mean ~95, std ~20); recent 10 periods (P40-49) avg 96.4 (range 60-120), last 5 avg ~105; occasional spikes (120-136, ~10% of periods) but no sustained shift (e.g., no 3+ period trend up/down >20%). Use forecast ~100-110 with safety for upside. (c) Lead-time vs. missing orders: Confirmed actual LT=0 consistently across all 49 periods (every conclude: 'lead_time was 0 periods'); no in-transit or overdue orders (IT=0). (d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: OH=1 (very low from P49 ending), IT=0; no pipeline coverage. Post-order arrival (LT=0): starting_inv = 1 + order_qty; must cover P50 demand.
