  "rationale": "(a) World knowledge and product: 'chips(Regular)' is a standard snack chip SKU with steady, non-seasonal demand drivers; no calendar dates provided beyond period numbers, so no major retail events or seasonality to anticipate (e.g., no holidays, back-to-school). Historical samples (P1-5 avg ~97) align with baseline snack demand. (b) Demand regime analysis: Confirmed high-demand regime post-P34 (~110 avg P36-41 per carry-over), sustained into recent periods with avg ~101 over P36-46 (sum=1111/11 periods); minor dip in last 4 (P43-46: 72,105,80,80 avg 84) but not sustained shift (insufficient 3+ periods evidence of new low regime); forecast P47 ~95 (blend recent 84-101 avg, conservative vs high variance 70-120). (c) Lead-time vs missing orders: Actual lead time consistently 0 periods across all 46 concluded periods (every order arrives same period, e.g., P46: ordered P46 arrived P46); no in-transit or lost orders (current in-transit=0). (d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=56 (from P46 end), in-transit=0; covers ~0.6 periods at forecast 95, vulnerable to stockout without order; 4 periods remain (47-50), cumulative reward sensitive to stockouts (lost profit) vs holding. (e) Final order logic: Target start-inv ~115 (forecast 95 +20 safety for variance/endgame buffer, low holding since profit=holding=$1); order=115-56=59 \u2192 round to 60; avoids stockout risk while minimizing excess (expected end ~20, adjustable next periods via lead=0).",
