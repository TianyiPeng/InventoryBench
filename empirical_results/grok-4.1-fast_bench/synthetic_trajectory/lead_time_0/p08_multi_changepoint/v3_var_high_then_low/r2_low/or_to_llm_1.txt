{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All 49 concluded periods show 'lead_time was 0 periods' consistently (e.g., Period 49: ordered=63 arrived=63 on Period 49), matching promised L=0; no lost shipments or delays observed. Inventory status: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no pipeline coverage for Period 50 demand. Demand analysis: Full history shows high variability (spikes like 256 in P35, lows like 0 in P31, 42 in P34), but recent 10 periods (P40-49) average 92.6 (range 64-129), aligning with early history avg ~97; no sustained regime shift or seasonality (no real calendar dates). OR recommendation: 103 units, using all-history empirical mean/std with L=0, critical fractile-based base-stock (q=0.5), and cap; appropriate for 1-period horizon with safety stock for \u03c3. Strategy: Follow OR exactly - covers expected demand ~95 + safety (~8 units), avoids overstock (holding=profit), given consistent L=0 and stable patterns.",
