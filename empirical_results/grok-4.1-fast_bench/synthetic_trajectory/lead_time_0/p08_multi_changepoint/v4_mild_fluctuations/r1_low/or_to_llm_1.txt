No lost shipments; all orders arrive same period before demand. Inventory status: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so order for Period 20 will arrive immediately and cover this period's demand entirely; no pipeline coverage. Demand analysis: Full history (19 periods) shows variable demand with overall mean ~85 (basis for OR's 88 recommendation using promised L=0 and equal-weighted history). However, recent regime shift: last 5 periods (P15-19) avg 109 (55,133,95,95,166); last 4 (P16-19) avg 122 (133,95,95,166). Major stockouts: P16 (demand 133, sold 81, lost 52), P19 (166 vs 95, lost 71). Earlier periods stable ~80 but recent highs sustained over 4+ periods indicate upward shift, likely warranting higher forecast than OR's historical mean. No calendar dates for seasonality, product 'chips(Regular)' steady but reacting to recent patterns. OR limitations: No recency weighting, ignores recent surge/stockouts. Strategy: Since L=0, this is single-period newsvendor (cu=1 profit lost, co=1 holding); optimal Q = median demand ~95 (recent), but trending up + stockout costs over periods justify override to 120 (covers recent avg 122 + buffer for volatility/spikes >166 unlikely but hedge total reward).
