Recent (P44-48): avg 110.6. (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 48 concluded periods (every order arrives same period); no in-transit or overdue/missing orders. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; entering P49 empty after P48 stockout (115 ordered vs 124 demand). Pipeline empty. (e) With lead time 0, order arrives before P49 demand; near-endgame (P49/50), newsvendor critical fractile 0.5 suggests median ~115, but upside variance and carry to P50 (reduces effective overage) justify safety buffer; order 130 to target full service on ~110-120 expected demand while limiting excess holding.",
