Forecast for P47: 100 \xb120. (c) Lead time: consistently 0 periods across all 46 concluded periods (every order arrives same period, e.g., P46: ordered P46 arrived P46); no in-transit or overdue/missing orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 34 (low, covers ~1/3 expected demand); in-transit 0; no pipeline fill needed. (e) Final order logic: target coverage for E[D]=100 + safety stock ~25 (for variance/sd~15, 95% service) - on-hand 34 = 91; round to 90 for balance vs holding (near endgame P47/50, excess ends up held 1-3 periods at $1/unit but stockout loses $4 profit; order 90 \u2192 expected start 124, sell 100, end ~24).",
