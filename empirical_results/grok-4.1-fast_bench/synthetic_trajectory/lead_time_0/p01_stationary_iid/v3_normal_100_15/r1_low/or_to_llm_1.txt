Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All 49 concluded periods show 'lead_time was 0 periods' for orders placed in the same period (e.g., P49 order arrived in P49), confirming actual lead time matches promised 0 consistently; no lost shipments as all orders conclude promptly. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no pipeline coverage; must order to cover Period 50 demand only (post-arrival). Demand analysis: Historical demands fluctuate 60-134 but center ~100 (recent 10 periods P40-49 avg=94.9, full avg~100); no sustained regime shift (variations i.i.d.-like), no calendar/seasonal info for chips(Regular). OR recommendation: 101 units, using full history, L=0, base-stock policy balancing profit/holding (q=0.5); aligns with recent demands (e.g., P49 demand=112>101 stockout, P48=105>101 start). Strategy: Follow OR exactly as reality matches its assumptions (stable demand, L=0, no anomalies); order 101 to target base-stock ~expected demand, minimizing holding while avoiding frequent stockouts.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 101 units - demand stable around 100 (recent avg 95), lead time confirmed 0 periods across all history, no pipeline or anomalies.",
