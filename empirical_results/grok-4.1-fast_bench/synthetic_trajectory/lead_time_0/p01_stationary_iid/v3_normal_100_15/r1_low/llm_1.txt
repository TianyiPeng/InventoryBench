(c) Lead time confirmed 0 periods consistently (all 48 concludes show 'lead_time was 0 periods'); no in-transit or overdue/missing orders. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; starting P49 with nothing, order arrives same period before demand. (e) Forecast D49~100 based on recent/overall mean; order 100 to match expected demand for P49 (profit=holding=1 implies neutral carry-over, but period-specific matching optimal; covers demand while minimizing expected ending inventory cost, buffer for P50 handled in next decision).",

{
  "rationale": "(a) chips(Regular) is a standard snack product with steady, non-seasonal demand; no calendar dates provided beyond period numbers, so no major events or seasonality to anchor (e.g., no holidays, back-to-school). (b) Demand stable regime around 90-110 units/period historically (full avg ~98); recent 10 periods (P40-49) avg 95, last 5 (P45-49) avg 100 with some upside (102,105,112); no sustained shift (fluctuations consistent, no 3+ period mean/variance jump). (c) Lead time confirmed 0 periods consistently across all 49 periods (every order arrives same period as placed, e.g., P49 order arrived P49); no in-transit or lost orders. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; pipeline empty, no expected arrivals beyond this period's order. (e) With lead time 0, order covers P50 demand directly; target ~100 recent avg + buffer for variance (up to ~120 max observed recently) while minimizing holding (profit=holding=$1); order 110 balances stockout risk vs. overstock.",
