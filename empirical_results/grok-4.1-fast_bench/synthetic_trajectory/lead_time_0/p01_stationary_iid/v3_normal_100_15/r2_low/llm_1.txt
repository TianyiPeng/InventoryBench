(d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no pipeline or overdue shipments; starting from scratch for P49. (e) Lead time=0 means order arrives before P49 demand; symmetric costs (profit=$1/sold, holding=$1/ending) favor ordering at expected demand ~100; order 110 to buffer volatility/endgame sales opportunity (recent highs, only P50 left, minimizes stockout risk vs. limited holding exposure).",

(c) Lead time consistently 0 periods (all 49 concludes confirm same-period arrival, e.g., P49 order arrived P49); no in-transit or overdue/missing orders. (d) On-hand=32, in-transit=0; post-order start inv=32+Q. (e) Last period (50/50): newsvendor optimal with p=1/h=1 targets median~mean demand 99 (cu/co=0.5); Q=68 yields ~100 total inv.
