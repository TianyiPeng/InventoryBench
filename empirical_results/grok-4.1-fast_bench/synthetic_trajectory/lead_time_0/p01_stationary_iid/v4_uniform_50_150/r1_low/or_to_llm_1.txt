{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All 49 concluded periods show actual lead_time=0 periods (e.g., Period 49: arrived=84 (ordered on Period 49, lead_time was 0)), matching promised LT=0; no lost shipments or delays observed. Inventory: On-hand=16, in-transit=0; total pipeline=16. Demand analysis: Historical demands fluctuate 53-147 (full mean ~105, recent 5 periods P45-49 avg=87.4 (98,109,53,84,93)); no sustained regime shift or seasonality (no calendar dates provided, chips(Regular) shows no obvious patterns). OR recommendation: 93 units, likely targeting base_stock ~109 (16+93) based on historical mu~105, sigma, L=0; cap not binding. Strategy: Follow OR as it aligns with stable demand outlook, confirmed LT=0, and low on-hand; order 93 to cover expected demand ~90-110, minimizing stockout/hold risk (q=0.5). No overrides needed.",
