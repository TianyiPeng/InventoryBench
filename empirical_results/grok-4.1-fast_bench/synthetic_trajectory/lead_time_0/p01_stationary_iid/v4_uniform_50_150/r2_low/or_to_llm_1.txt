Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All concluded periods (1-49) consistently show 'lead_time was 0 periods' (e.g., P49: ordered on 49, arrived 49), matching promised L=0; no lost shipments or delays observed. Inventory analysis: On-hand=2 (very low from P49 ending), in-transit=0; will arrive after order but before demand in P50. Demand analysis: Historical demands fluctuate 50-150 (full mean ~92 from OR stats implied), recent 5 periods (P45-49: 123,64,51,107,91; avg=87) align with long-term ~90-100; no regime shift or seasonality (no dates/events). OR recommendation: 91 units (base-stock for L=0, using all history); appropriate as it targets coverage for expected demand ~91 + safety, avoiding stockout (common in history) while minimizing holding (profit=holding=1, critical fractile=0.5). Strategy: Follow OR exactly; order 91 to build to ~93 starting inventory (2+91), sufficient for typical demand without excess holding risk.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 91 units - matches historical mean demand ~90-100, recent avg 87, confirmed L=0, and low on-hand (2) needs replenishment to avoid stockout.",
