Current inventory: on-hand=150 (from P48 ending), no pipeline.

P48: started 1193, demand=1043, sold=1043, end=150 - covered but low buffer. OR rec=462 severely underestimates due to averaging full history (early ~100 drags mean down); ignores regime shift. Strategy: Override upward aggressively for lead=0 (order covers P49 demand directly). Expected P49 demand ~1050-1100+ (trend + volatility), target starting inv~1300 (150+1150) for safety stock (critical q=4/5=0.8, z~0.84; recent sd~60 \u2192 safety~50; mu~1000+trend adj \u2192 base~1100 + buffer for escalation).

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All 49 concluded periods show consistent 'lead_time was 0 periods' with immediate arrivals matching orders placed that period; no lost shipments or delays observed, confirming actual lead time = promised 0. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=203, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Demand analysis: Sustained massive escalation per carry-over insights; recent P46-49 demands=968,957,1043,1097 (avg 1016, up from P44-48 avg 950 per prior insight); P49=1097 confirms continued upward volatile trend with no decline, frequent near-stockouts despite ramping orders 950+. Full history skewed low early (P1-9 avg~118), but regime shift dominant since P10+ now averaging 600-900+ recently. OR recommendation=434 severely underestimates due to equal-weighting all history and ignoring recency/escalation; its base-stock likely ~\u03bc\u0302(1+0)= historical mean ~400ish. Strategy: Override OR heavily; with L=0, target base-stock = recent mean 1016 + safety for \u03c3~100+ volatility and upward trend \u2192 aim ~1400 coverage. Current on-hand 203 + order=1403 \u2192 order 1200 to cover expected ~1100+ demand this period, minimizing stockout risk (profit $4 vs holding $1 favors stocking up) while avoiding excess hold if slight dip.",
