Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All historical concludes (P1-P49) confirm actual lead_time=0 periods consistently (e.g., P49 order arrived in P49), matching promised L=0; no lost shipments or delays observed (in-transit=0). Inventory position: On-hand=15 (very low, post-P49 stock near-out with demand=1104 > ordered 1100), pipeline=0; total coverage critically low for Period 50 demand. Demand analysis: Sustained acceleration per carry-over (P45-P48 avg=968; now P46-P49 avg=1014 with P49=1104 peak, +4.7% increase); extrapolating trend (+50-70 recent increments) forecasts P50 ~1150-1200+ mean, high volatility (std dev ~50+), frequent stockouts. No calendar/product seasonality cues, but trend overrides early low demands (P1-P5 avg~97). OR recommendation: 616 units - severely underestimated due to full-history mean (diluted by early lows), ignores regime shift; its base-stock likely ~616 for 1+L=1 period. Strategy: Override OR upward to 1200 = recent avg 1014 + trend uplift 100 + safety ~100 (z~1.6 for 95% service on vol~60); ensures starting inv~1215 covers expected demand + buffer vs holding cost (q=0.8), prioritizing profit from sales over low holding risk.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Greatly increased OR's 616 to 1200 units - demand accelerating (P46-P49 avg 1014, P49=1104 peak vs prior 968 avg +5%), OR outdated on trend; order covers extrapolated ~1180 demand + safety to prevent stockouts.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand acceleration extended P46-P49: avg 1014 vs P45-P48 avg 968 (+5%), with P49=1104 peak confirming sustained upward trend and volatility",
