Inventory analysis: On-hand=200, in-transit=0; order placed now arrives during P49 (visible in P50 conclude), so effective starting inventory for P49 demand=200 + order_qty. Demand analysis: Extreme surge sustained and intensifying per carry-over (e.g., P44-47 avg=926); P48 demand=1043 (new record, +8.7% over P47=957); P44-48 avg=949 (+2.6% over P44-47); 5 consecutive >=873 with upward trend (873\u2192907\u2192968\u2192957\u21921043, recent sd~65 but peaks rising); early history irrelevant (P1-9 avg~118). No calendar/product seasonality cues. OR recommendation: 630 units - severely underestimates due to equal-weighting full history (dilutes recent surge); its base-stock/cap ignores regime shift. Strategy: Override upwards to 1150 - targets base-stock ~1100+ (recent demand avg + safety for variance/uptrend + buffer to end ~200-300 vs holding cost $1<<$19 profit); aligns with recent successful orders (P47/P48=1100 covered 957/1043 with ending 143/200); avoids stockout risk (4/5 recent periods had potential shortfalls without buffer).",

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All historical conclude messages (P1-P49) confirm actual lead_time=0 periods consistently (e.g., P49: arrived=1150 units ordered on Period 49, lead_time was 0), no lost shipments or delays; promised=0 matches reality. Inventory status: On-hand=253, in-transit=0; total pipeline covers nothing beyond current on-hand. Demand analysis: Extreme ongoing surge per carry-over insights (e.g., P44-48 avg949, P49=1097 new high); recent P46-49 demands=968/957/1043/1097 (avg=1016, +7% over P44-48 avg949, all >=957 with upward trend); no calendar/dates provided, but trend demands 1100+ coverage for P50 to avoid stockout (recent 4/5 stockouts when underordering). OR recommendation=614 is severely lagged (uses full history including early ~100 avg, ignores recent surge); uncapped base-stock likely low due to outdated mu_hat/sigma_hat. Strategy: Override OR upwards to target base-stock ~1250 (recent avg1016 + safety for +10% trend/upside/volatility, critical fractile q=19/20=0.95 implies high z*~1.645); with L=0, order=1100 ensures 253+1100=1353 covers expected 1100-1200+ (mirrors successful P47-49 orders of 1100-1150 which built ending inv 143-253 after high demands).
