  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All concluded periods (P1-P49) show consistent 'lead_time was 0 periods' for every arrived order; no lost shipments or delays observed, confirming actual LT=0 (same-period arrival). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=220, in-transit=0; total available before P50 order=220. After ordering Q (arrives before demand), available=220+Q. Demand analysis: Sustained high-volatility regime P26-48 (mean~198, std~150 per carry-over); P49=0 fits pattern of extreme lows (e.g., P47=0, P46=22, P43=17); recent P40-49 (10 periods): mean=163, median~148 (sorted: 0,0,17,22,132,164,213,292,296,298), with spikes >220 in 30% cases but frequent lows. No calendar dates or product seasonality cues. With profit=holding=1, critical fractile q=0.5 implies target available~median demand (~148-200); current 220 already exceeds this, so optimal Q=0 to avoid excess holding (P(D>220)~30% recent, but service >50% and symmetric costs favor not overstocking further). OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock - pipeline <0, capped at 0); aligns perfectly with analysis as OR uses full-history mean (likely ~140-150) and sees high inventory. Strategy: Follow OR exactly; 220 covers expected P50 demand with buffer for volatility, expect end-inv ~20-220 holding trade-off optimal. No new sustained patterns (P49 low reinforces volatility, not shift).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - on-hand 220 exceeds recent median demand (~148 from P40-49) and regime mean (~163-200), optimal given LT=0 and symmetric profit/holding costs in high-volatility environment.",
