Full recent avg P44-P48=4509. OR baseline uses all history (\u03bc\u0304 high due to growth, \u03c3\u0304 accounts for variance), recommends 4592 under capped base-stock (L=0 promised=actual). No calendar/product seasonality signals (generic 'Period_49', chips steady demand).

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods across all 49 concluded periods (every order placed in N arrived in N, e.g., P49 order arrived P49). No lost shipments or delays observed. Current inventory position: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so pipeline empty; order for P50 will arrive during P50 before demand. Demand analysis: Long-term upward trend per carry-overs, with recent stabilization P44-P47 avg=4432 (low variance), but P48=4822 (+9% vs prior avg), P49=5048 (+5% from P48, sold limited to 4592 causing stockout) signal renewed acceleration (P48-P49 avg=4935, +11% vs P44-P47). Full recent P43-P49 avg=4521, but last 3 P47-P49 avg=4779 trending up. No calendar dates or product seasonality cues (regular chips, periods only). OR recommendation: 4706 units, using promised L=0 and equal-weighted historical mean/std (diluted by early low demands ~100-4000); critical fractile q=19/20=0.95 implies high service. Strategy: Override OR upward to 5100 - targets recent trend-adjusted E[D] ~5000 + safety buffer (z~1.645*recent sigma~100 for 95% coverage), prioritizing avoiding stockout (profit $19>>holding $1); overstock risk low.
