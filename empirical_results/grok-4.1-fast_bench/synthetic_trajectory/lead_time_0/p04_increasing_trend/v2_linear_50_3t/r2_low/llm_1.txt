Overall forecast ~185-200 for P46 given trend. (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 45 concluded periods (every arrival matches 'ordered on Period X, lead_time was 0'); no in-transit or overdue orders. (d) On-hand=2, in-transit=0; low stock entering P46, no pipeline cover. (e) Order 200: covers expected ~190 demand + buffer for upside variance/trend (recent highs 193-201, frequent stockouts), balances lost sales vs holding since profit=holding=1; conservative high for near-end periods (5 left).",
