Inventory: On-hand=0, pipeline=0, so Period 50 starting inventory will equal our order (arrives same period). Demand analysis: Carry-over confirms regime shift lower since P21 (P21-P40 avg 72.6 vs early ~94). Recent P40-P49 demands: 72,81,31,67,74,32,79,77,48,83 (mean=64.4, median~73, high volatility with lows ~30s, highs ~80s). Full historical mean ~80 pulls OR to 83 (likely mu_bar + safety/capped). No calendar/seasonality (generic Period_50). OR limitations: Uses promised L=0 (correct) but full history without recency/regime weighting. Strategy: Override OR down due to sustained lower regime (29 periods P21+ avg ~70); order 75 targets recent median/mean blend + modest safety (q=0.5 indifferent, but volatility warrants ~73 + buffer) to balance stockout risk (e.g., P49 lost 11 sales) vs holding; covers expected ~70-80 demand.",
