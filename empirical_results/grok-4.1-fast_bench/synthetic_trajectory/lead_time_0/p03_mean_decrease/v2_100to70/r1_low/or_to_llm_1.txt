OR rec=81 aligns with base-stock for L=0 (\u03bc\u0302=\u03bc\u0304, safety via fractile q=0.5 z\u22480 + cap); since LT matches OR assumption, stable demand, and near end (49/50) with holding=profit=1 (low overstock penalty but stockout loses sale), follow OR precisely - covers expected demand + modest safety without excess holdover to Period 50.
