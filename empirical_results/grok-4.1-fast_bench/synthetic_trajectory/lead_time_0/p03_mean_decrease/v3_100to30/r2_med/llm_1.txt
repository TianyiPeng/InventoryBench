{
  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates or detailed product description provided; regular chips typically have steady snack demand but show strong cyclic pattern overriding seasonality. (b) Demand regime: Confirmed cyclic LHH since P41 (9 periods): lows ~3-13 (avg~8), highs ~40-53 (avg~46.6); P49=13 (low), so P50 expected high ~47. Historical avg prior ~80-90 dropped long ago. (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 49 periods (every order arrives same period, no lost shipments). (d) On-hand=36, in-transit=0, no pipeline/overdues; post-P49 ending=36 covers ~3/4 of expected P50 high demand, risks stockout of ~11 units. (e) Order 20 to target total starting inv=56 (covers avg high 47 + safety ~10 for variance/std~6, minimizes stockout loss $4/unit vs hold $1/unit; aligns with prior high-period coverage).",
