{
  "rationale": "(a) No specific calendar dates or world events provided beyond period numbers; regular chips are a staple snack with steady baseline demand but subject to unexplained regime shifts in history. No seasonal drivers identifiable. (b) Demand regime analysis: P44-48 demands=55,37,78,83,43 (avg=59, median=55, std~20.6); slight down from P40-43 avg=70 (-16%) but high volatility with spikes prevents confirming new sustained regime. Ongoing low regime per carry-over (~60-70 mean, volatile); forecast P49 ~65 mean/60 median. (c) Lead_time vs. missing orders: Consistently 0 periods confirmed in all 48 'conclude' messages (e.g., P48: arrived=80 ordered on P48, lead_time=0); no in-transit, no overdue/lost shipments. (d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=37, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected this period beyond new order. Covers ~half of expected demand; ample for low scenario but risks stockout on high. (e) Final order logic: Newsvendor optimal (Cu=1 profit lost, Co=1 holding, fractile=0.5) targets available=median demand ~60; order=60-37=23. Adjust slightly up to 30 for discrete units, right-skew/volatility buffer, and minimal ending carry to P50 (marginal value~0).",
