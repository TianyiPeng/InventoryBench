(c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 44 concludes (every order arrives same period); no in-transit or lost orders. (d) Inventory: on-hand=54, in-transit=0; low buffer risks stockout if demand>54 (e.g., P44=65 already close). (e) With LT=0, order covers P45 demand (~110 expected + safety for volatility/upside); total avail=54+Q; target Q=120 for ~174 avail (sell~110, end~64); high profit($19) vs holding($1) justifies buffer near end (P45-50); avoids stockouts seen in low-inventory periods.",
