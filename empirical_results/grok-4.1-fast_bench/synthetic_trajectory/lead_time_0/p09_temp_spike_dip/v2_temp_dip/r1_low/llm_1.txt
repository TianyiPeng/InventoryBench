Forecast P46 ~110 (bias up post-P45 stockout and cycle pattern). (c) Lead-time vs missing orders: Confirmed 0 periods consistently across all 45 concludes (e.g., P45 order arrived P45); no in-transit or lost orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending; P45 ended at 0 after partial stockout (sold=80<130). (e) Final order logic: Lead=0 means order arrives before P46 demand; order expected demand ~110 with safety for volatility/post-spike upside (historical cycle suggests high regime continuation); balances stockout risk (lost profit) vs holding (equal cost) for remaining 5 periods.",
