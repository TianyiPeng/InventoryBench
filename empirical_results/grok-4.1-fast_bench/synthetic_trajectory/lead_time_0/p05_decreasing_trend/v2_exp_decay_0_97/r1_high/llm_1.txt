(c) Lead time confirmed 0 periods consistently (all 46 concludes show 'lead_time was 0 periods'); no in-transit or missing orders. (d) On-hand 68 (covers multiple periods at ~25/period), in-transit 0; ample buffer vs expected. (e) Order 25 to target post-period on-hand ~68 (68+25-25), replenishing expected demand while minimizing excess holding given decline trend, low stockout risk (recent max 45<68+order), and 4 periods remaining (cumulative ~100 demand feasible with reactive ordering).",
