(b) Demand in sustained low regime per carry-over: recent P41-47 avg 63 (58,63,61,79,55,48,79); P38-47 10-period avg 62 confirms stability around 60-70, no new regime shift. (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 47 concludes (e.g., P47: ordered P47 arrived P47); no missing orders or drifts. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no pipeline, clean slate for P48. (e) With lead=0, order arrives before demand; near end (P48/50), target recent avg ~65 with minor safety vs stockouts (recent 79s); order 70 balances sales vs holding (profit=holding=$1), avoids excess for final periods.",

(c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 48 concluded periods (every order arrives same period); no in-transit or lost orders.
