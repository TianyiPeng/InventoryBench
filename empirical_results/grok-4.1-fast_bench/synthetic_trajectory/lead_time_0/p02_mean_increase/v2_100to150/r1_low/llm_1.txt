  "rationale": "(a) chips(Regular): standard snack chips, no product-specific seasonality; no calendar dates provided, so no event/seasonal drivers. (b) Demand regime: sustained high demand since P16 (carry-over avg172 P16-18, recent P38-47 avg165 (143,156,173,176,197,169,133,185,135,181), last5 P43-47 avg161 (169,133,185,135,181)); variable 130-200 but mean ~165, no new regime shift. (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 47 concluded periods (every arrival matches order in same period, no in-transit or losses). (d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; no expected arrivals beyond this period's order; P47 ended at 0 after stockout-ish (sold170/181). (e) Final order logic: with lead=0, order covers P48 demand forecast ~165-170; near endgame (3 periods left), balance stockout loss ($1 profit) vs holding ($1/period); myopic newsvendor (cu=co=1) suggests median ~165; order 170 to match recent highs/post-stockout pattern (e.g., P46:170, P43:185) while minimizing multi-period hold risk.",
