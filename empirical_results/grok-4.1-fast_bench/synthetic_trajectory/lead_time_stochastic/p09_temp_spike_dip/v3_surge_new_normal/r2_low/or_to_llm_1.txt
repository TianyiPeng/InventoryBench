Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variability (1-3 periods recently, e.g., P40 LT=3 P43, P41 LT=3 P44, P42 LT=3 P45); severe loss pattern with no arrivals P46-P49 (4 straight periods per P49 conclude), extending prior streaks, many prior orders confirmed lost (e.g., P44:200 lost by P48). In-transit 2052 likely includes heavy losses, effective live pipeline low/uncertain despite total. Inventory: On-hand 8 (low, covers <1 period demand); massive in-transit risks either flood (high holding) or more losses (stockouts). Demand analysis: Low regime sustained P26-49 avg ~122 (19+ periods, recent P46-49: 106,151,126,117 avg 125, consistent no shift); chips(Regular) no calendar/seasonal cues in Period_50. OR rec: 0 units (base-stock - pipeline <0, capped); aligns with low demand + huge/risky pipeline. Strategy: Follow OR 0 to avoid adding to lost pile/holding risk; on-hand 8 + any surviving pipeline covers expected ~120 demand; monitor for arrivals in future concludes before increasing.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - low demand regime sustained at ~122 avg (P26-49), on-hand 8 + massive 2052 in-transit (despite high loss risk) covers near-term needs without adding to potential holding costs or lost orders.",
