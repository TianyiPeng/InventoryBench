No arrivals in P45-48 concludes. In-transit 1544 likely includes pending odd orders + accumulating lost evens. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout in P48 on 67 demand); massive pipeline 1544 dwarfs expected 2-period demand (~90*2=180, even assuming 50% losses). Demand analysis: Low regime sustained P26-48 (~20 periods, recent P44-48 avg=86 vs prior low ~110); varying but consistently below historical ~105 avg P1-25. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock policy sees sufficient pipeline vs low mu_hat over L=2). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - no need to order with high pipeline covering residual game (P49-50 demands); new P49 order (odd-period) risks loss/delay beyond game end (arrives P50+ after LT>=1, no sales contribution, potential post-game holding irrelevant). Avoids exacerbating pipeline bloat.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Even-period orders consistently lost (sustained pattern: P44(300) absent through P49, >5 periods past promised L=2; prior evens like P6,P2 etc.); odd-periods variable L=1-3 with some losses (e.g., P25,19 lost) but recent successes (P41 L=3 arrived P44, P35 L=2, P31 L=1). No arrivals since P44 (from P41 odd), confirming no imminent pipeline from recent orders (P42-49 mostly 0 orders, P44 even lost). In-transit 1544 bloated with accumulated lost shipments (no holding cost on in-transit). Inventory: On-hand 0, vulnerable to stockout P50 demand ~100 (low regime P26-49 avg ~98, P46-49 unmet demands 126,82,67,110 indicate ~96 avg). Demand analysis: Low regime sustained 24 periods P26-49 (~98 avg), recent P46-49 ~96; P49=110 within variation, no regime shift (vs prior high P16-25 ~215). No calendar/product seasonality signals (generic periods/chips). OR rec: 0 (base-stock low due to bloated pipeline + all-history mean ~110, L=2 promised; cap irrelevant). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - P50 even order would likely lost (no benefit, just bloats in-transit); endure one stockout (~$400 lost profit) to order reliably on P51 odd (~100-150 for 3-period cover L+1). Covers expected low demand without excess holding risk.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - P50 even-period order likely lost per sustained pattern (e.g., P44 absent >5 periods); bloated in-transit 1544 ineffective (lost shipments), no reliable arrivals imminent; defer to P51 odd for effective replenishment amid low demand ~100/period.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Even-period losses further sustained: P44(300) absent through P49 (>L=5 past promised 2); Demand low regime extended P26-49 avg ~98 (24 periods, recent P46-49 ~96).",
