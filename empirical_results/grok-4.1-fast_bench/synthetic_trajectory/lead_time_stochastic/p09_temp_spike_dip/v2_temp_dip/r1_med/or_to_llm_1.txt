Expected P49 arrivals: possibly P48's 150u if LT=1 (precedents like P31\u219232, P32\u219233, P39\u219240), but conservative assumption low probability given recent 2-3 trend (P40\u219243 LT3, P41\u219244 LT3, P42\u219245 LT3, P43\u219245 LT2). No arrivals from P46/P47 (ordered 0). Inventory analysis: On-hand 48 low, will likely sell out in P49 (demand ~100, stockout ~50 expected). Actual pipeline minimal (~150u P48 pending at best; cumulative lost ~1867u inflates in-transit to 1867u, per carry-over). Demand analysis: Recent P45-48: 130/97/122/80 avg 107; broader P26-48 high regime ~105 avg sustained (despite brief P41-44 softening to 74 and P48 dip to 80, not sustained 3+ periods). Initial samples P1-5 avg ~100 align with long-term. No calendar/dates for seasonality. OR recommendation: 0 units - follows base-stock but overestimates pipeline (ignores losses, assumes promised L=2 and full history \u03bc\u0304~95, \u03bc\u0302~285 for L=2, but pipeline 1915 >> base_stock ~300-350). Adjustment strategy: Override to 150u (recent order size matching demand mean+10% buffer). Provides coverage for (L+1)=3-4 periods (~330-440u needed), current actual coverage ~48+150=198 insufficient. Matches critical fractile q=4/5=0.8 (z~0.84, safety ~20-30u/period).
