Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows high variability (1-3 typical, with long delays/loss suspicions overturned by sustained high in-transit); recent no arrivals P46-P49, but carry-over confirms delayed arrivals over losses (e.g., prior 'lost' like P33 pending, in-transit robust). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 after recent stockouts (P48-P49 demands 81+91 unmet), but in-transit=1371 covers ~14 periods at recent avg demand 98 (P46-49:119,101,81,91) or 12+ at high regime 110 (P39-45). No overdue signals for new losses; prior patterns (sporadic delays) sustained. Demand analysis: No calendar/product seasonality cues; historical initial ~100, low regime P16-23 ~50 overturned, high P39-45 ~110, recent P46-49 stabilizing ~98 (+/-10% volatility, no new regime shift). OR recommendation: 0 units (capped base-stock, using promised LT=2 and full history mean/var; assumes i.i.d., ignores delays/losses). Strategy: Follow OR=0 - pipeline massively over-covers expected demand over multiple LT horizons (even if LT=3-5), ordering adds holding cost risk without stockout threat; conserves cash, avoids exacerbating backlog. Future: Monitor P50 conclude (P48 order LT) for arrival patterns.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - 1371 in-transit covers 14+ periods of recent ~98 demand/period despite current on-hand 0 and stockouts; aligns with delayed-but-robust supply pattern.",
