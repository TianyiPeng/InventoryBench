Steady baseline demand expected ~80-100 absent shifts, but history shows volatility. (b) Demand regime: Sustained low regime P16-P25 avg~50 (per carry-over, -50% vs hist ~100), extended but interrupted by P25=0 (anomalous low) and P26=114 (high, matching early hist). Last 10 periods (P17-P26) avg 57 (sd~32, volatile: 0-114); not yet sustained shift back to high (only 1 high period). Forecast P27 ~60 (recent avg, conservative bias to low regime). (c) Lead-time vs missing orders: LT variable (1-3 observed); recent reliable LT=1-2 for P21-23 (arr P23/P25). Many losses confirmed (e.g., P19/P17/P15/P6/P2, cumul ~500+ units per insights); P26 conclude arrived=0 (expected: recent P24-26 orders=0). No new losses confirmed. Promised LT=2, but assume 1-3; losses deflate effective pipeline. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=61 (covers ~1 period at 60 demand); in-transit=540 nominal but heavily inflated by losses (~500+ lost historicially), effective pipeline low (~40?). Recent arrivals sparse (P26=0, P25=100 from P23); recent orders P24-26=0 => low expected arr P27-P28 (P24 LT3/P25 LT2/P26 LT1 all 0). Risk stockout P28+ if no older arrivals. (e) Final order logic: Forecast 60/period x (LT+1=3-4 periods coverage) =180-240 needed ahead, but low effective pipeline + stockout risk (lost profit $19>>hold $1) => order 100 to replenish buffer/safety for P28-P30+ (matches hist order size, covers volatility to 114).
