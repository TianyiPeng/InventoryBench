{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Predominant LT=3 periods sustained (recent confirms: P40\u2192P43 LT=3, P41\u2192P44 LT=3, P42\u2192P45 LT=3), with variability (LT=1/2 observed sporadically); many historical losses confirmed (e.g., P37/P33/P30 etc., dead pipeline ~3446+ entering recent periods, now reflected in 2646 in-transit with no recent arrivals P46-P49 despite expectations). Inventory analysis: On-hand=807 covers ~4 periods at high regime avg 200+ demand; in-transit=2646 likely includes delayed/lost but still ample coverage even if 50% lost (effective pipeline >> review+LT demand). Demand analysis: High regime P23-P49 avg ~210 sustained (P33-P49 subset ~217), volatile spikes (298 P48, 0 P49/47); no calendar/product seasonality to anchor shifts; recent lows (P46=22,P47=0,P49=0) not sustained (only 3/27 periods <50 since P23). OR recommendation: 0 units (appropriate given promised LT=2/historical mean, but we confirm with actual LT=3+high inv). Strategy: Follow OR at 0 - excess inventory risks high holding costs ($1/unit/period) vs $19 profit; no need to order as on-hand + expected arrivals (even partial) cover 10+ periods; monitor for sustained demand drop but current evidence insufficient.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR's 0 units - high on-hand (807) + in-transit (2646) covers high demand regime (~210 avg) for 10+ periods at LT=3; ordering more risks holding costs amid lost shipment pattern.",
