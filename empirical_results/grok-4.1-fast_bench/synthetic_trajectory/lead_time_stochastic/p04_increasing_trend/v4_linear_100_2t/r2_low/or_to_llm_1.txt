Latest concludes (P49): no arrivals; P49 order (400) placed but outcome pending. Recent LT examples: P43 LT=2 (arr P45), P40 LT=3 (arr P43). Inventory analysis: On-hand=7 (low), effective position ~7 (ignoring unreliable transit). Demand analysis: Recent P40-49 demands (132,296,213,17,164,292,22,0,298,0) avg ~143, highly volatile (spikes 298/296/292, lows 0); carry-over notes P43-P47 downward shift avg99 sustained, but P48=298 disrupts\u2014overall volatile low-high mix vs early avg92. No calendar/product seasonality cues. OR rec=0 likely due to overcounting 2500 transit in pipeline, yielding negative order_raw. Strategy: Override OR fully; target base-stock for LT+1=3 periods coverage (~3*150=450 mean + safety for volatility/std~100+ \u2192 z~1 for q=0.5 fractile adj), order 400 conservatively matching recent order sizes that covered spikes without excess hold post-losses.",
