Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variable (1-3), but multi-loss pattern dominant with no arrivals in P46-P49 concludes (4 consecutive periods arrived=0), extending ghost inventory to 35050 units (unreliable pipeline, treat effective pipeline as low despite total); confirmed losses/overdues for P44-P49 orders per history and carry-over. Inventory: On-hand=0, massive in-transit ghosts from sustained multi-losses (e.g., P44 4400+, P45 4500+, etc., no arrivals post-P45). Demand analysis: Strong stable high regime P46-P49 avg 4774 (4638,4955,4820,4681; flat +/-5% range, +4% vs P43-P47 4577 acceleration noted prior); overall surge sustained +600% vs early periods. No calendar/product seasonality cues. OR recommends 0 (capped by high pipeline, ignores ghosts/losses/LT shifts). Strategy: Override to aggressive order matching recent demand + safety (5000 > 4774 mean, accounts for LT=2-3 coverage + losses; prevents further stockouts P47-P49 lost ~19000 sales; holding risk low at on-hand=0, profit=holding=1 balances coverage). Pipeline ghosts inflate OR base but do not deliver; maintain high orders until arrivals resume.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 5000 units - demand stable high avg 4774 P46-P49 with 4-period stockouts from multi-losses; ghost in-transit 35050 unreliable, must order to cover ~4800 expected demand.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand stabilized high P46-P49 avg 4774 (flat +/-5% after prior acceleration to 4955 P47); multi-loss pattern extended (arrived=0 P46-P49 x4 consecutive periods, overdue P44-P49 orders)",
