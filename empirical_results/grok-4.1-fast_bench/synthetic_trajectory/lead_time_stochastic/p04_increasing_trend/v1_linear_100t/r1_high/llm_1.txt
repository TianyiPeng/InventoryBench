Demand typically steady for vending, with potential spikes around casual snacking occasions (e.g., workdays, events), but no calendar dates or seasonal cues provided (only 'Period_1'). No major retail events identifiable. (b) Demand regime: No live demand data yet (Period 1 start). Rely on provided historical samples: P1:107, P2:252, P3:298, P4:376, P5:544 (avg=316, clear upward trend: +135% P1-P2, then +18-45%). Suggests ramping demand; forecast P1 ~150 (near hist P1, conservative), rising to ~300 by P3. (c) Lead time: Promised 2 periods. No 'conclude' messages yet (first period), so no actual inference possible. No orders to check for delays/losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 demand will stock out fully (post-decision). No pipeline coverage for P2-P3+. (e) Final order logic: Order for expected demand over lead time +1 periods (~P2-P4, total ~800 at avg 300/trend-adjusted), but conservative start to probe: 400 units (covers ~P3 demand 300 + safety 100). Low holding ($1) vs high profit ($19) favors overstock vs stockouts; adjust future based on actuals.",
