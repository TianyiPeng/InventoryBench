  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates or specific product description provided beyond 'chips(Regular)'; generic snack with no evident seasonal drivers, demand driven by ongoing acceleration pattern. (b) Demand regime analysis: Acceleration sustained and intensifying; P45-49 avg 995 (919/930/986/1036/1104), up +5% vs prior P44-48 avg 943; recent P47-49 avg 1042 (+24/unit avg increase); forecast P50 ~1170 (extrapolate +65 avg rise) with safety to 1200+. (c) Lead-time vs missing orders: Inconsistent LT 1-3 historically, recent reliable LT2-3 until P45 arrivals; now severely strained with no arrivals P46-49 (4 periods) despite multiple pending (e.g., P47 order LT1-3 expected P48-50, no P48-49); lost pattern worsened, P45(1000)/P46(1100)/P47(1200) overdue past LT2-3. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0 (4th straight stockout P46-49, lost ~1104 P49 sales); in-transit 10580 bloated w/ likely lost shipments (carry-over ~7960+ prior, now higher), unreliable near-term arrivals expected low/none. (e) Final order logic: Aggressive order 1500 covers forecast 1200 + 25% safety buffer for stockout risk & pipeline failure; continues upward trend (P49=1400) to rebuild vs holding cost ($1 low vs $19 profit); prioritizes sales over overstock risk given LT unreliability.",
