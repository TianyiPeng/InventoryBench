{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: From recent 'conclude' messages, LT=3 predominant in latest arrivals (P42->P45 LT3, P41->P44 LT3, P40->P43 LT3), consistent with Period 45 carry-over; no new arrivals in P46-P48 confirms delays common, some extreme (e.g., prior 'lost' recover late). Promised LT=2 unreliable. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, stockout P48 (demand=82 unsold); recent stockouts P47(69), P48(82), partial P46(87/11 unsold). In-transit=1564 severely distorted by accumulated 'lost'/delayed shipments (~1294 per carry-over, plus potential new overdues like P44 order 120 past LT=3, P45 300 overdue); effective arriving pipeline low (no arrivals P46-48 despite high total). Demand analysis: Recent 8 periods (P41-48) avg=90 (64,103,101,88,125,87,69,82); full history ~95-100, stable no regime shift. OR recommendation: 0 units - uses promised L=2, full historical demand, ignores losses/delays so assumes bloated pipeline covers base_stock (likely ~ (1+2)*95 + safety ~300+, pipeline >> that). Adjustment strategy: Override OR's 0 upwards to 150 - account for unreliable pipeline (effective coverage low despite 1564 total), cover ~1.5-2x recent demand for current + LT=3 buffer; conservative vs. full 4*90=360 to avoid over-holding if delays persist, but prevent continued stockouts (profit=holding=1, but sales lost forever). Matches recent order sizes that eventually arrived.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent predominant LT=3 confirmed (last arrivals P42->45 LT3, P41->44 LT3, P40->43 LT3; no arrivals in P46-49 concludes despite potential slots for earlier orders like P44 expected P47). P44 order (120 units placed P44) now 3+ periods overdue (no P47-49 arrivals, past LT=3), reinforcing extreme delay/lost pattern but not new sustained shift. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0; in-transit=1714 nominal, but carry-over lost total=1294 (up to P43), effective pipeline ~420 units; recent P46-49 full stockouts (demands 87+69+82+79=317 lost sales) despite pipeline indicate non-materializing shipments. Demand analysis: Recent 10 periods avg ~91 (64-125), stable around historical ~100; chips(Regular) no seasonality evident (no dates/product drivers). OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history mean/variance, overestimates pipeline reliability ignoring losses/delays. Strategy: Override to conservative 120 units to cover ~1-2 periods demand amid uncertainty; targets base-stock ~400 (100*4 for LT=3+1) minus effective pipeline ~420 (slightly over but buffer for losses); avoids large order given holding cost=profit, prioritizes avoiding further stockouts while awaiting delayed arrivals.",
