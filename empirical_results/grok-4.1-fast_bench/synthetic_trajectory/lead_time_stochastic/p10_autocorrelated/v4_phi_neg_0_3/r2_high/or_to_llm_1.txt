OR recommendation: 0 units (logical under promised L=2 and historical mean, as pipeline appears to cover base_stock= ~\u03bc\u0302(1+2)~300 + safety, but ignores losses/delays/blackouts reducing effective pipeline to near-zero recently). Strategy: Override OR's 0 with 120 units to sustain ordering cadence (matches recent demands/orders like P47-49=120), ensuring continued pipeline input despite unreliable throughput; high profit (19) vs low holding (1) justifies aggressive replenishment over risking more stockouts (e.g., 338 lost sales P47-49); conservatively sized to ~1 period demand, avoiding excessive bloat while probing for resumption.",
