{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent history and carry-over confirm LT stabilized at 3 periods (e.g., P40->P43 LT=3, P41->P44 LT=3, P42->P45 LT=3), with sustained supplier reliability (no confirmed losses 14+ periods through P46, extended further). However, P44 order (140 units) overdue (expected P47, absent P47-P48 concludes, now 2 periods past at P49 start). Pipeline shows 1214 in-transit (high, possibly including overdue/prior inflated by past losses but recent reliable). Inventory: On-hand=8 (critically low, recent demand P48=82 will likely stockout this period), but massive pipeline covers extensive horizon. Demand analysis: Recent P46-48 demands 87/69/82 (avg 79); P44-48 avg 90; full history volatile ~80-150 (long-term ~100). No calendar/dates for seasonality; chips(Regular) steady retail demand, no evident regime shift sustained. OR recommendation: 0 units (uses promised L=2, all history mean ~100, \u03bc\u0302~(1+2)*100=300, \u03c3\u0302~\u221a3*std~high cap, but pipeline >> base_stock so capped at 0). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - no override needed; 1214 in-transit covers 12+ periods at 100/demand or 15+ at recent 80/demand, even with LT=3 (covers 4 periods). Adding orders risks high holding ($1/unit/period) on already excessive pipeline if demand stays ~90 or drops; prioritize avoiding overstock vs minor current stockout (lost profit $4 but temporary). Expected: Arrivals soon from pending (e.g., P46=0 no, but earlier like P45=0, but bulk covers).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - in-transit pipeline of 1214 units massively exceeds expected demand over multiple lead+review periods (recent avg ~90/demand covers 13+ periods), avoiding excess holding costs despite low on-hand.",
  "carry_over_insight": "P44 order (140 units) overdue by 2 periods past LT=3 (absent P47-P48); potential new loss after 14+ period reliability streak. Recent demand softening P46-48 avg 79 vs P40-45 avg 110 (-28%, 3 periods).",

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: LT stabilized at 3 periods recently (confirmed P40->P43 LT=3, P41->P44 LT=3, P42->P45 LT=3; P43->P45 LT=2 outlier but pattern holds, no contradicting new arrives in P46-P49). P44 order (140 units, placed P44) expected P47 for LT=3, absent P47-P49 concludes (overdue 3 periods), confirms lost - first since long streak, adds to ghost inventory. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0; in-transit=1214 exactly matches prior lost sum 1074 (up to P29/P33) + P44 140, effective real pipeline=0 (no reliable pending arrivals imminent, recent P45-P49 orders=0 expected later). Demand analysis: Recent P46-P49 demands 87/69/82/79 avg=79 (sustained softening -28% vs P40-P45 avg~99 over 4 periods); full history volatile ~80-150 avg~100 but recent regime shift downward confirmed. OR recommendation=0 flawed: uses promised L=2 (underestimates review period to 3), all-history demand (ignores recent drop), treats full in-transit as reliable (ignores ghosts/losses). Final strategy: Override to order 100 units for base-stock ~79*(3+1)=316 minus cap/safety adjustment for softening/volatility; covers LT+1 periods conservatively without overstocking given holding cost and low recent demand.",
