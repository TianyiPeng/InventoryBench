  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised L=2, but history confirms frequent L=3 (e.g., recent P40 arr P43 L=3, P42 arr P45 L=3, P43 arr P45 L=2) with sustained lost/delayed shipments (carry-over: in-transit 2222 matches accumulated overdue orders like P2/6/15/17/24/29/30/33/etc., no arrivals in P46-47, pattern ongoing). Inventory analysis: On-hand=894 covers ~6+ periods at avg recent demand (~110, P41-47:147/160/141/118/124/113/53 avg94 but elevated prior); total pipeline 894+2222=3116 vastly exceeds remaining 3 periods (P48-50) even at peak 186 (894/186~4.8 periods alone). Demand analysis: Elevated regime P41-45 avg138 sustained per carry-over, but P46=113/P47=53 dip (-20%/-60% vs avg138) suggests possible normalization (similar to prior P27-30 dip); historical mean ~100, no calendar/product seasonality cues. OR recommendation: 0 units (appropriate given high pipeline, uses promised L=2/historical demand, but reality amplifies need via lost shipments).

Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 829 is very high (covers 8+ periods at ~100 avg demand), effective pipeline ~0 due to non-arriving in-transit. Demand analysis: Recent P46-48 avg ~77 low (113,53,65), but only 3 periods - not sustained (similar to past short dips); P41-45 elevated ~138 confirmed prior shift but now fluctuating back toward long-term ~100 avg (P1-48 overall); no calendar/product seasonality evident (generic periods, regular chips). OR rec: 0 units, using promised L=2 and full history - aligns well as it accounts for high current inventory but overlooks lost pipeline (still, irrelevant with high on-hand).
