(c) LT variable 1-3 sustained (recent confirms LT=2-3 dominant, LT=1 sporadic); loss pattern sustained (P44/45 confirmed lost at P49; no arrivals P46-P49 streak 4 periods; P47@120/P48@120 overdue past LT=2/LT=1 by P49 conclude - likely lost or LT>=3/>=2). Promised LT=2 unreliable. (d) On-hand=0 (recent stockouts P47-P49 lost ~266 sales); in-transit=2000 bloated by cumulative confirmed losses (~760+ prior, now more); pipeline unreliable - possible P50 arrivals (P47 LT=3=120u, P48 LT=2=120u, P49 LT=1=110u) but low prob per pattern. Covers 0 reliable periods. (e) Forecast P50 demand ~110 (recent avg 108 + volatility buffer); order 120: covers current expected demand + safety stock for LT uncertainty/losses (1-3 periods), balances stockout risk (lost profit $1/u) vs holding $1/u/period; matches recent order sizing.",
