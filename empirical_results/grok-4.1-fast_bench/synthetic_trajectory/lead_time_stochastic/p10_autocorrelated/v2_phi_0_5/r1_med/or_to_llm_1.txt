{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: LT remains variable (1-3 periods confirmed recently, e.g., P42 LT=3 arr P45, P43 LT=2 arr P45, P40 LT=3 arr P43, P41 LT=3 arr P44); no new concludes in P46-48 (arrived=0), confirming P44 order (200, promised P46) overdue >3 periods past LT=2 (no arr by P48), P45 (200, promised P47) overdue >2 periods (no arr P47-48), P46 (150, promised P48) overdue 1 period past (no arr P48) - pattern of accumulating losses sustained, rendering in-transit 2386 mostly ghosts/unreliable. Inventory analysis: On-hand critically low at 29 (after P48 demand=128 sold all but 29 from prior); no imminent arrivals expected in P49 (recent 3 periods arrived=0, losses pattern); covers <1 period of demand. Demand analysis: Sustained high regime P37-48 avg ~127 (sum 1266/10 periods, excluding P47 anomaly 76; fits carry-over P37-46 avg134 + P48=128); historical baseline ~90 alternates with highs ~130-140, currently high. OR recommendation: 0 units - follows base-stock but over-relies on bloated illusory pipeline (ignores losses), using promised LT=2 and full history mean (diluted by baselines); ignores regime and losses. Strategy: Override OR with 200 units to cover ~1.5 periods high demand (130*1.5=195) over expected LT+1=4 periods uncertainty, matching recent successful order sizes (e.g., P39-P48 multiples of 150-200 replenished during highs); avoids stockouts in P49/P50 (low OH, no arrivals); minimizes holding risk near end-game as excess may not penalize post-P50. Total coverage: 29 OH + 200 order positions for ~230 demand before further arrivals/losses.",

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: LT remains variable (1-3 periods) with recent confirms (e.g., P42 LT=3 arr P45, P43 LT=2 arr P45, P40 LT=3 arr P43, P41 LT=3 arr P44 per history); many losses confirmed (e.g., P44, P45, P46 overdue/lost per carry-over up to P49), in-transit 2586 bloated with accumulated lost shipments (historical pattern: P2, P6, P17, P19, P25, P29, P30, P37, P44 etc.), effective pipeline ~0 as losses never arrive. Inventory: on-hand=0, will likely stockout P50 demand (~120-140) post-decision before any new arrivals. Demand analysis: High regime sustained P37-49 (13 periods avg ~124, e.g., P37-49 sum~1612/13=124, +41% vs baseline P34-36/21-24 avg~89); recent P46-49:140,76(dip),128,98 avg 111 but overall trend high, no sustained return to baseline. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock minus bloated pipeline <0, capped at 0; uses promised LT=2, full history mean~110 pulled down by early/stockouts, ignores losses/variability). Strategy: Override OR's 0 as ineffective pipeline ignored; order 200 to target coverage for 1-2 periods immediate demand + LT buffer (200/130~1.5 periods, conservative vs 3-4 period need due to loss risk/holding cost); aligns with recent successful orders (150-200), avoids adding to losses excessively while preventing prolonged stockouts.
