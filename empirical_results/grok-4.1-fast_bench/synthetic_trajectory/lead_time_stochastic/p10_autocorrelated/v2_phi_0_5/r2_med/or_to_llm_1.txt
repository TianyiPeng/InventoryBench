P48 conclude shows arrived=0, no new LT info; pending for P49 possible: P46 order 200 if LT=3, P47 150 if LT=2, P48 150 if LT=1.

Demand analysis: Recent upshift P45-48 demands 127,80,78,118 avg 100.75 (+266% vs P41-44 avg 27.5), sustained 4 periods confirming high regime ~100/period vs OR's full-history average (diluted by older lows ~85?).

Strategy adjustment: Override OR 0 to 150 - OH=0 risks stockout P49/P50 (~100 demand each, $400 profit lost); near game end (P50), P49 order arrives P50 if LT=1 (historical occurrences), covers expected demand with no downside (lost orders incur no holding); 150 aligns with recent demand avg, prior override levels (P46=200, P47/P48=150), balances potential overstock holding ($1/unit) if multiple arrivals.",
