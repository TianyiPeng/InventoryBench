{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: No new arrivals in Period 49 conclude (ordered=150 from P49, expected later); last arrivals in P45 (P42 LT=3), confirming recent LT~3 pattern but 5-period no-arrival streak (P46-P49) extends sustained supplier unreliability with legacy overdues (e.g., P15 LT>=34 per carry-over); in-transit 1733 unreliable, many likely lost despite total. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 risks immediate stockout; massive 1733 in-transit unreliable per history of lost/delayed (P2, P15, P17 etc.), recent stockouts (P49 sold=0 on 67 demand, P48 partial). Demand analysis: All-history mean ~105 (early stable ~110, P22-27 upturn ~155 sustained per carry-over but faded); recent P40-49 avg=100 (177,88,70,150,115,8,38,103,185,67 - volatile, highs 185/lows 8); no calendar/product seasonality signals. OR rec=0 valid under promised L=2/i.i.d. assumptions but ignores disruptions/unreliable pipeline; override to 150 units to cover ~1-2 periods expected demand (~100-150) post-stockouts, matching prior successful orders (e.g., P42=200 arr P45) while avoiding excess amid holding costs; ensures coverage for (actual LT~3 +1)=4 periods without over-relying on dubious pipeline.",

  "carry_over_insight": "No-arrival streak extended to P46-49 (4 periods) after P45 arrivals confirms sustained supplier unreliability; legacy disruptions persist (in-transit 1733 with overdues e.g. P15 LT>=34).",
