No orders placed in P44-P46 (all 0), so expected arrivals in P47-P49 ~0 (no recent orders matching LT=1-3).

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: LT remains variable (1-3 periods recently per carry-over, e.g., P43->P45 LT=2, P40->P43 LT=3); no new concluded arrivals in P48 (arrived=0, consistent with no major expected like P46 LT=2=0 units); high loss risk sustained (recent losses P29,P30,P33,P37, no arrivals P46-P48 reinforces). Expected P49 arrival: possibly P47's 200 (LT=2), but loss pattern suggests unreliable (~50% risk no-show). Inventory analysis: On-hand=52 critically low (covers <1 period at recent avg~100); in-transit=2004 massively bloated but largely lost shipments per carry-over (cumulative P2=144,P6=200,P15=200,P17=150,P19=110,P29=200,P30=200,P33=200,P37=200 + others ~2000+ total plausible), so actual pipeline unreliable/low despite total.
