Use mean 112 as forecast absent dates/seasons. (c) Lead-time vs. missing orders: Promised 2 periods; no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 start, no prior history), so no inference possible; assume promised until evidence. No in-transit to track. (d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1 demand unmet (post-decision); pipeline empty, so order builds coverage for Periods 3+ (lead time 2). (e) Final order logic: Order historical mean (112) to initiate pipeline for steady-state coverage (order ~expected demand/period); balances stockout risk (lost profit $1) vs. holding ($1/period); conservative start, adjust with future data.
