Carry-over insight: P44 order (200 units, placed P44) overdue beyond LT3 (no P47 arrival), lost/delay pattern re-emerging after P43-45 consistency; no arrivals P46-47 (2 periods); demand upward volatility sustained P37-47 avg121 vs P27-36 avg98 (+23%), 11 periods std~50 (spikes 186/184/156/137, low 24).

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent pattern stabilized to LT=2-3 (e.g., P40-43 orders arrived P43-45), but no arrivals in P46-48 concludes (3 periods), P44 order (200u, placed P44) overdue past LT3 (expected by P47, no arrival by P48), confirming lost shipment; in-transit 2181 heavily inflated with losses (historical pattern), no reliable pipeline incoming for P49 or near-term. Inventory: On-hand=0 entering P49, arrivals resolve after decision so P49 demand (~100-150) will cause stockout unless immediate LT=0 (unlikely); total pipeline unreliable. Demand analysis: Upward volatility sustained P37-48 (12 periods avg~118, std~50, highs 186/184/156/137 lows 24/62), outperforms prior P27-36 avg98 (+20%); chips(Regular) no calendar/seasonal cues, forecast single-period \u03bc=120 \u03c3=50. OR=0 ignores lost shipments and actual LT variability, assumes high pipeline covers base-stock (likely using promised L=2, full history \u03bc~106); uncapped would order to cover review+L+1=3 periods but caps low due to fake pipeline. Strategy: Override OR aggressively with 200 units to rebuild real pipeline covering ~1.5-2x recent \u03bc + safety for volatility/LT=3 (arrives ~P52 but builds for any earlier delivery; near game-end P50 minimizes long holding risk); consistent with prior overrides (150-200) during unreliability.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 200 units - in-transit 2181 mostly lost (P44 confirmed overdue/lost), on-hand 0 risks P49 stockout on ~120 avg demand; recent upward volatility P37-48 avg~118 requires rebuilding reliable pipeline despite LT=2-3 and no recent arrivals.",
  "carry_over_insight": "P44 order (200u) lost confirmed (no arrival by P48 conclude, 4 periods past placement/LT3); no arrivals P46-48 (3 periods) re-emerging lost shipment pattern. Demand upward volatility sustained P37-48 avg~118 vs P27-36 98 (+20%), 12 periods std~50.",

{

Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P50 (stockout in P49 with demand=120); no expected near-term arrivals based on pattern.
