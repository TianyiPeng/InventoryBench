  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates provided; 'chips(Regular)' is staple snack with steady demand, occasional spikes/variance from history, no strong seasonal drivers identifiable. (b) Demand regime stable recent P43-49 avg ~105 (range 24-156, outliers P46 low/P45 high), aligns with P32-38 avg ~110 per carry-over; P39-41 spike (175 avg) not sustained (P42-49 reverted); overall long-term avg ~105-120 with high variance. (c) Recent LT 2-3 periods confirmed (P40\u2192P43 LT3, P41\u2192P44 LT3, P42\u2192P45 LT3, P43\u2192P45 LT2; 4 instances); no arrivals P46-P49 signals P45 order (140u placed P45) overdue past LT=3 (due P48, no P48/P49 arr), potential loss (1 instance, monitor); prior loss pattern (~45%) paused recently but may resume; LT=1-2 not sustained recently. (d) On-hand=0 (stockouts P48:57u, P49:120u lost sales); in-transit=1620u bloated (likely incl. prior losses inflating pipeline); recent small orders (P44/46/47=0u, P45/48/49=140u each) explain coverage gap. (e) Order 160u: above recent avg 110-120 to recover stockouts (lost ~180u P48-49, $720 profit), cover ~1.3x expected demand for LT+1~4 periods variability; conservative vs pipeline excess but prioritizes sales ($4p/u) over holding ($1p/u); matches recent order sizing w/ uplift.",
  "carry_over_insight": "P45 order (140u) overdue past LT=3 (no P48-P49 arrival); potential loss resumption (1 instance after recent reliable streak, monitor for sustainment); LT=2-3 recent predominant (4 instances P40-43 orders).",
