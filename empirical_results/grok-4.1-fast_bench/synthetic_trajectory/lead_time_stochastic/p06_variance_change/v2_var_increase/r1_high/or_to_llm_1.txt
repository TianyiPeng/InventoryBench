Demand analysis: Recent P40-49 avg=117 (range 24-186, volatile); aligns with carry-over volatility P36-42 avg=106 and prior regimes (P6-14 ~120, later ~110); no seasonality/calendar anchors. OR recommends 0 due to high (ghost) pipeline and promised L=2, but ignores ghosts/losses - uncapped order_raw likely negative vs base-stock. Strategy: Override OR, order 200 to cover ~1.5-2 periods expected demand (117*2=234, conservative cap-like) over actual L~3 + review, prioritizing sales (profit $19 >> hold $1); matches recent successful order sizes (e.g., P41-43, P48-49) that eventually arrived.",
