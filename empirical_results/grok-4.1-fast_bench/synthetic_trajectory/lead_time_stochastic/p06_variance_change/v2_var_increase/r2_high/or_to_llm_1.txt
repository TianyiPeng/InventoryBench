{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows actual LT=1-3 periods (e.g., recent P40 order arrived P43 LT=3, P34 P36 LT=2); many orders lost after 3+ periods without arrival (carry-over confirms patterns: P44, P33, prior batches totaling 1056u lost by P48, now in-transit 1456u = prior lost 1056 + P48:250 + P49:150, no recent arrivals in P47-P49 concludes, effective pipeline=0). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P50 (P49 stockout: demand=148 sold=0), no expected arrivals this period (recent orders P48/P49 too recent for LT>=1, prior pipeline lost), high stockout risk. Demand analysis: Low volatile regime sustained P38-P49 (12 periods avg~78, std~58, spikes 163/148/137/125 vs lows 0/6/13); recent 5 periods P45-P49 avg111 but volatile (includes 56 low), no confirmed upshift (conservative per guidelines); historical early avg~110, OR uses full history/promised LT (mean~110? but recommends 0 likely overestimating pipeline ignoring losses). Strategy: Override OR's 0 (ignores losses/low effective inv) with 250u to target base-stock for LT+1=4 periods (~80*4=320, safety buffer for volatility/std*2~120, cap to 250 per prior successful orders like P38/P48 when restocking); covers expected ~80 + upside spikes, holding cost low ($1 vs $19 profit), prioritizes sales vs risk repeated P49-scale stockout.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 250 units - effective pipeline=0 (1456u confirmed lost pattern, no recent arrivals), on-hand=0 risks stockout like P49 (148 demand), recent volatile demand avg~78 with spikes to 163 needs 4-period LT+1 coverage (~320 target).",
