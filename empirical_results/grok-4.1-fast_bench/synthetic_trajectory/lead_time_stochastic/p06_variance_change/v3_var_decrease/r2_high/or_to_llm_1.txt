No new losses confirmed in P49. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 exposes P50 to potential full stockout (~100 demand) if no P50 arrival, but partial coverage from recent patterns expected. In-transit=2033 bloated by ~1483 known lost shipments (per carry-over up to P44/P48), yielding effective pipeline ~550 units (1633-1483 prior effective ~150 + P48/P49 orders 400). Demand analysis: Stable regime avg~102 (P12-P49 recent consistent 90-135, latest P49=109; sd~15 low). No calendar/product seasonality signals.
