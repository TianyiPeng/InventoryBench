Forecast P14+ ~150-200/period. (c) Lead time: Variability LT=1 or 3 confirmed (e.g., P9\u2192P12 LT3, P12 no-arrival P13 confirms its LT=3 expected P15); lost shipments sustained (P2:150, P6:100 stuck in-transit indefinitely, ~20% order loss rate); P13:150 pending (LT1\u2192P14 or LT3\u2192P16). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0 (P13 stockout: sold94<demand121); in-transit 550 = 250 lost (P2+P6) + 300 pending real (P12:150\u2192P15 LT3, P13:150\u2192P14? or P16); P14 coverage risky (0 + possible 150 if P13 LT1 - ~170 demand). (e) Final order logic: Order 200 to cover 1-2 periods high demand (~170\xd72=340) minus partial pipeline (300 pending but delayed/variable/loss risk), build buffer vs stockouts (opp cost $19>>holding $1); aligns past P1:200 high-demand response.",
