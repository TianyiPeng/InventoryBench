No new LT observations. Promised LT=2 unreliable. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (depleted in P48 after demand=135 >93 starting); in-transit=848 includes all lost orders indefinitely (carry-over ~850+ units lost total, e.g., P37, P24, P19 etc.), so effective pipeline ~0 - OR cannot see/discounted this, inflates its pipeline_inventory leading to 0 rec. Demand analysis: Historical full avg ~85-100; recent 10P (P39-48) avg 98.6 (76-135), last 3P avg 111 (+12% but small sample); steady non-seasonal snack demand ~100/period, no calendar shifts.

Covers ~1.5x expected demand; with LT var (chance LT=1 for P50 arrival) and endgame (P49/50), balances stockout loss vs holding (q=0.5); avoids overorder as late arrivals (LT=2+ post-P50) useless/not penalized but lost shipments pattern high.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent concludes (P46-P49) show no arrivals (4 consecutive periods), extending prior droughts (e.g., P37-P42:6 periods); LT variability persists (1-3 observed historically, e.g., P40->P43 LT3, P41->P44 LT3, P43->P45 LT2), but no new LT confirmations; P49 order (150 units) placed P49 could arrive P50 if LT=1 (sporadic, last P32->P33), but high loss risk per pattern (e.g., P37 lost, total losses ~850+ units). Pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=998 bloated by persistent lost shipments (never conclude, stay in-transit); effective near-term inflow low/none expected beyond possible P49 LT1. Demand analysis: Recent P46-P49: 107,91,135,109 (avg 110.5, up ~11% from prior ~99); longer P43-P49 avg ~107; volatile but sustained ~110 level; stockouts P48 (lost 42 potential), P49 (109 lost), total 244 missed sales. OR recommendation: 0 units - overly conservative, ignores bloated pipeline from losses, recent droughts/stockouts, demand uptick; uses promised LT=2 + full history (diluted by early volatility). Strategy: Override OR's 0 to order 200 units for coverage over LT+1~4 periods (440 expected demand) minus minimal reliable pipeline, balancing stockout risk (profit loss) vs holding; consistent with past overrides during droughts (e.g., P41:300).",
