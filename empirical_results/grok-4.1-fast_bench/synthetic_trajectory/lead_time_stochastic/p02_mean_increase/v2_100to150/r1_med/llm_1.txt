(b) Demand regimes: prior upshift P39-43 avg178 (+31% vs P31-38~136, sustained 5p per P44 insight); P44-49 volatile alternating low~136 (P44:133,46:135,48:137)/high~185 (45:185,47:181,49:189), avg160 sustained 6p, confirming post-upshift volatility around 160 (vs prior downshift 139); forecast P50 (even period pattern) likely low ~140-160. (c) LT variability LT=1-3 sustained (recent ex: P40@43 LT3, P41@44 LT3, P42@45 LT3, P43@45 LT2); delivery failures reemerging - no arrivals P46-49 (4 consec periods per history/P49 insight extension), overdue ex P44 order 200u (placed P44 LT3 exp P47, overdue 3p past), P47 170u (exp P49-50), P48 180u (exp P50-51); no confirmed losses yet but streak signals risk; promised LT2 unreliable. (d) On-hand 0 (stockouts P48-49 demand137+189=326 lost sales); in-transit 2590 massive (cumulative orders piling amid delays, ex recent P44-49:200+170+180+180=730u+earlier); pipeline covers many periods if arrives but delayed. (e) Order 180 to cover P50 forecast ~160 + safety for LT3+ delays/stockout risk (profit $4>holding $1); conservative vs massive transit to limit overstock, balances lost sales vs future holding; targets service while pipeline clears.",
