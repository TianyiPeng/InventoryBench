P30 order (200u) likely LT=2 (expected P32). P31 order (200u) LT=2 expected P33.

Subsequent arrivals (P31 LT2 P33) and any others maintain coverage.

OR recommendation: 0 units (appropriate given nominal pipeline 1453 >> base-stock ~3*134 mean=402 + safety ~500, using full hist mean ~134 pulled down by early lows). Adjustment: No override needed - effective recent pipeline ~600u covers 3-4 high-demand periods (510-680), avoiding stockouts (as arrivals precede demand) and excess holding (q=0.8 favors sales but current coverage ample).
