{
  "rationale": "(a) Chips(Regular) is a standard snack product with steady demand drivers; no calendar dates provided, so no seasonal/event anchors; rely on historical regimes. (b) Demand stable in high regime: P39-P49 avg ~196 (271/172/164/175/167/241/194/149/214/208/200), consistent with extended high ~190-200 vs early ~93; recent P46-P49 avg 193, no sustained shift (variance normal, no 3+ period up/down). (c) LT stable 1-3 periods pre-P46 (e.g., P40-P43 arrivals LT3/2/3); now arrived=0 sustained P46-P49 (4 periods); P44 order (240u placed P44, expected P47 LT3) overdue ~6 periods past expected (no P47-P49); P45 (220u P45 expected P48) overdue ~4 periods; P49 (280u) fresh LT1-3 expected P50-P52; sporadic misses extended, older in-transit likely phantom/lost. (d) On-hand=0 (P49 ending); in-transit=3140 mostly accumulated lost (historical misses ~2500u est., recent real ~740u P44/45/49); P50 starting=0 + possible arrivals (P49 LT1? or none as recent pattern), high stockout risk for ~200 demand. Pipeline covers long-term but unreliable short-term due to misses/delays. (e) Order 280 to cover 1-2 periods demand (~200) + safety buffer for LT3+1 horizon amid no recent arrivals/stockouts (P48 partial/135 sold vs208, P49 full 200 lost); matches P49 order size; prioritizes sales (19p vs1h) over holding given phantom pipeline.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Recent delivery misses extended: arrived=0 sustained 4 periods P46-P49; P44 (240u) overdue 6+ periods (placed P44 expected P47 LT3, no by P49); P45 (220u) overdue 4+ periods (placed P45 expected P48, no by P49).",
