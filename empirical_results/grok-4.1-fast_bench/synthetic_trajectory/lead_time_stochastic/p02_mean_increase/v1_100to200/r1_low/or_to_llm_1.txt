Recent arrivals ended at P45 (P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2, P41 LT=3 in P44), confirming pattern of LT>=3 common, with losses (e.g., P37 likely lost). Promised LT=2 unreliable; treat in-transit as highly suspect. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0, risking stockout in P50 (demand ~220); in-transit=3013 massive but unreliable (893+ lost previously, many >6-9 overdue like P37,P44?); effective pipeline near-zero for near-term. Demand analysis: Sustained high regime since P16 (avg~225 P16-18, recent P40-49 avg=192, P46-49 avg=217 on 229/200/203/237); consistent 200+ past 20+ periods vs early ~100. No calendar/product seasonality cues. OR recommendation: 0 units - uses promised LT=2, full-history mean (~low due to early data), assumes reliable pipeline > base stock (\u03bc\u0302 + 0*\u03c3\u0302 since q=0.5, z=0); ignores regime shift/high demand, losses/delays. Final strategy: Override OR's 0 to 220 units - matches recent demand avg (~220), prior replenishment levels (P47-49:220), builds new pipeline for LT~2-3 coverage (current +2-3 periods ~660, but phased); avoids indefinite stockouts (4+ periods already, lost sales costing profit=1/unit) while limiting exposure (holding=1/period, but unreliable arrivals mitigate hold risk).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 0 to 220 units - recent demand avg ~217 (P46-49), on-hand 0, no arrivals 4 periods (P46-49) despite pending orders confirms chronic pipeline unreliability/losses requiring ongoing replenishment.",
  "carry_over_insight": "No arrivals in P46-P49 concludes (4 consecutive periods) despite recent P47-P49 orders (660 units expected LT=2 by now), extends chronic delay/loss pattern with 3013 in-transit increasingly unreliable.",

Carry-over insight: No arrivals in P46-P49 concludes (4 consecutive periods) despite recent P47-P49 orders (660 units expected LT=2 by now), extends chronic delay/loss pattern with 3013 in-transit increasingly unreliable.
