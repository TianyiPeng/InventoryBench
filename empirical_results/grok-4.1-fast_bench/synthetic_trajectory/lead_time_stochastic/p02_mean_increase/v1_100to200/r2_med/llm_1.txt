  "rationale": "(a) chips(Regular): Standard snack chips, no calendar dates provided, no major seasonal or event drivers identifiable; demand driven by historical patterns. (b) Demand regime sustained high: P44-P49 avg=201 (241,194,149,214,208,200), consistent with carry-over P44-P48 avg=201 (+115% vs early avg=93), no new shift. (c) Lead time recently 2-3 periods (P43-P45 arrivals: LT=2-3); no arrivals P46-P49 (4 consecutive, extending P49-noted resumption of losses); P44(250u)/P45(450u) lost as per carry-over; P49 order(250u) pending (expected ~P51-52); high loss risk persists, in-transit accumulates indefinitely without arrivals. (d) On-hand=0 (stockout risk P50), in-transit=3270 likely mostly lost/unreliable pipeline (no recent arrivals); effective pipeline ~0 despite volume. (e) Forecast P50 demand ~200; with LT~3 + losses, order 250 to cover 1-2 periods post-arrival, rebuild reliable inventory aggressively vs. holding cost (prioritize sales at $4/unit over $1 holding).",
