No new confirms this period. Lost shipments: P2(153u), P6(120u) confirmed previously, totaling 273u never arriving. Pipeline breakdown: In-transit 593u = lost 273u + P15 order 120u (likely LT=3, arrives P18) + P17 order 200u (LT=1 arrives P18, LT=2 P19, or LT=3 P20).

Historical losses sustained (~3243u inferred lost by P43, total in-transit 3643u includes lost + pending). No new LT patterns sustained over 3+ periods.

Pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=4043u (high due to cumulative unconfirmed orders), but carry-over indicates ~3243u already inferred lost historically with frequent confirmations (e.g., P33/P34/P37 lost); recent no arrivals in P46-47 despite pending suggests continued unreliability - actual available pipeline likely <<4043u.
