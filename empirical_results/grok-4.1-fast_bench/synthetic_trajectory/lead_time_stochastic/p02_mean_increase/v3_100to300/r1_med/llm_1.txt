  "rationale": "(a) Chips(Regular): standard snack product, no calendar dates provided, no specific seasonal drivers identifiable; steady high demand regime dominates over any generic patterns. (b) Demand regime: sustained high since P16 (avg ~282 P16-22, upward to ~324 P23-25, recent P46-49 avg 276 (285,311,228,281), overall P40+ avg ~285; no new shift (P48 dip to 228 isolated, not sustained 3+ periods). (c) Lead time: mixed 1-3 periods recently (e.g., P45: lt=3/2; prior stabilization at 2 around P25-30 but inconsistent); loss pattern persists/strengthens - P44 order (400 units) confirmed lost (no arrival P46-P49 despite 3+ periods past expected lt=2-3 arrival P46-47). (d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0 (stockout risk P50); in-transit=5250 bloated by chronic losses (historical total ~2400+ units lost, remains indefinitely); expected P50 arrivals uncertain (possible P48 order 400 if lt=2, P49 400 if lt=1, but loss risk high); no reliable near-term pipeline coverage. (e) Final order logic: forecast ~280 demand/period; order 400 to replenish unreliable pipeline, cover 1-2 periods demand post-LT=2 while minimizing excess holding (net positive: 4 profit vs 1 holding); consistent with recent sizing amid losses/stockouts (P48-49).",
  "carry_over_insight": "P44 order (400 units) confirmed lost: no arrival by P49 conclude (3+ periods past expected P46-47 for lt=2-3); loss pattern strengthened (total ~2400 units over 6 instances P29/30/33/37/38/44, sustained).",
