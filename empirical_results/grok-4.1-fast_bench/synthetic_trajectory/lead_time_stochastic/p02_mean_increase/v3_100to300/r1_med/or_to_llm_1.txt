  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but historical variability (1-3 periods) with frequent losses sustained per carry-over; no arrivals in P46-P47 concludes (P45-P47 orders overdue past LT=1-2), reinforcing unreliable pipeline and effective incoming=0 despite transit=4907 bloated (losses accumulate as prior patterns show e.g., P37/P42/P44 losses). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P48, no reliable arrivals expected for P48 (recent pattern of sporadic arrivals only), so P48 demand (~290) will stockout; bloated transit ineffective for coverage. Demand analysis: High regime sustained P16-47 avg ~290 (+165% vs P1-15 ~110), recent P43-47 avg 291 (271-311 range, P47=311 confirms persistence/volatility); no dates/product specifics but chips align with steady high demand phase. OR recommendation: 0 units, which assumes reliable pipeline covers base-stock (\u03bc\u0302~(1+2)*recent mean, huge pipeline subtracts to 0), but ignores losses/variability - unsafe given effective pipeline=0 and stockouts (e.g., P47 sold only 244/311). Strategy: Override OR with 400 units (consistent with prior high-demand orders P23+ that occasionally arrived LT=1-3); covers ~1-1.5 periods demand if arrives, hedges end-game periods 48-50 stockouts while minimizing overorder risk (holding only if arrives late); total periods=50 limits exposure.",

Promised LT=2 unreliable. Inventory: On-hand=0 entering P49, transit=5307 ineffective (historical pattern of losses, no recent reliable inflows). Demand analysis: High regime persists P16-48 (avg ~288, recent P44-48 avg 276 despite P48=228 single dip; +165% vs P1-15 ~110); stockouts frequent (e.g., P48 sold=0 vs demand=228).

Strategy: Override OR with 400 units to cover expected P49-P50 demand ~290/period (2 periods remaining); aggressive ordering justified as transit incurs no holding cost, losses sunk, prioritizes avoiding $4/unit lost sales over uncertain arrivals.

OR recommendation: 0 units, overly conservative due to bloated transit (assumes reliable pipeline with promised LT=2, ignores losses/variability). Strategy adjustment: Override OR completely; order 400 to cover ~1.4 periods of high demand (~290/period), building buffer against LT uncertainty/losses and avoiding further stockouts (lost profit $4/unit > holding $1); consistent with prior overrides during high regime/stockouts; since P50 may be final (50/50), prioritize sales over holding risk.",
