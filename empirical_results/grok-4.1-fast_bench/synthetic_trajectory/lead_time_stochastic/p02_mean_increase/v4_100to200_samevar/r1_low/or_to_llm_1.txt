P45 order of 230 units (placed P45) absent in P46 conclude, confirming LT>=2 for it, expected arrival possibly P47 (LT=2). Sporadic 'losses' often resolve as LT=3 delays (e.g., P42 arrived P45 after suspicion). No new losses confirmed in P46. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=26 (critically low vs expected demand ~220), in-transit=1754 (nominal high but unreliable - history of losses/delays inflate it; carry-over estimates prior stuck ~2284 adjusted by late arrivals). Expected P47 arrivals may include P45's 230 (LT=2), providing ~256 OH pre-demand, selling ~220 leaving ~36; without it, major stockout.

OR limitations: Ignores loss/delay pattern, uses promised LT=2, equal-weights old low-demand history pulling mu down. Adjustment strategy: Override OR's 0 upwards to 220 - hedges unreliable pipeline (effective pipeline lower due to sporadic losses/delays), covers expected LT+1=3-4 periods demand (~660-880) for P48-P50 while minimizing end-game holding risk (order arrives P48-P50, sellable before P50 end).

Expected arrivals in P49 uncertain - possible LT=3 for P46 order (220, placed P46), but pattern suggests risk of absence. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (stockout in P48, demand=174>sold=0); in-transit=2194 inflated by confirmed lost shipments (cumulative ~2300+ units stuck per history, e.g., P40 arrived late after 'lost' label but many others never).
