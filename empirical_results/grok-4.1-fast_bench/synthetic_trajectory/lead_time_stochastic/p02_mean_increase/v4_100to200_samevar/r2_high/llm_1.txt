(d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 70 critically low (covers <1 period demand); in-transit 3120 ample (~15 periods @200/demand) but loss risk erodes effective coverage; expected P45 arrivals uncertain (possible from P42/P43/P44 orders if LT=1-3); cumulative pipeline covers remaining 6 periods (45-50) with buffer despite losses. (e) Final order logic: order 240 to maintain pipeline fill rate matching recent strategy/service level, hedging LT variability/losses (avg ~200 demand + safety); avoids overorder near end given high transit but prioritizes avoiding stockouts (P45 risk high w/ low on-hand); balances profit vs holding.",
