Order placed in P49 would arrive P51+ (post-game end at P50), providing no sales benefit.

Recent demand stable high regime P36+ avg~100-110 (carry-over confirmed to P44, P45-P48:80/80/99/85 avg86, std~9, no downward shift). OR recommends 0 using promised LT=2 and full history mean/variance - aligns perfectly as base-stock exceeded by pipeline/on-hand for remaining 2 periods.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variability (LT=1,2,3 common; recent arrivals in P45 from P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2; dry spell P46-P49 no arrivals despite in-transit). No new concluded arrivals in P49 confirm ongoing delays/lost pattern for prior orders (e.g., P44=0, but earlier large pipeline). Inventory: On-hand=0 entering P50 (stock near-out P49: sold=99/101 demand), in-transit=1352 (massive but unreliable per carry-over lost patterns; possible P50 arrivals from overdue orders, but recent 4-period dry spell risks none). Demand analysis: High regime sustained P36-P49 avg~107 (14 periods, std~15, demands 72-120 mostly ~100), vs prior low P25-P37 avg70 (+53%); no calendar/dates for seasonality, chips generic snack stable. OR rec=0 (likely base_stock < pipeline 1352 using promised LT=2/all-history demand). Adjustment: Follow OR=0 unchanged. Critical: Period 50/50 is FINAL; order placed in P50 decision arrives in P50+LT (>=51+), AFTER game end - zero impact on sales/holding. Optimal to order 0; rely on potential P50 arrivals from pipeline for demand~100.",
