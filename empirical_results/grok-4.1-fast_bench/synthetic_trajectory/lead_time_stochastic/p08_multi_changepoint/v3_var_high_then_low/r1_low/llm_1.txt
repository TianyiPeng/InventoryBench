(d) Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0 (P48 depleted), in-transit=1710 inflated by historical losses (effective pipeline unreliable, recent gaps confirm); covers uncertain future but P49 demand unmet. (e) Order logic: near end (P49/50), order 120 for expected ~90 P50 demand (assumes LT=1-2 arrival P50/P51, P51 post-end irrelevant); balances sales vs holding (low safety due losses/gaps), replenishes depletion without overstocking given unreliable pipeline.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Arrivals gap extended to 3 periods P46-48 (consistent with prior patterns, no exceedance of 5p max); demand volatile stabilization ~87 avg P43-48 (6 periods, -18% vs P36-44 ~106 but within higher regime variance, not new regime).",

  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates provided; chips(Regular) is steady snack demand without strong seasonal drivers evident. (b) Demand regime: higher post-low (P36-44 avg~110) transitioned to volatile stabilization ~89 avg P43-49 (72,105,80,80,99,85,101), consistent ~90-100 recently with P49=101 confirming no rebound to prior highs. (c) Lead time variable 1-3 periods recently (e.g., P43 LT3/P40, P44 LT3/P41, P45 LT3/P42 & LT2/P43); lost shipments sustained (~940 units confirmed prior, in-transit 1830 likely inflated by unarrived/lost); arrivals gap extended P46-49=0 (4 periods, within prior max 5p patterns). No new LT confirms in P49. (d) On-hand=0 (stockout P49 on 101 demand); in-transit=1830 unreliable per history/losses/gaps, no expected near-term arrivals (gap ongoing). Pipeline effectively low despite quantity. (e) Forecast ~100/period (recent avg89-110 range); order 120 to cover 1-2 periods demand + minimal buffer vs LT2-3/loss risk, balancing stockouts (recent lost sales P49=101, P48=21) vs holding cost; conservative vs aggressive given profit=holding=1.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Arrivals gap extended to 4 consecutive periods P46-49 (all arrived=0, first 4p gap since prior 5p max P31-35); lost shipments pattern sustained with ongoing pipeline failure.",
