Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: P49 conclude shows arrived=0, consistent with unreliable patterns (no new arrivals); recent orders like P47 (120, placed P47) could arrive P50 if LT=3 (max observed), but history shows frequent losses beyond (e.g., P44/P45 confirmed lost); effective pipeline remains 0 despite 1412 in-transit (sum of accumulated lost shipments per carry-over). Inventory: on-hand=0 entering P50, guaranteeing stockout for P50 demand (~100) unless rare arrival; treat total pipeline as lost/unreliable. Demand analysis: Recent P43-P49 demands (72,105,80,80,99,85,101) avg 88.9 (-20% vs P36-P42 avg ~111), 7-period sustained low regime with volatility but clear mean shift; full history early avg ~95, but prioritize recent for forecast \u03bc\u224890. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock policy sees high in-transit 1412 covering far beyond base-stock ~3*95=285, capped at 0), but ignores lost shipments and actual LT unreliability. Strategy: Override OR upwards as effective pipeline=0; target base-stock for promised L=2 (cover 3 periods: 3*90=270) but cap conservatively at ~120 (historical order size, aligns with OR cap logic \u03bc+1.645\u03c3\u224890+50=140, avoids overordering into loss risk); builds buffer against stockouts while minimizing holding exposure given LT losses.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 120 units - in-transit 1412 effectively lost (per sustained pattern), on-hand=0 risks stockout on ~90-100 demand; 120 covers 1-2 periods pending sporadic arrivals.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand low regime strengthened P43-P49 avg 89 (-20% vs P36-P42 ~110, 7 consistent periods); reinforces prior low shift signal.",
