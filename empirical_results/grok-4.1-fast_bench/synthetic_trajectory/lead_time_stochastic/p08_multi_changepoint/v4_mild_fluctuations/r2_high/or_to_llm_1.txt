{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent dominant LT=2 (carry-over P32), but no recent arrivals since P45 (LT=2/3 for P43/P42); all tracked shipments either arrived or lost. Inventory analysis: On-hand=87 covers ~1 period demand (~93 recent avg P40-49); in-transit=1446 exactly matches sum of confirmed lost shipments (P2=124, P6=52, P17=120, P19=180, P25=250, P30=350, P37=120, now incl. P45=250), so effective pipeline=0, no expected arrivals in P50 or soon (recent orders=0). Demand analysis: Recent 10 periods (P40-49) avg=93, std~19 (stable ~90-100, no new regime shift vs P34-42 avg90). OR recommends 0 using promised L=2 and full history, treating in-transit as reliable (pipeline position=87+1446>>base_stock ~330), but ignores losses. Strategy: Override naive OR pipeline assumption; however, as Period 50/50 (likely final), P50 order arrives LT>=1 (P51+), post-game, adds no sales value and risks junk in-transit if lost (no holding cost but no benefit). Hold 87 for P50 demand, accept potential minor stockout, order 0 to avoid unnecessary action.",
