{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LTs remain variable 1-3 periods (e.g., P41 order arrived P44 LT=3; P42 LT=3 P45; P43 LT=2 P45; P40 LT=3 P43), consistent with carry-over sustained pattern. No-arrivals in P46-P47 (2 periods only) and P44 order (150 units) overdue by 1 period (expected P47), but not prolonged enough (>=5-6 periods) to confirm new lost shipment streak resumption. In-transit 923 units presumed intact, covering extensive future needs. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 exposes P48 to stockout risk (demand ~134 expected), but post-decision arrivals possible (e.g., overdue P44); total pipeline=923 >> needs for remaining 3 periods (3*134=402). Demand analysis: High regime sustained P36-P47 (12 periods) avg 134 (+123% vs P13-P35 low avg 60), with recent P45-47 avg 106 volatile but P47=140 confirms no drop; aligns with prior P3-P12 high ~115-126, no calendar/product info to override. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock policy sees pipeline 923 >> mu_hat + safety using full-history lower mean ~70-90 and promised LT=2). Adjustment: Follow OR unchanged - massive pipeline buffers high demand through P50 endgame, ordering adds unnecessary holding risk if arrivals burst soon (as in past patterns P23, P37); conservatively avoids overstock with low periods left.",

No-arrivals streak P46-P48 (3 periods) despite expected P44 arrival signals emerging lost resumption. Pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=923 but unreliable due to confirmed losses (e.g., P44 lost, prior patterns); effective pipeline \u22480 given no arrivals since P45 and stockouts in P47-P48.

OR recommendation: 0 units (likely due to promised LT=2, full historical demand avg, and high reported pipeline 923 exceeding base-stock ~ (1+2)*90 + safety); ignores losses, actual LT variability, recent high regime.
