(d) Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0 (stockout risk immediate); in-transit 2260 unreliable (drought + losses); covers multiple periods if arrive but probable losses mean low effective pipeline. (e) Order logic: Prioritize avoiding stockouts (lost profit $19/unit >> holding $1); order 200 covers expected ~140 demand + safety buffer for LT variability/losses/drought; matches recent high orders, builds on-hand proactively given unreliability.",
