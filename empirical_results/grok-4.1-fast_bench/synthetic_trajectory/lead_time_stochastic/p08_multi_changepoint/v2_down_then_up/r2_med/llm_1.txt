(b) Demand regime analysis: High regime from P36-P48 sustained (13 periods, avg ~137; recent P46-P48: 97/140/152 avg 130, minor dip P45=80 but rebound confirms continuation vs prior carry-over avg144). Historical initial samples (P1-5 avg ~94) irrelevant now. Forecast P49 ~140 based on recent avg + high persistence. (c) Lead time vs missing orders: Recent LT=2-3 (e.g., P41\u219244 LT3, P42\u219245 LT3, P43\u219245 LT2); no arrivals P46-P48 signals ongoing losses (P44 ord200 overdue past LT=4 to P48, P45 ord200 overdue past LT=3; fits persistent pattern, many prior confirmed losses). Promised LT=2 unreliable. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=45 critically low (covers <1 period demand); in-transit=1270 massively inflated by chronic losses (~50%+ historical loss rate inferred), unreliable for near-term arrivals though possible LT=4-5 for P44/P45 in P49. Pipeline covers distant future at best. (e) Final order logic: Order 200 to target high demand forecast (140-150), replenish post-depletion (P45-48 sold ~389 from prior stock), prioritize sales capture ($4 profit > $1 holding) over LT=3 risk; conservative vs ballooned unreliable pipeline, aligns with prior high-regime orders (P40-45). Covers P49-P51+ needs assuming LT~3.",
  "carry_over_insight": "High demand regime extended P36-P48 avg137 (13 periods incl minor P45 dip, recent P46-P48 avg130 confirming sustainability); continued losses pattern: no arrivals P46-P48 (P44 200 & P45 200 overdue past LT=4/3, probable LT=5/4 P49 or lost consistent w/ prior).",

{
  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates provided; chips(Regular) is staple snack with no strong seasonal ties absent dates. Rely on history. (b) High demand regime sustained P36-P49 avg~140 (13+ periods 80-186, recent P46-P49 avg132, last3 P47-P49 avg144 confirming stability post-P45 dip). Forecast P50 ~140. (c) LT variable 1-3 historically, recent LT=3 (P40-43/41-44/42-45) but losses dominant (no arr P46-P49; P44/P45 orders 400 lost overdue LT=5; P49 200 pending LT>=1 unconfirmed). Losses pattern persists, in-transit 1470 mostly lost/illusory. (d) On-hand=0 (stockout P49 sold45/140); pipeline 1470 undependable, expect no P50 arrival (breaks LT=1 streak, aligns losses). Covers 0 periods reliably. (e) Order 200 to match recent high-regime sizing (P40-P45/P49), replenishes ~1.4 periods demand accounting LT uncertainty/loss risk; balances stockout cost (lost profit $560) vs holding ($200/period); conservative vs 3x=420 given unreliable supply.",
