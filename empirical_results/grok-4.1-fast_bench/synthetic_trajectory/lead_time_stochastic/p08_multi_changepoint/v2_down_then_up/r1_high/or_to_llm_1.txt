{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LT=3 (P40 order arrived P43, P41 order arrived P44); no new arrivals in P45-P48 concludes (4 periods stalled post LT=3 deliveries), suggesting potential LT>=4 or losses for recent orders (e.g., P47's 150 units expected ~P50 if LT=3). Promised LT=2 not holding; prior patterns of losses (e.g., even/odd, P30 lost) and high in-transit (1155 units) indicate ~30-50% loss risk based on history (e.g., P26:785 confirmed lost). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P49 (stockout risk immediate); in-transit=1155 covers theoretically ~10 periods at 118 avg demand but unreliable (stalled arrivals + loss patterns). Demand analysis: High regime sustained P36-48 (13 periods, avg 118, sum=1533; peaks 180/162/151, recent P46-48:125/117/120 confirms no softening despite dips like P44:75); vs prior low P23-35 avg51 (+130%). OR recommends 0 (uses full history avg ~85-90 pulled down by early/low periods, ignores regime shift/lead variability/losses, assumes promised LT=2 and reliable pipeline). Strategy: Override OR's 0 with 150 units (matches P47 order size, targets ~120-150 single-period mean + safety for LT=3+1=4 periods coverage ~500 but capped by cap/loss hedge; prioritizes avoiding stockouts at q=19/20=0.95 fractile given profit edge over holding; high pipeline hedge but history demands proactive ordering amid stalls/losses).",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LT=3 for P40->P43 (3 periods), P41->P44 (3 periods); no counter-evidence since, but arrivals stalled in P45-49 concludes (5 periods no arrivals), suggesting LT>=4 or emerging losses for recent orders (e.g., P47 LT would expect P50 arrival if=3, unconfirmed yet). Promised LT=2 not matching recent reality; historical variation (1/3) but stall dominant now. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 entering P50, will stockout P50 demand unless P50 arrival (possible P47 150 if LT=3); in-transit=1305 hugely inflated (past confirmed losses ~785 P26 + P30:120 + potential new = ~900+, unreliable). Demand analysis: High regime strongly sustained P36-49 (14 periods: demands 104,82,151,92,123,180,89,162,75,113,125,117,120,120; avg=118, +130% vs P23-35 avg51); consistent ~118-120 recently (P46-49:121 avg), peaks 180/162/151, dips 75/89 minor; stockouts nearly every period (sold < demand except minor holdings). No calendar/product seasonality cues (generic periods, chips regular). OR recommendation: 0 units - follows base-stock minus high pipeline, but ignores stall/losses over-relying on promised LT=2/all-history mean (diluted by pre-P36 low demand ~50s). Adjustment strategy: Override OR 0 to 150 units - matches recent high-demand orders (P40:150, P47:150, P49:150) that eventually arrived (P40/P41 did LT3); covers 1+ periods expected demand (118) + safety for LT uncertainty/stalls/loss risk; avoids over-ordering given holding $1 vs profit $19 (fractile ~0.95 favors stock); rebuilds reliable pipeline assuming in-transit partially lost.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 150 units - high demand sustained at ~118 avg over 14 periods (P36-49) with ongoing stockouts; arrivals stalled 5 periods (P45-49) despite 1305 in-transit (inflated by ~900+ historical losses), requiring proactive replenishment matching recent successful orders.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Arrivals stall extended P45-49 (5 periods no arrivals post LT=3 P40/P41 deliveries); Demand high regime sustained P36-49 avg 118 (+130% vs P23-35 avg51), 14 periods with continued stockouts (P49:120 fits).",
