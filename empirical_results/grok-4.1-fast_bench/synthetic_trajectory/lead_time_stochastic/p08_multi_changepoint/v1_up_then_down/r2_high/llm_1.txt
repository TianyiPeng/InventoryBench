  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates or product seasonal drivers provided; regular chips demand driven by historical patterns, no world knowledge anchors apply. (b) Demand regime: downshift confirmed and sustained P36+ (carry-over: P36-47 avg=76, -47% vs prior high; recent P44-49: 62,55,50,68,82,73 avg=65, consistent low ~65-80, 14+ periods total, no rebound or new shift. Forecast P50-P53 ~70/period. (c) Lead time: recent confirmed LT=3 (P40->P43, per carry-over P45-46); prior variability 1-3, no new arrivals P44-P49 so no updates; strong lost shipment pattern (multiple 200-unit losses like P24/25/29/30/33/37), treat in-transit 1990 as unreliable/likely lost (no arrivals despite time elapsed). Promised LT=2 irrelevant. (d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=130 covers ~2 periods (130/70); effective pipeline=0 (in-transit ghosts); depleting steadily P43 end=520 to P49=130 (~70/period), stockout risk P51-P52 if no order. (e) Final order logic: order 200 to cover LT=3 +1=4 periods demand (280) accounting for ~30% loss risk (effective ~140 arrival), buffer stockouts vs low holding cost; aligns with prior successful 200-unit replenishments during low regime while minimizing excess hold.",
