Inventory analysis: On-hand=1 (minimal, risks immediate stockout on ~100 demand), but in-transit=1811 units (enormous pipeline from past orders like P33(200)+others unarrived, many likely lost per pattern); current pipeline vastly exceeds 3-4 periods' demand (~300-400 at recent avg 100). Demand analysis: Recent P37-P40 demands=95,111,93,100 (avg 99, stable ~100 after P36 outlier 46); contrasts prior high P27-P35 avg~162, but no sustained low shift yet (only 4 periods). Earlier history ~100 avg. No calendar/product seasonality cues. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock policy subtracts massive pipeline from expected ~300 over LT+1=3 periods, capped at 0).

Demand analysis: Sustained low regime P36-P48 avg ~81 (e.g., P46:53, P47:81, P48:80), -50% vs prior high P27-P35 avg 162; no calendar/product info for shifts, historical early ~100 aligns closer to current low. OR recommendation: 0 units, logical as pipeline >> base-stock (OR uses promised LT=2, full history mean likely pulled low by recent, safety capped). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - unreliable pipeline heightens loss risk but quantity dwarfs 3-5 periods' demand (~240-400 at 80 avg); ordering adds to risky backlog without near-term benefit, prioritizes avoiding future holding over immediate stockout (profit=holding=1, fractile=0.5 neutral but pipeline asymmetry favors caution). Recent stockouts (P47-P48) due to stalls, not low pipeline.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows high variability (e.g., LT=3 for P42->P45, many losses like P24/P25/P29/P30 overdue 5-12+ periods past expected per carry-over); recent delivery stall P46-P49 (4 periods no arrivals in concludes) despite 2091 in-transit reinforces sustained high loss/delay risk - effective pipeline unreliable, likely many lost. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering Period 50, so risk immediate stockout if no arrival during Period 50 (probable given stall); 2091 in-transit huge but no holding cost until arrives, yet history shows long stalls lead to lost sales (e.g., P47-P49 lost 81+80+89=250 units). Demand analysis: Sustained low regime P36-P49 confirmed, recent 10 periods (P40-P49) avg demand=80 (range 53-111, std~15); no calendar/product info for seasonality. OR recommendation: 0 units - uses promised LT=2, full historical demand (diluted by past highs), ignores losses/stalls so underestimates stockout risk despite pipeline. Final strategy: Override OR 0 to 100 units (~recent demand avg) for immediate coverage hedging stall/loss risk; covers 1 period demand post-decision without overordering given low mean and equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5, minimal safety); expect pipeline to contribute eventually if/when arrives.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 100 units - on-hand 0 and delivery stall P46-P49 (4 periods no arrivals) risks immediate stockout on recent demand avg 80 despite 2091 unreliable in-transit.",
