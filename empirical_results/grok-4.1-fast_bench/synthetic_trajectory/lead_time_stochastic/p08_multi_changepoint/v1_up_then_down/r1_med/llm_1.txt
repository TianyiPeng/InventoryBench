{
  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates provided; 'chips(Regular)' is standard snack chips with baseline steady demand, no seasonal drivers evident. (b) Demand in sustained low regime P36-P49: 14 periods avg~82 (-47% vs P27-P35 avg158), recent P46-P49 (53,81,80,89) avg76 consistent, no new shift; forecast P50 ~80-90. (c) Lead times historically variable (1-3 periods confirmed via arrives msgs, e.g. P45: LT3/2), chronic lost shipments pattern sustained (no arrives P46-P49 concludes=4 periods despite expected from prior orders like P43-P46 pipeline); in-transit 2590 likely includes many lost (prior patterns P2/P6/etc.). No new LT confirmations; losses imply unreliable arrivals (possible 0 in P50). (d) On-hand=0 (stockout P49), heavy pipeline 2590 but chronic losses mean unreliable coverage for P50+; recent arrives sparse post-P45. (e) Order conservatively for low demand ~85 + safety stock 1 period (~100 total), balancing lost sales ($4 profit) vs holding ($1); avoids overstock given unreliable pipeline/massive in-transit; aligns with recent orders (P49:100).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Lost streak extended P46-P49 (4 periods no arrivals despite expected from P44-P47 orders LT2-3); demand low regime P36-P49 avg82 sustained 14 periods (-47% vs P27-P35 avg158).",
