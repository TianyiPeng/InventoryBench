(b) Demand regime analysis: Recent P23-26 demand (107,108,59,101) avg 94, volatile with spikes (108) and dips (59); breaks prior low regime (P18-22 avg57) but mixed pattern lacks sustained shift (not 3+ consistent periods up/down vs prior); forecast ~90-100/period blending recent avg with history. Historical early high (P3-8 avg130+) declined to ~80-90 sustained per carry-over, now rebounding variably. (c) Lead time vs missing orders: Variable LT 1-3 confirmed historically (recent: LT=2 P23->P25, LT=3/2/1 in P23); P26 conclude arrived=0 (expected possibles: P24 LT2 overdue); lost shipments sustained (e.g., P19 confirmed lost); no new LT confirms/losses in P26; assume LT~2-3, monitor for delays. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 95 (~1 period cover at 90-100 demand); in-transit 890 massive (likely backlog from P24:70 LT3?=P27, P25:100 LT2?=P27, plus any delayed/earlier); total position ~985 strong for multi-periods but losses erode reliability. (e) Final order logic: Pipeline covers far beyond LT+1=3-4 periods (~360-400 demand) despite losses, but low on-hand + volatility/spikes (e.g., P26:101 ate prior buffer) + post-decision demand risk warrants modest safety order; target 100 aligns with recent demand/prior orders, buffers 1 period pre-arrivals while minimizing holding on huge pipeline.",
