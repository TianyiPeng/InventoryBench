{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: History and carry-over confirm LT variability (1-3 periods) with sporadic losses (e.g., recent LT=3 for P40->P43, P42->P45); no new concluded arrivals in P46-P48, consistent with ongoing pipeline delays/variability; promised LT=2 not reliable. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 at start of P49, but in-transit=1322 units (sum of outstanding orders like P48:150, P47:0 but prior builds); ample coverage even if LT=3+ for some, as expected remaining demand ~100-150/period x 2 periods = 200-300 units max, far below pipeline. Demand outlook: Historical mean ~90 (from initial samples + full history avg ~95), recent volatile (P45-48:114,148,137,67 avg~117) but no sustained regime shift; no calendar/dates for seasonality. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and historical demand; aligns perfectly as pipeline grossly exceeds base-stock needs (OR likely sees high pipeline relative to \u03bc\u0302=(1+2)*\u03bc\u0304 ~270 + safety). Strategy: Follow OR with no override - ordering >0 risks excess ending inventory (holding cost=$1/unit) at game end P50, while 1322 in-transit ensures no stockouts; prioritize minimizing hold on surplus.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Actual LT remains variable (1-3 periods) per history and carry-over (e.g., P40->P43 LT=3, P42->P45 LT=3); no new concludes in P49 confirm arrivals or losses (P48 order=150 likely arrives P49-P51 based on LT=1-3, not yet overdue at 1 period past). No prolonged absences signaling new losses. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout in P49, demand=86), but in-transit=1322 units (covers 10-15+ periods at ~90-110 avg demand); recent stockouts (P47-49: lost sales 137+67+86=290) due to arrival gaps, but massive pipeline suggests imminent coverage without new orders. Demand analysis: Recent P46-49: 148,137,67,86 (avg~110, volatile); longer-term avg ~90-100 (stable, no regime shift or seasonality evident, chips(Regular) non-perishable steady demand). OR recommendation: 0 units (appropriate as pipeline >> base_stock ~270-400 for L=2, mu~90, sigma~40, q=0.5 z~0; cap irrelevant at 0). Strategy: Follow OR=0 - no override needed; adding orders risks excess holding (1322 pipeline + new order) costing $1/unit/period matching profit, especially with loss risk diluting effective supply but still ample total; prioritize awaiting pipeline depletion post-recent arrivals.",
