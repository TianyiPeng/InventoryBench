Promised LT=2, but actual mixed; order in P48 likely arrives P50 (LT=2) or P51 (LT=3, post-end). Inventory analysis: On-hand=44 critically low vs recent demand avg ~133 (P45-47:114,148,137) or broader P42-47 ~94 (volatile sd~45, lows P43-44 then highs); will likely stockout P48 (sell 44/expected 120+). In-transit=1914 heavily inflated by ghosts (~1600-1800 lost per carry-over history, ~85% fake pipeline), real pipeline ~200-300 units expected sporadically. Total periods left=3 (48-50), expected demand ~330-400 (110-133 avg/period). OR recommendation=0 ignores ghosts/losses and uses promised LT=2/historical demand (~100 avg), overestimating pipeline vs reality. Demand outlook: Volatile recent (P41=184 high, P43-44 lows ~50, P46-47 highs ~140), no sustained shift but upward bias last 3 periods (+25% vs long-term ~105); chips regular, no dates/seasonality provided. Strategy: Override OR's 0 with 150 units (standard recent order size matching recent deliveries/upper demand band) to cover immediate stockout risk and P49-50 demand; LT=2 arrives P50 useful, minimal end holding if LT=3 (lost anyway common). Ensures coverage without excess given unreliable pipeline.",

Strategy: Override OR's 0 with 150 units - covers ~1.5 periods expected demand (~100/period) over LT+1=3-4; consistent with recent orders/deliveries; builds buffer vs losses without excess holding (q=0.8 favors availability); if P46 arrives real, total ~150 on-hand post-P49 covers multiple periods.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT stabilized at 2-3 periods (e.g., P40 LT=3 to P43, P42 LT=3 to P45, P43 LT=2 to P45), but no arrivals in P46-P49 confirms ongoing losses (P44 LT=2/3 expected P46/P47, P45 LT=2 expected P47, P46 LT=2/3 expected P48/P49 all absent).
