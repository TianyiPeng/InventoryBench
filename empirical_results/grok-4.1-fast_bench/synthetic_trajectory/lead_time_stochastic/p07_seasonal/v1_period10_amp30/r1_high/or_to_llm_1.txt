Inventory analysis: On-hand=41 (low, risks stockout if demand>41 as in P48=45); effective pipeline=0 (lost shipments confirmed up to P37, P42 etc.). Demand analysis: All-history avg ~95; recent 10P (P39-48) avg 83; last 5P (P44-48:70,63,88,63,45) avg 66 but high variance/fluctuating (88 high), no sustained lower regime vs prior 83 avg (P37-44). No calendar/product seasonality cues. OR recommendation: 0 units - likely assumes full pipeline coverage using promised L=2 and all-history demand, ignores lost shipments/actual LT.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals last in P45 (P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2); no arrivals P46-P49 despite orders P44-P48 overdue past LT=3, confirming continued losses (P44:250, P46:250, P47:250, P48:250 likely lost); P49:200 pending but pattern suggests high loss risk; effective pipeline=0 sustained (3093 in-transit all lost per carry-over trend). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P50; no expected arrivals in P50 (recent pattern); risk of stockout P50. Demand analysis: Full history volatile (40-159); recent P40-49 avg=81.5 (67,94,129,118,70,63,88,63,45,78), stable fluctuation around 80-90 vs early ~110; no seasonality/dates provided, chips(Regular) generic steady demand. OR recommendation: 0 units - uses promised LT=2, all history, ignores losses/highlights pipeline covers base stock (~82*(3) + safety ~300?), but ineffective here. Strategy: Override OR to 250 units - targets ~3 periods coverage (82*3=246) for LT=2-3 buffer; low holding cost (1 vs profit 19) favors replenishment over stockout risk; consistent with prior overrides during zero-pipeline periods.",
