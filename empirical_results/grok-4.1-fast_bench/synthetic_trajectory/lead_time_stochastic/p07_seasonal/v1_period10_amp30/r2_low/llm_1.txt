(e) Final order logic: Order 130 to replenish pipeline for LT~2 (covers 2-3 future periods ~260u), buffer lost risk, match recent high demand avg 126; avoids excess holding given pipeline but prevents depletion over 25 periods left (pipeline ~1012u covers ~8 periods, need sustained inflow).",

{
  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates or specific product seasonality for regular chips; demand historically volatile around 80-150 but recent shift to low. (b) Demand low regime resumed P45-P48: 84/73/63/51 (avg 67.8, -36% vs prior high P40-P44 avg113), sustained 4 periods with clear declining trend (drop ~11/period), volatility low; forecast P49 ~45-55. (c) LT stable ~2-3 periods (last confirmed LT3 P42\u2192P45/P41\u2192P44, LT2 P43\u2192P45); no arrivals P46-P48 (arrived=0), consistent with sustained lost orders pattern (e.g., P44 120 confirmed lost); in-transit inflated by ghosts. (d) On-hand critically low at 9 (risk stockout P49, expected lost sales ~40); in-transit 1505 likely mostly lost/phantom per history (no recent arrivals despite pipeline), effective coverage minimal beyond immediate; total periods ~50, so P49/P50 final. (e) Endgame: order in P49 arrives P51+ (post-end), cannot contribute sales; adding units risks pure holding loss if miraculously arrive late; order 0 to deplete/avoid excess.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates provided; chips(Regular) is a staple snack with no strong seasonal drivers evident from history or world knowledge (steady but volatile demand). (b) Demand highly volatile; low regime P45-P48 avg68 (84/73/63/51, declining ~11/period), disrupted by P49=85 (single uptick, not sustained 3+ periods for regime shift per criteria); recent 5p avg71, 10p avg92; long-term shifts noted in carry-over but current forecast ~80/period conservative blend. (c) LT varies 1-3 recently (e.g., P42\u2192P45=3, P43\u2192P45=2, P41\u2192P44=3); no arrivals P46-P49 confirms sustained lost order pattern (P44 120 lost overdue>2); many prior losses (e.g., P37, P30 etc.) balloon in-transit. (d) On-hand=0 exposes P50 stockout; in-transit=1505 unreliable/phantom (lost shipments persist indefinitely, no recent arrivals expected P50/P51 given recent orders=0 and LT pattern). (e) Order 100: targets ~1.25 periods demand (~80/period) upon expected arrival P52 (LT2) or P53 (LT3), buffers volatility/lost risk; balances stockout loss (profit=1) vs holding=1 without excess vs recent lows.",
