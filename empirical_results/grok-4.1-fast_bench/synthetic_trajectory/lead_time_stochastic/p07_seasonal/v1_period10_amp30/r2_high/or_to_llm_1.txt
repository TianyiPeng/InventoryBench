Demand analysis: Post-surge drop sustained/extended P44-P48 avg 72 (90,84,73,63,51) vs P40-P43 avg 119 (-40%); recent trend downward to ~50-90/period. No calendar/product seasonality (generic periods/chips). OR recommends 0 (base-stock covered by pipeline under promised L=2); aligns well since OR overestimates pipeline (ignores lost) but even adjusted ~350u covers remaining 2 periods (exp demand ~150 + safety ~100-200, q=0.95 favors coverage). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - avoid adding to pipeline/holding risk in final periods; rely on pending arrivals for P49-P50 demands.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: LT pattern stable at 1-3 periods per carry-over (5+ observations); no new LT data in P49 conclude (arrived=0).

Recent demand P44-P49: 90,84,73,63,51,85 (avg 74, sustained drop -38% vs prior surge avg119 P40-43). No calendar/dates for seasonality; chips(Regular) shows cyclical surges/drops. OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2 + full history (diluted by low recent); aligns with high pipeline vs low demand outlook. New loss: P46 200u overdue past LT=3.
