OR recommendation: 0 units (appropriate given high on-hand and its historical mean/std calc assuming LT=2/i.i.d.); no override needed as 277 buffers P49-P50 (last periods?), minimizes holding cost ($1/unit/period) while q=0.8 fractile satisfied; losses justify caution but no immediate stockout risk.
