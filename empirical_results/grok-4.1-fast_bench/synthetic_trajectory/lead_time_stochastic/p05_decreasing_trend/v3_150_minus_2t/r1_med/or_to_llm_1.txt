{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Actual lead time varies (1-3 periods observed in recent concludes, e.g., P43: P40 order LT=3; P40: P39 LT=1; P37: P35 LT=2, P36 LT=1), promised 2 but frequently lost shipments (carry-over confirms P45/46 lost at P48, pattern persists with no arrivals P44-49 despite in-transit). No new LT confirms from P49 conclude (arrived=0, expected from overdue prior orders unlikely). Treat pipeline as unreliable junk (1146 units accumulated from lost orders like P33, P40 overdue, etc.). Inventory: on-hand=0 entering P50, no expected arrivals P50 (recent orders P47-49=0, prior in-transit junk). Demand analysis: Sustained deep dip P37-49 avg 62.5 (sum 813/13 periods) vs early P1-16 ~135 (-54%), volatile but low (recent P46-49: 48,79,29,91 avg~62); no rebound signal (P49=91 offset by P48=29). OR recommends 0 (assumes reliable pipeline covering base stock, uses full history mean ~110-130 diluted by early high demand, promised LT=2). Strategy: Override OR ignoring junk pipeline (effective pipeline~0); target base stock for LT=3 (review+lead+current=4 periods) at ~65/period expected =260, with safety for volatility; cap conservatively at 200 to avoid excess hold while covering ~3 periods demand post-stockouts (recent 12+ periods frequent stockouts P45-49). Order 200 ensures coverage without overstock given low demand regime.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 200 units - in-transit 1146 is junk from persistent lost shipments (e.g., P45/46 confirmed lost), on-hand 0 risks stockout; recent P37-49 demand avg 62.5/period requires ~200 to cover LT=3 + current amid sustained -54% dip.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Recent demand stable low extended: P37-49 avg 62.5 vs P1-36 avg ~115 (-46%), sustained over 13 periods confirming no rebound despite volatility.",
