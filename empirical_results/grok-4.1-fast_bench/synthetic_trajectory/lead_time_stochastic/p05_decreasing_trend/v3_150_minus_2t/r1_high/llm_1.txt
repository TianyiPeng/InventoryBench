  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates or specific product seasonality provided; chips(Regular) is staple snack with no strong seasonal drivers evident. (b) Demand regime sub-low sustained P36-49 avg 64 (14 periods, -38% vs P1-16 avg 133); recent P44-49 avg 63 (6 periods), stable low with samples 79/55/48/79/29/91\u2014no rebound signal. Early history P1-5 avg ~130 irrelevant now. Forecast ~65/period. (c) Lead time inference: no arrivals P41-49 (9 periods) despite orders; recent confirmed LT varied 1-2 (e.g., P39 arr P40 LT1), but prolonged absence confirms extreme lost shipments (P33+ many 100-400u lost); promised LT=2 irrelevant. No new LT arrivals to update. (d) On-hand=0 (stockout risk immediate); in-transit=2970 massive backlog (growing +100 P49 order, vs prior ~2000-2870), but 9p no arrivals signals all phantom/lost\u2014no expected inflows P50-P52+. Pipeline useless for coverage. (e) Order logic: Cover ~65 demand \xd7 (LT=3 conservative +1 buffer)=260u, but scale to recent order sizing (100-200) given loss risk; order 100 balances low forecast/service vs avoiding further backlog bloat/phantom accumulation. Avoid 0 (recent 7p stockouts lost ~450 sales*$19=$8500).",
