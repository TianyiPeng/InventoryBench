{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variable LT (1-3) with frequent losses/delays, especially even-period orders (P50 even, high risk); no arrivals P46-P49 despite IT=1013 confirms ongoing systemic delays/losses bloating pipeline (carry-over P49). Inventory analysis: On-hand=28 (covers ~1 period at recent avg~25 demand), IT=1013 (total position=1041, excessive even with losses). Demand analysis: Stable very low P44-P49 avg~23 (7,40,25,16 P46-P49; consistent with prior downward shifts P43-P46 avg25, no new drop); historical initial ~180 dropped to ~25 (-86% sustained). OR rec=0 uses historical demand (low mu now) + promised LT, correctly signals no order needed (base-stock low due to low mu, high pipeline). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - on-hand covers P50 demand, high IT buffers future despite unreliability; avoid even-period order to mitigate loss risk; holding cost low priority vs lost sales risk but demand too low to justify ordering.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - demand stable very low (~23/period P44-P49), on-hand 28 covers immediate needs, massive IT=1013 buffers despite delays/losses; P50 even-period avoids high loss risk.",
