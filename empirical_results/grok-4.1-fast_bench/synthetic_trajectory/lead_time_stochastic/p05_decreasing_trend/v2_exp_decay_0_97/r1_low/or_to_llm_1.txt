{

Inventory: On-hand=214 (high for low demand, covers ~7 periods at 30/period); in-transit=1725 dominated by ghosts (prior losses total ~1525+ like P37(100), total ghosts ~1725), true pipeline=0 (no pending orders post-P43).

OR rec=0 uses full history (diluted by early ~170 avg), but aligns perfectly with reality.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: No new arrivals in recent periods (P46-P49 show arrived=0); true pipeline remains at 0 as all in-transit 1725 are confirmed ghosts from prior losses (no orders placed since P43, all arrived by P45). Recent LT history mixed/shorter (last confirmed <=3), but irrelevant without new orders. Inventory & pipeline: OH=189 (from P49 end), true IP=0, total position=189 units covering ~7+ periods at recent demand rate (~25/period), minimizing holding costs (profit=holding=1, q=0.5 critical fractile favors low stock). Demand analysis: Sustained deep low volatile regime confirmed, recent P45-49 demands (45,16,7,40,25) avg=26.6 (std~14.8), consistent with P48 insight (P45-48 avg27, -51% vs prior ~55); no regime shift or seasonality (no dates/product cues). OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history (ignores losses, recent low demand weighting); aligns perfectly with high coverage, low demand outlook, and risk of further ghosts/losses (~40% historical rate). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - no need to order given excess coverage for (L+1)~3 periods low demand (~80 total), avoids adding to ghosts/holding; monitor for demand rebound but evidence shows sustained decline.",
