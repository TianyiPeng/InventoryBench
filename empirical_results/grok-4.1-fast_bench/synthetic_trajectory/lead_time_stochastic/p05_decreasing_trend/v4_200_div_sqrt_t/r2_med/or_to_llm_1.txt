In-transit 1037 units presumed mostly lost given prolonged no-arrival streaks (e.g., 8 periods P24-P31, 6 periods P38-P43) and no recent deliveries matching expected timings. Inventory analysis: On-hand=5 critically low vs recent demand avg ~31 (P42-48: 12,42,1,63,43,25,33; volatile but low regime sustained per carry-over P36-44 avg25.6 extended). P48 conclude shows arrived=0, ending on-hand=5, likely stockout ~25-35 units this period. Demand analysis: Low volatile regime confirmed (P36-48 avg ~29), no sustained uptick despite P45=63 outlier; historical initial high (P1-3 avg151) long gone, current ~30/period. OR recommendation: 0 units - reasonable under its assumptions (promised LT=2, full history equal weight including early high demand?, high pipeline), but ignores systemic losses and phantom pipeline, leading to under-ordering. Strategy: Override OR's 0 with small 50 units - matches sizes that occasionally succeed recently (e.g., P42=50 LT3 P45, P43=50 LT2 P45, P41=70 LT3 P44); targets coverage for 1-2 periods (~30-60) assuming possible LT=2-3 arrival P51-P52, minimizing addition to lost pile while addressing immediate stockout risk.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows high variability and losses (e.g., recent no arrivals in P46-P49 concludes, extending loss streak to 4 periods post-P45; patterns indicate even periods like P50 (\u22612 mod4) prone to loss, recent small orders LT=2-3 when delivered but frequent non-arrivals). Pipeline: In-transit=1087 units accumulated over years of losses (systemic high loss rate confirmed in carry-over, no deliveries since P45 despite orders); treat as effectively 0 reliable inventory. Inventory status: On-hand=0, recent stockouts (e.g., P49: demand=49 sold=5; P48 demand=33 sold=33 from low start). Demand analysis: Sustained low regime P36+ avg~30, recent P46-49: 43,25,33,49 avg=37.5 (volatile but stable low, no sustained uptick); early history high (150+) but irrelevant now. No calendar/dates for seasonality, chips(Regular) steady low demand. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock sees high pipeline/in-transit, uses promised LT=2 and full historical mean~100? but low recent skews it down; ignores losses/patterns). Adjustment strategy: Override OR's 0 upwards to 50 units - matches recent demand avg 37.5, covers 1-2 periods despite LT/loss risk (critical fractile ~0.8 favors stocking vs holding cost); small order aligns with occasional recent successes (e.g., 50u LT=1-3), avoids over-ordering into loss pattern while preventing stockouts (recent lost sales ~40/period value $160).
