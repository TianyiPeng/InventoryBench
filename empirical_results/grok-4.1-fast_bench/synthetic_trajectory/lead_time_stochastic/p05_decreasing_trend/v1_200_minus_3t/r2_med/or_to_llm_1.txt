Inventory analysis: On-hand=195 covers ~2 periods at recent demand avg ~90u/period (P27-P45 avg ~89u).

Recent arrivals (P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2) suggest possible weakening of total loss but older pipeline still ineffective.

Remaining 5 periods (46-50) expected demand ~450u total; current 195u covers P46-P47 partially, risk stockouts P48-50. OR recommendation=0 due to naive high inventory position (ignores losses), using full history mean ~140u? but capped low. Strategy: Override OR upwards conservatively to 150u - matches recent successful small orders (P42:150 arrived), targets base-stock ~4*90=360u over LT+1=4 minus effective IP~195u, but scaled down for loss risk, end-game holding tolerance, and cap-like smoothing.
