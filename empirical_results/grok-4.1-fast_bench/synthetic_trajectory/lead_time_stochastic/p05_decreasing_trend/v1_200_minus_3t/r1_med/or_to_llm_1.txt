{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent carry-over confirms LT stabilized at 2 periods earlier (e.g., P26\u219228 LT=2, P27\u219229 LT=2, P34\u219236 LT=2, P35\u219237 LT=2), but losses resumed (P44 & P45 confirmed lost by P47/P48 concludes; no arrivals P46-49 despite outstanding orders; P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2 in P45). In-transit 1859 entirely phantom/lost (consistent with Period 42 insight of 1359 phantom + subsequent losses like P44/250, P45/250; no arrivals reducing balance since P45). Effective pipeline=0. Demand analysis: Sustained low regime per carry-over (P44-48 avg 65, now P45-49: 60+61+64+75+54=314/5=62.8, -65% from early avg 178; variability persists with spikes to 75-111). No calendar/product seasonality cues. Inventory: On-hand 186 covers ~3 periods at 63 demand (186/63\u22483), but LT=2-3 + post-decision demand requires coverage for 3-4 periods (~190-250 total); risk stockout if no order amid losses. OR recommendation: 0 units (assumes real pipeline + all-history demand, underestimates low regime/phantom); override to rebuild pipeline. Strategy: Order 100 units (conservative ~1.5 periods demand + safety; targets base stock ~250 for mu_hat=3*65=195 + z*sigma ~0.8 fractile safety; avoids overstock given holding cost).",
