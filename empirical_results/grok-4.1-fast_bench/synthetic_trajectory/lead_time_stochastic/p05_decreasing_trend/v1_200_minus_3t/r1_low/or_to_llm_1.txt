Inventory analysis: On-hand=66 covers ~1 period of recent demand (~64 avg P43-48); in-transit=1514 largely ghost inventory from confirmed lost shipments (cumulative ~1434+ per carry-over, implying actual pipeline ~0); no arrivals expected in P49 (P46/P47/P48 orders=0 for LT=3/2/1). Demand analysis: Low regime sustained avg~64 P43-48 (63/61/60/61/64/75) vs prior ~175 (-63%), stable recent with low variance; chips(Regular) no calendar spikes evident. OR recommendation: 0 units, valid under its assumption of high real pipeline but ignores losses/ghost inventory. Strategy: Override OR to order 100 units (recent successful order size), targeting coverage for 1-2 periods post-P49 (~64*2=128 minus residual ~0) assuming avg LT=2; balances stockout risk (ongoing pattern) against high holding cost and softening demand trend; total IP post-order ~166 for ~3 periods demand (~192).",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Historical pattern sustained at 1-3 periods (e.g., recent: P49 conclude shows no arrivals, consistent with prior; losses confirmed for older orders like P37+). No new LT data in P49 conclude. Inventory analysis: On-hand=12 (critically low, will stockout on ~60 demand). In-transit=1614 almost entirely lost shipments (carry-over total ~1434 by P41 + subsequent like P49's 100 pending but pattern suggests high loss risk; actual pipeline near 0). Demand analysis: Low regime sustained (P43-49 avg~62: 63/61/60/61/64/75/54; vs prior ~175, -65%; recent P46-49 avg~63 confirming softening). No calendar/product seasonality (generic periods). OR recommendation: 0 units (over-relies on inflated in-transit/pipeline, ignores losses/low actual inv; uses promised LT=2 and full history mean~175). Strategy: Override OR to order 100 units (matches recent low demand mean, covers 1-2 periods with buffer for LT/loss risk; aligns with prior successful low-volume orders like P49=100; avoids excess holding given profit=holding=1 and stockout risk high). Expected: Covers P50+ demand ~60/period x (L+1)=~180 but scaled down for confirmed low mu and loss-adjusted pipeline.",
