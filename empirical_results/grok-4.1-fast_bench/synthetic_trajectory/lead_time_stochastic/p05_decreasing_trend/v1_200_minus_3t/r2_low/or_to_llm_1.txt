Effective arrivals P48 possible: P47 order=75 (LT=1), P46=100 (LT=2), total ~175 expected with ~80% arrival prob based on patterns (recent LT up to 3 no losses).

Inventory: on-hand=0 entering P48; expected P48 on-hand post-arrival pre-demand ~100-175, sufficient for ~70 demand but risk if low arrivals.

Adjustment: OR overestimates pipeline by counting lost shipments; true expected supply ~175 <210 demand, shortfall ~35-50; order 70 adds safety for demand var/loss risk (sigma~30 recent), variability, end-game (P50 end, LT=1 arrives P49, LT=2 P50, LT=3 wasted); p=h=1 so q=0.5 z~0, minimal safety but add for uncertainty.
