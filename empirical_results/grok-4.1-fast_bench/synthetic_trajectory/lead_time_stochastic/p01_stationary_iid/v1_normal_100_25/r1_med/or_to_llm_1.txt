{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2; observed recent LT variable (1-3 periods when arriving), but no-arrival streak P46-P49 concludes (4 consecutive zeros), confirming resumed supplier unreliability after prior recovery (P30-P37 arrivals). No new LT conclusions in P49. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0; in-transit=1511 bloated by suspected lost shipments (carry-over history: ~1000+ units lost/pending loss like P46+ orders); effective pipeline near-zero as recent deliveries sporadic/none. Demand analysis: Historical mean ~99 (P1-P46 avg); recent P47-P49: 127/83/135 avg=115 (+16%), volatile with spikes but no sustained regime shift yet (low regime P41-44 ended). OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock subtracts full 1511 pipeline > base ~300 for L=2, mean99), ignores losses/unreliability. Adjustment strategy: Override to 140 units (matches recent successful delivery sizes 130-140, ~1.2x recent mean demand) to rebuild effective pipeline for (LT+1)=3 periods ahead (~345 demand), avoiding future stockouts despite bloated in-transit; conservative given stockout risk this period (likely no P50 arrival).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 140 units - in-transit 1511 bloated by ~1000+ suspected lost shipments (4-period no-arrival streak P46-P49), effective pipeline low; recent demand avg 115 requires replenishment for LT~2 + review period.",
  "carry_over_insight": "No-arrival streak extended to P46-P49 (4 consecutive zero arrivals), further confirming resumed supplier unreliability (exceeds prior 3-period threshold).",
