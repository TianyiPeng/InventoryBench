Carry-over confirms recent P38-P43 reliable but notes potential P37/P40 issues resolved. Pipeline reconciliation: In-transit=1632 bloated by confirmed lost ~1182+ (carry-over) plus new overdues - P44 order (150, placed P44 expected P47 LT3, absent P47/P48 concludes), P45 order (150, placed P45 expected P48 LT3, absent P48) likely lost; effective pipeline ~150 (P48 order pending, possible LT=1 arrival during P49 before demand). On-hand=0 post P48 stockout (124 lost sales). Demand analysis: Recent 10 periods (P39-P48) avg=110, std~55 (volatile: low 11, highs 182/149/143); stable snack demand, no calendar/seasonal cues. OR recommendation: 0 units - reasonable under full pipeline assumption (promised L=2, all-history mean ~100, base-stock exceeded by raw 1632) but ignores losses/overdues, understates risk. Strategy: Override to 150 units - covers ~1.5 periods demand (P49 + partial P50) assuming possible P48 arrival LT=1; aligns with recent order sizes (120-150), OR cap ~150 adjusted for effective pipeline ~150; prioritizes avoiding stockouts (P47 lost 32, P48 124) near end (P49/50), low holding risk vs $4 profit/unit; order may arrive P50 if LT=1.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Observed LTs remain 1-3 periods (e.g., P40 order arrived P43 LT=3, P42-P43 LT=3/2); no new confirms in P49 (arrived=0), but pattern consistent with carry-over max LT=3. Pipeline: In-transit=1782 includes confirmed lost (~1482+ from carry-over P15/17/19/24/25/29/30/37/44/45 etc.), effective reliable pipeline ~300 units (recent undelivered post-P46 streak, e.g., P48/P49 orders 150 each potentially arriving LT1-3). Inventory: On-hand=0, recent stockouts (P48:124 unsold, P49:38 unsold), risking loss of ~$450+ profit. Demand analysis: Recent 10 periods (P40-49) avg=113 (1126/10), volatile (11-182), no seasonality/dates; early history irrelevant now. OR rec=0 assumes full pipeline delivery (ignores losses), underorders vs reality. Strategy: Override to 150 units (historical safe qty, covers ~1.3x recent avg for LT+1=4 periods coverage post-discount, balances stockout risk vs holding; aligns with prior overrides during loss streaks).",
