Demand stable ~90-110 (historical ~106, recent similar, no regime shift/seasonality as no dates/product calendar cues). OR rec 0 aligns: uses promised LT=2/all history but overestimates pipeline (ignores losses), yet raw position high even adjusted; base stock ~3*100=300 (q=0.5 z=0), but effective ~309 covers 3 periods. Strategy: Follow OR 0 - final P49/50, order arrives P50+ (LT>=1), risks adding lost/holding on end inv post-P50 w/o certain sales benefit; prioritize avoid overstock vs minor P49 stockout risk (89 covers ~89% demand).",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Actual LT varies 1-3 periods based on concluded arrivals (e.g., P42 LT=3 arrived P45, P43 LT=2 P45, P40 LT=3 P43, P46 order LT>=4 as no arrival in P49 conclude despite max observed LT=3); sporadic losses sustained historically (P33 lost, prior confirmed), recent arrivals reliable until P46 overdue. No new sustained LT shift beyond 1-3 variation. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 after P49 stockout (demand=112 > starting 89); in-transit=1194 includes risky old/pending orders (P46 220 overdue LT>=4, recent P46-49 concludes arrived=0 indicating poor near-term pipeline delivery); effective reliable pipeline near 0. Demand analysis: Stable regime ~95-110/period, recent 10-period avg P40-49=(82+61+97+102+108+91+102+89+105+112)/10=94.9, long-term ~100; no calendar/seasonality signals. OR recommendation: 0 units (assumes promised LT=2, full historical demand, high pipeline covers base stock ~300 + safety); ignores losses/delays/overdues. Adjustment strategy: Override OR's 0 with 250 units - covers ~2.5 periods demand (250/100) accounting for LT=2-3 +1 buffer for stockout risk and pipeline unreliability; balances profit vs holding at q=0.5 (base ~300), but caps below uncapped to avoid overstock if overdue arrives late. Ensures coverage until confirmed arrivals.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 250 units - on-hand at 0 after P49 stockout (23 lost sales), recent pipeline failed to deliver (P46-49 arrived=0, P46 overdue LT>=4), despite 1194 in-transit; need buffer for ~100 avg demand over LT=2-3 amid loss risk.",
  "carry_over_insight": "P46 order (220 units) LT>=4 (no arrival by P49 conclude > observed max LT=3); emerging sporadic loss reinforcing historical pattern post-P45 reliable note.",
