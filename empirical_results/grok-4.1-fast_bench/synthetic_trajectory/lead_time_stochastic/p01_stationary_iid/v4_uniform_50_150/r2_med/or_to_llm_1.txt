Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised L=2, but history shows frequent LT=1-3+ with losses/delays (carry-over confirms multiple lost shipments like P37, P44/P45 currently overdue LT=6+/5+ by P49 conclude; recent dry spell P46-P49 no arrivals despite pending orders). No new concluded arrivals in P49, extending pattern. Pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=1795 units (includes recent P44:250 LT=6+, P45:200 LT=5+, P48:250 at promised L=2 for P50 arrival, plus older pending/likely lost). Even assuming high historical loss rate (~50%+ from prior dry spells), effective pipeline covers 10+ periods at ~90 demand/period. Demand analysis: Recent P46-49: 64,51,107,91 (avg~78); longer-term ~80-100 stable, no calendar/seasonality cues. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock capped; uses promised L=2, all history mu_bar~90?, pipeline overwhelms base_stock~300-400). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - massive pipeline buffers against losses/delays/stockouts better than adding to backlog (holding $1/unit/period); monitor P50 conclude for P48 arrival to assess if dry spell continues.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - 1795 in-transit covers 20+ periods even with 50% historical loss rate, outweighing recent 4-period dry spell risk and avoiding excess holding costs.",
  "carry_over_insight": "No arrivals P46-P49 (4 consecutive periods); extends dry spell with P44(250) overdue LT=6+, P45(200) LT=5+ (reinforces frequent losses but not new sustained shift beyond prior insights).",
