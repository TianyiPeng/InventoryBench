{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variability LT=1-3 confirmed (e.g., P40 LT=3 arr P43, P41 LT=3 arr P44, P43 LT=2 arr P45, P34 LT=2 arr P36, P35 LT=2 arr P37, P38 LT=1 arr P39, P39 LT=1 arr P40); predominant LT=1-2 but LT=3 still occurs; P46 order (90 units) overdue past LT=3 (expected arr P49, but P49 conclude arrived=0), potential new loss after long no-loss streak since P33. Inventory: On-hand=0 (stockouts P47-P49: demands 87+90+67 unsold); in-transit=1224 likely inflated by ghosts (historical ~1044+ at P33, no major arrivals since P45's 80 units). Demand analysis: Low regime sustained P16-49 avg~81 (e.g., P40-49: 99,79,86,55,75,48,119,87,90,67 avg 80.5, -44% vs early ~144); recent P46-49 avg~91 within variance, no reversal; chips(Regular) no calendar/product seasonality signals (generic periods). OR rec=0 valid under promised L=2/all-history mu~140 (base-stock ~420 <<1224 pipeline), but ignores low-demand regime, ghosts, recent stockouts. Strategy: Override to 90 (recent demand avg), covering ~1-2 periods expected demand (L~2); avoids excess amid ghosts/overdues but replenishes stockouts; aligns q=0.5 (indifferent stockout/hold).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 0 to 90 units - low demand regime (~81/period sustained 34 periods) with recent stockouts (P47-49 demands 87+90+67) requires modest replenishment despite high ghost in-transit (1224) and P46 order overdue.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Low demand regime extended P16-49 avg 81 vs prior ~144 (-44%, sustained 34 periods); P46 order (90 units) overdue past LT=3 (no P49 arrival), potential first loss since P33 after 16-period streak",
