OR recommendation: 0 units, valid under high pipeline assumption but ignores losses; base-stock likely low due to recent low demand mean \u03bc\u0304~110-120 over all history but capped at low qty. Strategy: Override to 90 units - matches recent small-order success for delivery (5+ obs LT=1-3 since P31 per P41 insight), covers 1-2 periods low demand (~80*1.1 buffer), minimizes holding risk ($1/u/p) vs stockout loss ($4p); ensures coverage post-stockout while testing LT for this size; total pipeline post-order ~1844 but low qty limits new loss exposure.",
