{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised L=2, but sustained variability 1-3 periods confirmed from history (e.g., recent P40 lt=3 arr P43, P41 lt=3 arr P44, P42 lt=3 arr P45, P43 lt=2 arr P45; occasional lt=1 like P39 arr P40); losses sustained with P44 (100 units) confirmed lost (absent P47 conclude), total lost ~1179 units bloating in-transit to 1299 (mostly irrecoverable). No new arrivals in P48 conclude (expected none as P45/46/47 orders=0). For P49, potential arrival only if P48 order (120) has lt=1. Inventory analysis: On-hand=6 critically low (will likely stockout ~84 of expected ~90 demand in P49); effective pipeline low (~120 if lt=1 for P48, else 0 new; prior mostly lost). Demand analysis: Volatile phase sustained P34-48 (15 periods, avg~79, range 35-119); recent P46-48 avg 99 (119,87,90) at high end but within volatility (no sustained shift >3 periods); historical early ~140 dropped to ~70 (P16-23), rebounded ~94 (P24-33), now volatile ~78-99. No calendar/dates for seasonality. OR recommendation: 0 units, based on promised L=2 + full history mean (pulled down by drop), ignores losses/overestimates pipeline. Strategy: Override OR upwards to 120 units (matching recent high-end demand avg 99, covers expected 80-100 for P49/P50 + buffer for lt=1-3 variability; endgame P49/50 minimizes holding risk as order arrives P50-52 but supports sales in last periods; avoids stockouts given effective low inventory).",

{
