  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variability persists (e.g., P41 LT=3 in P44, P42 LT=3/P43 LT=2 in P45); no arrivals in P46-P48 concludes despite expected from recent orders (P47 order LT>=2, P48 LT>=1, atop older ghosts like P19=180, P29=120), confirming carry-over lost shipment pattern with no new sustained LT shift. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P49 (stockout risk immediate); in-transit=1304 massively inflated by historical ghosts (cumulative lost >1000 based on carry-over e.g. P2=204, P6=180, P19=180, P29=120, P33 etc.), effective reliable pipeline low as evidenced by recent no-arrivals P46-48 and stockouts (P48 sold=0/90, P43=0/55, P42=0/86, P41=0/79). Demand analysis: Sustained low regime P34-48 avg~79 (P42-48 recent avg~80: 86/55/75/48/119/87/90), -42% vs early ~135, consistent no regime reversal; chips(Regular) generic no calendar spikes (no dates provided). OR recommendation: 0 units, logical under promised L=2/i.i.d. assumptions with huge pipeline/on-hand history, but overstates effective pipeline due to unmodeled losses. Strategy: Override OR 0 to order 100 matching recent demand avg~80-90, hedging persistent losses/stockouts without bloating ghost pipeline further; covers ~1-2 periods low demand given LT~2 uncertainty, minimizing lost sales (profit $4) vs holding risk ($1/period) near end (P49/50). Expected base stock low regime ~80*(1+2)=240 + safety, but cap order small vs unreliable 1304 pipeline.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: From history, recent arrivals sparse - P45 had 200 units (P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2), P44 had 100 (P41 LT=3), but no arrivals in P46-P49 (4 consecutive periods) despite orders in P44-P49; this strengthens prior lost shipment pattern (e.g., P47 LT>=3, P48>=2, P49>=1, atop ghosts like P2=204, P6=180, P19=180, P29=120, P33=120). Actual LT variable (1-3 observed recently), but high loss risk means unreliable pipeline. Inventory: On-hand=0 (stockouts in P48-49, sold=0 vs demand 90/67); in-transit=1404 severely inflated by cumulative lost orders (historical ghosts total >1000 units), so actual incoming supply minimal/uncertain. Demand analysis: Sustained low regime P34-49 avg~78 (-42% vs early ~135), 16 periods; recent P46-49 avg~91 (119,87,90,67) volatile but within low band, no upward shift confirmed (insufficient sustained evidence); expect ~80 for P50. OR recommendation: 0 units, logical under its assumptions (promised LT=2, full history mean, bloated pipeline exceeds base stock), but ignores losses/LT variability/low recent demand adjustment. Final strategy: Override OR to 100 units (modest, matching recent order pattern and low demand mean), to cover ~1-2 periods demand (80-160) over expected LT=2-3 + current period, minimizing stockout risk (recent sales lost ~150 units in P48-49) while avoiding excess holding given loss risk and low demand; aligns with profit=4/holding=1 (q=0.8 favors coverage).",
