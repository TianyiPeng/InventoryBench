Recent arrivals: P45 (P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2); no arrivals P46-P49 confirms losses/overdues. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 after P49 stockout (demand=44, sold=0); P48 partial stockout (demand=72>59); effective coverage low due to phantom in-transit. Demand analysis: Volatile low sustained P41-49 avg ~49 (range 15-74), recent P47-49 avg 63 but P46=15 drop fits volatility; overall decline from early ~110 to ~50 (-55%). OR recommendation 0 ignores losses/actual LT variability, underorders vs. high critical fractile (19/20=0.95).
