Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P49, high risk of stockout this period if no arrival (which occurs after decision); past patterns show frequent stockouts (e.g., P48 demand=48 unsold). Demand analysis: Recent P41-P48 demands (81,31,67,74,32,79,77,48) volatile but avg=61.1 (sustained downward shift from prior ~77 avg P34-P40, aligns with P47 carry-over); no calendar/product seasonality info to adjust further. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock minus bloated pipeline <0, uses promised LT=2 and full history mean ignoring recency/losses). Strategy: Override OR's 0 upwards to 120 - covers ~2 periods of recent demand avg (61*2=122) accounting for LT~2 +1 review period, matching recent order sizes that eventually arrived when not lost; avoids overordering given holding cost=profit=1 and pipeline uncertainty, but ensures replenishment since effective inventory low.",
