(b) Demand regime analysis: Full history avg ~98 (sum 1276/13); recent P10-P13: 72/93/62/125 (avg 88, high volatility sd~28); post-P8 uptrend noted (123/150) but interrupted by lows (72/62), P13 spike 125 (+100% vs P12); volatility sustained per carryover, no new regime shift (mixed signals, not 3+ consistent periods); forecast P14 ~100-120 conservative (recent avg + spike buffer). (c) Lead_time vs missing orders: Confirmed varying 1-3 periods (e.g., P9 LT3 to P12, P10 LT2 to P12); losses P2(100)/P6(120) stuck in-transit indefinitely; no new losses confirmed (P11/12/13 pending); P13 conclude arrived=0 as expected (no due LT1 from prior).

(e) Final order logic: High pipeline/on-hand reduces stockout risk but holding cost $1/unit pressures overstock; order 120 to cover forecast 110 + LT/loss buffer (avg recent order size), ensures (L+1=4 periods) coverage while minimizing excess (projected post-P14 inv high regardless).",
