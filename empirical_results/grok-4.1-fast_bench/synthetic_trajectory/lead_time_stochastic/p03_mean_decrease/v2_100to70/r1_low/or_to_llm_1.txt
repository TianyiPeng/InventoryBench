{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed LT variability persists (1-3 periods), with no recent arrivals in P46-P49 concludes; recent examples include P41\u2192P44 (LT=3), P43\u2192P45 (LT=2), P40\u2192P43 (LT=3), P39\u2192P40 (LT=1), but many overdue (e.g., P44 order expected P47 no-show through P49, confirming lost). In-transit 1155 units bloated with confirmed lost shipments (prior sum 555 at P35 + subsequent like P37(100) + recent P44(100), P45(100), etc.), effective pipeline \u22480 as lost orders remain in-transit indefinitely without arriving. Inventory & demand: On-hand=0 entering P50, guaranteeing stockout this period (demand likely ~70 based on recent 10-period avg 70.3: P40=88,P41=75,P42=66,P43=79,P44=71,P45=54,P46=59,P47=75,P48=91,P49=45); recent stockouts P48(91 lost), P49(45 lost) highlight lost sales risk. OR recommendation=0 ignores lost shipments and actual LT>promised=2, overestimating pipeline coverage. Strategy: Override OR's 0 upwards to 150 units - targets base-stock coverage for (LT=3 +1)=4 periods at recent \u03bc=75 (300 total, but conservative per-period cap adjustment and recent demand dip; 150 covers ~2 periods immediately while monitoring). Ensures profit capture without excessive holding given q=0.5 fractile.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 0 to 150 units - in-transit 1155 ineffective due to persistent lost shipment pattern (recent P44 confirmed lost overdue 3 periods); on-hand=0 and recent demand avg 70 requires coverage for LT\u22483 periods to prevent further stockouts like P48(91 lost)/P49(45 lost).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Period 49: P44 order (100 units) confirmed lost: expected P47 arrival under LT=3, absent P47-P49 concludes (overdue 3 periods), matching prior lost patterns (P2/P6/P15/P19/P24/P37); in-transit now 1155 reflects additional losses.",
