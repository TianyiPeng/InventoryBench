Demand analysis: Last 10 periods (P38-47) avg=64.5 (range 31-81), slightly below overall historical ~80 (early periods higher 60-140); no calendar/seasonality data, stable regime no new shifts; expected remaining 3 periods (48-50) ~70*3=210 units.

Final strategy: Override OR's 0 to 120 units - standard recent order size to hedge stockout risk in P49-P50 given low actual pipeline despite nominal bloat, OH covers P48 only; LT=2-3 means P48 order arrives P50-P51 (useful for P50 if LT=2, no excess holding risk near endgame); balances sales upside (4 profit) vs. low loss probability.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT pattern was 2-3 over P41-43 deliveries (confirmed in P44-P45), but P44 order (120 units, placed Period 44) shows no arrival through P48 conclude (LT=4 overdue), confirming it as lost shipment similar to prior patterns (e.g., P37 lost after LT=4 overdue). Overall, sustained unreliable pipeline with frequent losses; in-transit 1361 severely bloated (>1120 lost per prior + new P44), so discount heavily - actual incoming pipeline near zero short-term. Inventory analysis: On-hand 50 critically low vs recent 10-period demand avg 64 (P39-48: 79,72,81,31,67,74,32,79,77,48), std dev ~20; likely stockout this period (demand >50 probable) and next without new orders, as no reliable arrivals imminent. Demand outlook: Stable no-seasonality (no dates/product details), recent mean 64 lower than long-term ~85 (full history), but high variance requires safety buffer; no regime shift confirmed. OR recommendation: 0 units, correctly caps due to bloated pipeline under promised L=2 assumption, but ignores massive losses/LT variability - must override upward. Strategy: Order 120 to target base-stock for 3-period horizon (actual LT~3 +1) at ~70/period (~210 total), minus unreliable pipeline (~0) + low on-hand; aligns with recent successful order sizes during reliability windows, balances stockout risk (q=0.8 critical fractile favors ~84th percentile coverage).",
