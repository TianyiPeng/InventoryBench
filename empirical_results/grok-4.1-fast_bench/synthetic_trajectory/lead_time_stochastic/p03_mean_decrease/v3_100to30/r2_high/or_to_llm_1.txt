{
  "rationale": "Period 49/50 (penultimate period). On-hand=44, in-transit=1036 bloated by historical losses (~776 prior + recent like P45=100, total ~876+). Recent demand P38-48: avg 34.1 (11 periods), sd~20.1, highly volatile (lows 3-7, highs 41-53). Expected P49 demand ~34, on-hand covers with ~10 left for P50 (risk stockout ~24 units if demand 34, but profit $19 vs holding $1 favors some over/under). Pipeline: Recent LT sustained 2-3 avg 2.75 (last arrivals P40-43 LT3, P41 LT3, P42 LT3, P43 LT2). P48 order=60 LT2\u2192arr P50 possible (covers P50 partially), LT3\u2192P51 post-game. P45 order=100 no arr by P48 conclude (48-45=3 past placement, matches prior lost pattern). P46/P47 orders=0. P49 order LT2-3\u2192arr P51-P52 post-P50, no sales impact (demand after decision, arrivals too late), potential holding penalty if counted in final ending inv but likely irrelevant. OR=0 aligns: high perceived pipeline + historical mean leads to no order needed. No override: order 0 preserves profit, avoids useless late inventory. Demand/calendar: no dates/product specifics for seasonality; volatility > prior regimes, but no new shift warranting order.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT sustained at 2-3 periods (avg 2.75 over last arrivals: P40 LT3, P41 LT3, P42 LT3, P43 LT2, etc.; no new concludes in P49 as expected since P47/P48 orders LT>1). No new lost confirmed (P49 arr=0 consistent with P47=0 LT2/P48=60 LT1 unlikely; monitor P50 conclude for P48 LT2). Inventory analysis: On-hand=31 (low vs exp demand ~34); in-transit=1036 bloated by ~876 cumulative lost (per P49 insight), actual pipeline ~160 but recent arrivals sparse (none P46-49), likely mainly P48=60 (exp P50 LT2 or P51 LT3) + few older. Effective position ~31 + 60-100 low for LT+1=3-4 periods coverage (exp demand 32-35*4=128-140, volatile sd~20). Demand analysis: Volatility sustained P38-49 avg~32 (P38-48 34.1 + P49=13 dip), range 3-53; no regime shift (lows/highs continue). No calendar/dates/seasonality. OR=0 flawed: uses promised L=2 + all-history demand + overstated pipeline (ignores ~876 lost), underestimates need. Strategy: Override OR 0 \u2192 60 units (match recent order sizes P48=60/P46=0 avg; replenish to cover 2 periods volatile demand ~70, buffer stockouts while minimizing hold $1 vs profit $19; position post-order ~91 + incoming covers 3+ periods).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 60 units - on-hand 31 critically low vs ~32-35 exp demand (P38-49 volatile avg), actual pipeline thin (~60-160 exp from P48 etc.) despite bloated 1036 in-transit hiding ~876 lost shipments.",
