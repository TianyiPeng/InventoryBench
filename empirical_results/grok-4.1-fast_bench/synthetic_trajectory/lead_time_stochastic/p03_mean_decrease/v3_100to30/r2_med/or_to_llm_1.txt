Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised L=2, but historical LT variable (1-3 periods), with frequent losses; no arrivals since Period 39 (10 periods ago, P38 order LT=1), confirming recent orders P44(80), P46(80), P47(80), P48(80), P49(80) lost or indefinitely delayed, bloating in-transit to 866 (prior lost ~546 + recent ~400 = ~946); effective pipeline depleted to 0, no imminent arrivals expected in P50-P52. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0, multiple recent stockouts (P46-49 demands 53/7/41/13 unmet), holding cost irrelevant at 0. Demand analysis: Recent P40-49 avg=31.1 (48,3,40,51,7,48,53,7,41,13), volatile (lows<10, highs>50) vs prior P23-37 ~38 (-18%), sustained over 10 periods; chips(Regular) no calendar anchors (generic periods), no seasonality signal. OR recommendation: 0 units, flawed as it uses promised L=2, full historical demand (ignores regime drops), and bloated in-transit (doesn't detect losses), leading to under-ordering. Strategy: Override OR upwards to 100 units - targets base stock for ~3 periods (L+1) at 30-35 mean + safety for volatility/loss risk (~90+10), consistent with prior overrides during stockouts (e.g., P44-49 ordered 80 but lost); avoids over-ordering given low demand regime.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 100 units - no arrivals since P39 (10 periods), recent orders lost bloating in-transit, effective pipeline 0 despite stockouts on volatile ~31 avg demand (P40-49); order covers 3 periods demand + safety.",
  "carry_over_insight": "No arrivals P40-49 (10 periods), all recent orders lost (P44,46-49:80u each, +400u), total lost ~946u, effective pipeline 0; Demand low-volatile sustained P40-49 avg31.1 (-18% vs P23-37 ~38), over 10 periods.",
