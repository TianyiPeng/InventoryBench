Demand analysis: Product is winter knitwear sweater; current date 2019-12-02 (early Dec, Cyber Monday, post-Thanksgiving/Black Friday shopping peak). Historical seasonality per carry-over: fall surge peaked Oct (145 avg P32-35), moderated Nov (55 avg P39-41), but P42 spiked to 168 (+200% vs P39-41), signaling holiday demand renewal. Recent 5-period avg P38-42=85, but skewed by Nov lows; expect Dec ramp-up to 120-180/period given Christmas proximity (P46=12/23 peak week). Periods left: 5 (P43-47); expected demand ~100-150 avg x5=500-750. Current 192 covers ~1.5 periods at 120 avg, risking stockouts P44-47 without order. OR recommendation=81: Likely based on full-history mean ~40-50 (pulled down by summer lows), base_stock~(1+4)*\u03bc + z\u03c3\u221a5 minus position=192, yielding conservative order; ignores seasonality/holiday surge and recent P42 spike. Strategy: Override OR upward to build pipeline for Dec holiday peak; target coverage for 4 periods pre-arrival (~480 at 120 avg) + P47 safety, accounting q=0.5 fractile (profit=holding=1) to limit excess holding over 4 periods. Order 150 balances risk: total position post-order=192+150=342 (~2.8 periods at 120), with upside for spikes.",
