Winter baseline ~260 (early 2019 P1-5 avg 260); forecast P46 spike 500, P47+ moderate 250 with volatility. Last 10p avg 275. (c) Lead time: Stable 4 periods (all arrivals e.g. P44 order none yet, but pattern: P37->P41, P36->P40 etc.); no losses. In-transit 800 = P43:500 (arr P47), P44:300 (arr P48). (d) Inv/pipeline: On-hand 1117 covers P46 spike (1117-500=617 end); P47:617+500=1117-250~867; P48:867+300=1167-250~917; P49:917-250~667; P50:667-250~417; depletes by P52 w/o new order. Total avail ~6wks at 250/wk. (e) Order: 500 to replenish LT demand (4*250=1000) + spike safety (~20% var), top-up pipeline to ~8wks coverage. Low holding ($1 vs $19 profit) favors overstock vs stockout risk; aligns w/ P43=500 post-spike order.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) World/product: Curvy women's denim jeggings (high-waist skinny pants). Seasonal peaks: back-to-school (Sep, as seen P30-33 ~300-400), holidays (Thanksgiving P42=447 spike, Dec build-up). Now 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week): expect sharp post-holiday demand slump (returns, shopping fatigue), similar to post-back-to-school declines (P34-40 avg 283 down -22%). No major event boosting denim demand now.\n(b) Demand regime: Holiday uptrend P43-P46 (154,214,258,193; avg 205, volatile post-P42 spike). Excl spike, recent 4p avg ~205 aligns with carry-over 'post-fall peak decline' ~283 but holiday-adjusted. No rebound to Sep peaks (362); post-Xmas likely drops to pre-holiday lows (~200-234 P39-41) or lower (seasonal winter lull for fashion).\n(c) Lead time: Confirmed 4p consistently (latest P37\u2192P41 etc.). No losses. In-transit 1300: P43@500 (arr P47), P44@300 (P48), P46@500 (P50). No overdue.\n(d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 924 (post-P46=924). +500 (P47) \u2192 ~1424 start after arr, covers ~7p@200d. +300(P48), +500(P50) \u2192 ample pipeline (covers 10p+ demand). High OH risks holding cost ($1/u/p), esp post-holiday low demand.\n(e) Order logic: Forecast next 5p (P47-51) ~180-220d (conservative post-holiday decline from 205 avg). Pipeline+OH covers >>demand (excess ~4000u equiv). Order 0 to minimize holding vs profit imbalance; replenish later if needed.",
