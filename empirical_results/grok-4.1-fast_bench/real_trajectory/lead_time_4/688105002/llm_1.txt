Date 2019/12/30: late winter/end-of-year post-Christmas (P46=12/23), pre-NYE; cold weather suppresses skirt demand, expect low stable winter regime ~50/period as in late fall; no major events driving spikes for this category (NYE party wear possible but minor for denim mini).\n(b) Demand regime: winter low stable confirmed P34-46 excl P42 spike (11/25 near Thanksgiving/Black Friday): P34-41 avg~49 (8p), P43-46 avg~48 (4p), overall ~49/period sustained 13p matching P38 carry-over ~50 stabilization post-fall decline; P46=38, P45=58 recent consistent low; forecast ~45-55/period near-term, low volatility outside one-offs.\n(c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (latest: P40\u2192P44, P37\u2192P41, P43/P46 pending but no losses evidenced); in-transit 280=140(P43\u2192P47)+140(P46\u2192P50), no overdue/missing (all past orders concluded on time).\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: start P47 on-hand=100; +140 arr P47 \u2192~240 post-arr pre-demand; projected ends (at ~50/d): P47~190, P48~140, P49~90, P50~180 (+140 arr), P51~130 (+our order); low point ~90 pre-P50 arr risks minor stockout if spike (>90); total pipeline+onhand covers ~7-8 periods demand.\n(e) Order 200 for P51 arr to replenish post-drawdown, cover ~4 periods demand (200/~50) + safety for spikes (e.g. P42=144), balance holding vs lost sales; matches historical low-demand orders (140s) scaled for gaps/spikes while minimizing excess (profit=holding=1).",
