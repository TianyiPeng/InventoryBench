Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "(a) Product: Women's push-up skinny denim jeggings (casual lower body garment). World/calendar: 2019-12-30 (Mon), post-Christmas (Dec 25), New Year's Eve eve. Post-holiday slump likely with returns/clearance; denim casual wear steady but winter sales may suppress demand vs. fall peaks. Matches early 2019 Jan avg ~82 (historical samples). (b) Demand regimes: Carry-over notes fall rebound (Sep peak 230, Oct plateau ~118). Recent P39-46: avg ~86 (97,92,95,109,44,77,92,75); P43 outlier low (44, post-BF/early Dec lull), P44-46 holiday avg 81. Sustained Dec decline vs. late fall (P39-42 avg 98). Overall recent ~80-90, aligning winter baseline. (c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods (latest P42 order arrived P46; no losses/missing). No in-transit/overdues. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 466 (high, post recent arrivals P43-46 totaling 150+140+130+150=570 added to prior). Covers 5-6 periods at 80-90 demand (L+1=5 periods need ~400-450). Pipeline empty (no orders P43-46). (e) Order logic: High stock buffers demand thru P51+ arrivals; order 0 to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while ensuring service (466 >> forecast). Rebuild only if stock depletes post-holidays.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand declined into Dec holidays: P43-46 avg 72 (44,77,92,75) vs P39-42 avg 98 (-27%), confirming sustained 4-period winter/holiday drop post-fall plateau",
