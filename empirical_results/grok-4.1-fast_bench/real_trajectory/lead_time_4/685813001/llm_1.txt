Seasonal winter/spring apparel; demand historically high Jan-Feb (~80, seed data), drops in spring/summer (confirmed insights: deep summer trough ~10 then July rebound to ~30). Current P26 date 2019/8/5 (early Aug): late summer, rebound/volatility expected to continue but fall demand ramp-up (back-to-school, cooling weather Sep-Oct) likely soon; no major events immediate but anticipate gradual rise toward historical 80s.\n(b) Demand regime: P22-P25: 46,35,18,36 (avg 34, volatile); fits mid-late summer rebound (+180% from June lows per P25 insight). Forecast P26-P30: 30-40/period rising (avg 35), based on rebound continuation + seasonal fall approach; conservative vs historical winter highs.\n(c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (multiple arrivals e.g., P24 order pending P28, prior P23/P24 in-transit). No missing/lost orders; in-transit 140 = P23:100 (arrives P27) + P24:40 (P28).\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 23 (covers P26 demand ~30-35, risk mild stockout if >23 as P25=36).

Total coverage on-hand+transit=163 vs ~175 cum demand P26-P30 (short ~12, but volatile upside risk with fall).\n(e) Final order logic: Order 60 to arrive P30, replenishing projected P30 end=0 + safety for P30-P33 (covers ~35*2 + buffer for rise/volatility/lead delay); balances stockout risk (lost profit $1/u) vs holding ($1/u/period), avoids excess (pipeline heavy short-term); positions for fall ramp without overstock.",
