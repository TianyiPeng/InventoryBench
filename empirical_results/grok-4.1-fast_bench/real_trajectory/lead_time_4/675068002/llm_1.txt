  "rationale": "(a) Product: Women's everyday cotton blouse (straight-cut, long-sleeve). Date 2019/12/30: post-Christmas (P46=12/23), end-of-year/New Year's eve; demand for apparel likely minimal post-holiday peak (returns/shopping fatigue), aligning with summer lows (~20-50); no major events boosting blouses. (b) Demand: Holiday surge peaked P42=295 (Thanksgiving/early Christmas buildup), sharp post-peak dip P43-P46:60\u219273\u219259\u219252 (4-period avg61, -80% from peak, stable low ~summer regime P24-32 avg~29 but slightly higher pre/post-Christmas). Forecast P47: ~50-60 (continuation of low regime). Historical early-year (P1-5:41-51 steady low). (c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods (all arrivals P5-P46 confirm, e.g., P46 arrived P42 order). No missing orders (all tracked orders arrived on time); in-transit=600 matches P43:200 (arrives P47), P44:200 (P48), P46:200 (P50); P45:0 (P49). (d) Inventory: On-hand=656 (high, from P46 end=656 post-arrival P42:250 & low demand=52). Pipeline covers P47-P50: +200(P47)+200(P48)+0(P49)+200(P50)=600, total coverage >> low demand forecast (e.g., 60x4=240). (e) Order 0: High on-hand/pipeline vs. low post-holiday demand minimizes holding costs ($1/unit/period=profit); rebuild if demand rises in future periods.",
