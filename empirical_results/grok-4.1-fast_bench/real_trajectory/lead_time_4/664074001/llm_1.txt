(e) Order logic: Order 0 to minimize holding costs ($434/period vs ~$160 profit at 40 sold); ample coverage thru pipeline gap; replenish only post-Christmas if regime shifts.",

Hist winter demand (Jan-Feb provided:82,52,45,99,108 avg~77 variable). Carry-over confirms deep winter low for this SKU.

No new regime shift (needs 3+ consistent). Forecast P46 holiday bump ~90, then drop to ~50-60/wk (winter low + post-holiday).

(e) Order logic: Ample buffer vs low regime + holiday adj; order 0 mirrors successful P40-P45 strategy (inv drawdown from 400s w/o stockout despite vol); prioritizes holding cost reduction ($1/unit/period) over unlikely short-term stockout (lost profit $4 equiv ~4 holding periods, but coverage holds).
