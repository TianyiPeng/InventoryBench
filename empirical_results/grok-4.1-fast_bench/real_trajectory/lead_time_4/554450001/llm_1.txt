Winter season in northern hemisphere, but indoor casual wear stable.

No current demand data; forecast ~220-245/period. (c) Promised lead time=4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1, no prior history), cannot infer actual LT or losses. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; pipeline empty. Demand this period (after decision) will cause stockout/lost sales (~220 units forgone profit).

(e) Order (LT+1)=5 periods \xd7 225 forecast =1125 to initiate pipeline, cover Periods 5+ demand, build buffer vs. uptrend/Valentine's. Conservative start avoids excess holding early; adjust future based on outcomes. High profit/HC ratio ($19/$1) favors service level.",

P12 uptick to 126 not sustained (single period <3+ evidence), remains low vs prior regimes (-47% from P6-8). Forecast ~100-110/period short-term. (c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (P1-4 orders arrived P5-8 exactly). No orders since P4, in-transit=0, no missing/overdue shipments. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=3383 (post-P12), covers ~30-35 periods at ~100/wk demand. No in-transit. High holding risk ($1/unit/period = ~$3.4k/period cost), prioritize depletion. (e) Order logic: Order 0. Massive buffer covers lead time + demand uncertainty (L+1=5 periods ~500 units needed vs 3383 avail).
