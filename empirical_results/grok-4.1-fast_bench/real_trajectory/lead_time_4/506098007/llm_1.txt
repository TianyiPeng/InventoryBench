(b) Demand: High regime P20-24 (89,110,169,107,106; avg=116, std~27); sustained 5 periods (+150% vs prior low ~46 P9-19), consistent with P23 carry-over; forecast ~116/period short-term. (c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (e.g., P24 order exp P28; all prior: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P18->P22). In-transit 900 = 300(P22->P26) +300(P23->P27)+300(P24->P28); no delays/losses. (d) Inventory: On-hand=0 (P25 stockout expected). Pipeline covers P26-28 (300/period vs ~116 demand): projected ends P26:~184, P27:~368, P28:~552 (excess buffer building). Total remaining periods ~23, pipeline + depletion covers ~10 periods. (e) Order 0: Avoid excess inventory (projected ~550 end-P28, holding=profit hurts); pipeline provides safety amid high/var demand. Replenish later (e.g., P29 decision for P33) as depletes ~P33.",
