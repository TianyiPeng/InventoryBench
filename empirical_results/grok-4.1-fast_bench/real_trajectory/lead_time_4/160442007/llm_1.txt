(b) Demand regimes: Carry-over notes fall escalation (230 avg P29-34), pre-holiday lull (110 avg P39-41 confirmed), P42 holiday spike 311 broke lull but P43-44 reverted low (107,88 avg 97.5, -69% vs fall); volatile not sustained; forecast P45-P46 holiday spike 250-350 (calendar + peaks), P47 post-holiday drop ~150; historical winter early (114 avg) but evolved higher.
