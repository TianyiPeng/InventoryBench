Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), basic men's cotton jersey t-shirt (underwear category). No prior game periods or conclude messages; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical samples (5 weeks Jan-Feb 2019): demands 76,64,73,53,65 (mean~66.2, std~8.1), stable no changepoints. Early Feb, no major spikes (post-holiday, minor Valentine irrelevance for men's basics). No lead time observations. Use defaults: L=promised 4; mu_hat=5*mean(all); sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*std(all). Balances high service (q~19/20=0.95) vs holding with initial forecast covering 5 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18), post-Valentine's Day (Feb 14 during Period 1 week). Period 1 demand=96 spiked +45% above historical mean ~66 (samples: 76,64,73,53,65; std~9), likely holiday-driven for men's basic T-shirt underwear; not sustained (1 period only, needs 3+ for regime shift). On-hand=0 after full stockout (demand 96 > prior order 81=cap). In-transit=81 from P1 order, no arrivals expected yet (promised L=4; first conclude shows arrived=0 as normal). No observed lead times or losses. Use default L (promised 4). mu_hat EWMA_gamma=0.3 slightly upweights recent spike (~75*5=375 vs default ~331) to boost base_stock/cap ~20% for better service (q=19/20=0.95 targets high fill rate) without overstocking if normalizes. Default sigma_hat as vol shift unconfirmed (single outlier). Pipeline covers ~1 period avg demand; params ensure order builds to (L+1)=5 periods coverage.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), late February, no major calendar events for men's basic t-shirts. Historical seed demands avg ~66 (std ~9.4), but recent P1:96 (+45%), P2:102 (+54%) indicate potential demand uptick. On-hand=0, in-transit=192 (from P1:81 + P2:111), no arrivals yet as expected (promised L=4, P1 order arrives during P5, visible P6). No observed lead times. Use default L (promised 4). mu_hat recent_N=2 (mean=99, so ~495 for 5 periods) to adapt to higher recent demand and avoid stockouts. sigma_hat default for stable variance estimate. Balances higher service (q~0.95) vs holding by elevating mean forecast.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, men's basic cotton jersey t-shirt (underwear category). No seasonal events imminent; steady winter-to-spring transition. On-hand=0, in-transit=321 (sum of orders from P1=81, P2=111, P3=129), no arrivals yet as expected (promised L=4; earliest P1 order arrives during P5, visible in P6). Demands: P1=96, P2=102, P3=119 (recent mean=105.7, up ~60% from pre-game historical mean=66.2); sustained upward shift over 3 periods confirms new regime. No concluded arrivals, so L=default (promised 4). mu_hat=recent_3 and sigma_hat=recent_3 to focus backend on elevated recent demand mean/variance for (1+L)-period forecast, ensuring high service (q=19/20=0.95) covers ~106*(5) ~530 while in-transit ramps up, minimizing stockouts before arrivals. Default sigma scaling sqrt(1+L) handles volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1: avg increased from pre-game 66 to recent 106 (+60%) over 3 periods

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Early March, post-winter for men's cotton t-shirt (underwear category); demand may soften seasonally but recent game periods show elevated levels (P1-4 demands: 96,102,119,82; avg 99.75 vs hist 66). Carry-over confirms regime shift from P1 (+60%). No arrivals observed yet, as expected with promised L=4 (P1 order arrives during P5, visible in P6 conclude); no lead-time data, in-transit=447 matches sum of P1-4 orders (81+111+129+126). No overdue shipments. Use default L (promised=4). mu_hat recent_4 captures ongoing elevated regime (5*99.75\u2248499). sigma_hat recent_4 reflects higher volatility (std\u224813.3, sqrt(5)*13.3\u224830). Parameters target base_stock\u2248499 + 1.645*30\u2248549 (q=19/20=0.95), balancing high service vs holding; with pipeline=447, orders ~100 more to cover 5-period horizon amid stockouts.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18), basic men's cotton jersey round-neck t-shirt (underwear category). Early spring, no major holidays imminent (post-St. Patrick's Day). On-hand:16, in-transit:475 (P2:111, P3:129, P4:126, P5:109; P1:81 arrived Period 5 on time, LT=4). Demands P1-5:96,102,119,82,65 (mean 92.8, std 20.4), higher than pre-game mean 66 but dropping P4-5 (82,65 avg73.5). Prior carry-over shift +60% P1-3 sustained, now 5 periods into regime. No overdue/lost shipments. L default (confirmed LT=4). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture post-P1 regime mean/variance, informing base_stock ~464 + 1.645*~50 for q=19/20=0.95, balancing service vs holding given high pipeline/low on-hand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), early spring; basic men's t-shirt. Demand spiked P1-3 (avg 105.7), dropped P4-6 (82,65,56 avg 67.7, -36%), aligning with pre-game avg 66.2. Confirmed changepoint at P4 (3 periods sustained lower demand). LT consistently 4 (P1 order arrived P5, P2 at P6). On-hand 71, in-transit 413 (P3:129 due P7, P4:126 P8, etc., no losses). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target current low-demand regime (1+L=5 periods mean ~338, std ~20), reducing base stock vs all-data to cut holding costs on high pipeline. L default (promised 4 matches observed). Balances high profit service with low holding amid ample inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg decreased from 105.7 (P1-3) to 67.7 (P4-6) (-36%) over 3 periods

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1): Early April, basic men's cotton t-shirt (RONNY REG RN). Low demand regime sustained since changepoint at P4 (noted in carry-over): P4-7 demands [82,65,56,62] avg=66.25 (std~9.6), matching pre-game avg=66.2; no evidence of shift back to high (P1-3 avg=105.7). Lead times consistently 4 periods (P1 order\u2192P5 LT=4; P2\u2192P6 LT=4; P3\u2192P7 LT=4). On-hand=138 covers P8 demand (~66); in-transit=284 [P4:126 arrives during P8 (visible P9), P5:109\u2192P9, P6:49\u2192P10] provides ample pipeline for L+1=5 periods. No overdue/missing shipments. Set mu_hat recent_4 (N=4=max(min(4,20),3) for regime_length=4) to lower forecast mean\xd75 ~331 vs all-samples higher; L/sigma_hat default (L=4 matches observed; volatility stable ~std=9-11). Lowers base_stock to cut holding on excess inventory (138+284>>demand), balancing service vs cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), spring season approaching Easter (4/21/2019), potential clothing demand uptick as evidenced by P8 demand spike to 128 after low regime P4-7 (avg ~66.5). Lead times consistently 4 periods across 4 concluded arrivals (P1 order->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8); no losses or drifts. Inventory solid: on-hand 136 + in-transit 158 (P5:109 arriving during P9 after decision, P6:49 for P10). Demands P1-3 high (~106), P4-7 low (~66), P8 high (128). Most recent regime low length ~4 periods (P4-7), but P8 suggests shift; use recent_N=5 (P4-8 demands:82,65,56,62,128; mean~78.6, std~29) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to moderately weight recent volatility and uptick. This yields mu_hat~(1+4)*78.6=393, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*29~65, supporting base_stock ~393 + 1.64*65 ~500 to cover ~5 periods demand at q=0.95 while high current pipeline (294) limits overstock risk.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), men's basic t-shirt. Approaching Easter (4/21, ~1 week ahead), spring season may drive higher apparel demand. Game demands: P1-3 high avg106, P4-6 low avg68 (per carry-over), P7-9:62/128/100 avg97 (uptrend P8-P9). Possible emerging upshift at P8 (128+93% vs P7), but only 2 periods\u2014not sustained yet. Recent changepoint P4 low regime length=3; use recent_N=3 (min 3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to weight latest avg~97/higher vol. All 5 observed LT=4 (P1-5 orders), no losses/overdues. Pipeline: P6:49 due P10, P9:127 due P13; on-hand=145 ample short-term. Params raise mu_hat~(1+4)*97=485 vs default~ (1+4)*90=450 (game avg), boosting base_stock for service (q=19/20=0.95) ahead of potential Easter spike while low holding limits overstock risk.

On-hand 104, in-transit 279 (P7:0 due P11, P8:0 due P12, P9:127 due P13, P10:152 due P14); all prior orders arrived exactly after 4 periods, no losses or drifts. Demand changepoint at P8: avg 66 (P4-7:82,65,56,62) to 106 (P8-10:128,100,90) (+63%), sustained 3 periods, recent regime_length=3 so N=3. L=default (confirmed 4). mu_hat recent_3 and sigma_hat recent_3 raise base_stock to cover ~530 mean demand over 5 periods with recent volatility, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding, proactively stocking for spring uptick while pipeline covers near-term.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: avg increased from 66 (P4-7) to 106 (P8-10) (+63%) over 3 periods

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29): Late April, T-shirt (men's cotton jersey), seasonal demand likely rising into spring/summer. On-hand=0 after P11 stockout (demand=158>104 starting inv). Pipeline=418 (P9:127 arr P13 L=4; P10:152 arr P14; P11:139 arr P15); no overdue/losses, all confirmed L=4. Demand history confirms high regime from P8: P8=128,P9=100,P10=90,P11=158 (avg=119, +80% vs prior low ~66; regime length=4 periods).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6, early May, basic men's cotton t-shirt; no major holidays imminent, steady seasonal demand possible). Recent demand regime high since P8 shift (carry-over confirmed: P8-10 avg 106 vs prior 66; extended P8-12: 128,100,90,158,129 avg 121, sustained 5 periods).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13): Mid-spring, t-shirt demand favors warmer weather; recent high regime P8-13 (128,100,90,158,129,90) avg 115.8 (+75% vs P4-7 low 66.25), sustained 6 periods with stockouts P11-12 (158,129 unmet). P13 dip to 90 but overall elevated. On-hand 37 low, pipeline 577 covers upcoming (P10:152 exp P14, P11:139 P15, etc., all LT=4 observed consistently no losses/overdues). L default (promised 4 confirmed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=6 weights recent regime for higher mean/volatility, ensures base_stock covers ~116*5=580 demand over L+1=5, balancing stockouts vs holding (pipeline high but recent orders align).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained P8-13: avg 115.8 (+75% vs P4-7 66.25), 6 periods with P11-12 stockouts confirming need for elevated forecast

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

High demand regime sustained P8-14 (7 periods): demands [128,100,90,158,129,90,133], avg 118.3 (+78% vs P4-7 avg 66), with stockouts P11-12 confirming need. P13 dip to 90 but P14 rebound to 133 maintains regime. All observed LT=4 (consistent arrivals P5-P10,P13-P14 from P1-P6,P9-P10). On-hand 56 + in-transit 491 (P11-14 orders:139+170+116+66) ample coverage. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on high regime (backend: mu=(1+4)*118.3\u2248591.5, sigma=sqrt(5)*std~sqrt5*32\u224871, high q=19/20=0.95 favors stock for sales vs holding).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27), late spring/early summer; t-shirts see sustained high demand into warmer months. High regime P8-15 confirmed (8 periods, avg demand ~122 vs prior low ~66, +85%; includes stockouts P11-12, recent P13-15:90/133/148 avg 123). No lead time deviations\u2014all observed arrivals exactly 4 periods (latest P11 order arr P15). Pipeline 491 aligns with 4 periods high demand (~120*4=480); on-hand 47 low but P12 order (170) arrives during P16. Use default L=4 (stable). mu_hat recent_8 captures sustained high mean for (1+4)*122~610 base stock target. sigma_hat recent_8 reflects elevated volatility (~24 std vs early ~10) to boost safety stock, balancing profit vs holding amid stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime extended P8-15: avg 122 (+84% vs P4-7 66), 8 periods with continued highs P14-15 (133,148)

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3), early summer start boosting men's t-shirt demand. High demand regime sustained P8-16 (9 periods): demands [128,100,90,158,129,90,133,148,175], avg~128 (+94% vs P4-7 low avg66), with recent peaks P14-16 avg152 and P16=175 confirming continued elevation/stockout risk (ending inv42 low vs demand175). All observed LT=4 (10+ confirms, no losses/overdues; pipeline=486 from P13-16 orders=116+66+139+165, covers ~4*120). No LT changepoint. Use default L=4 (promised matches). mu_hat recent_9 captures elevated mean~(1+4)*128=640 for base stock. sigma_hat recent_9 for high regime volatility (~30) vs default (diluted by lows), balancing high service (q~19/20=0.95) vs holding amid pipeline coverage.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10), summer season for men's basic cotton t-shirts likely sustaining high demand. High demand regime P8-17 confirmed: demands [128,100,90,158,129,90,133,148,175,158], avg 130.9 (+98% vs P4-7 avg 66.25), 10 periods with recent highs P14-17 avg 153.5 and multiple stockouts P11-12,17. On-hand=0, in-transit=548 (P14:66 due P18, P15:139 P19, P16:165 P20, P17:178 P21), all prior orders arrived exactly LT=4 periods (13 confirmed instances, no losses). No overdue shipments. Use default L=4 (matches all observed). recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/volatility regime since P8 changepoint (avg 131, std~29), scaling to (1+4)*131=655 mean demand over review+lead, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding cost with elevated base_stock while cap limits overorder.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime extended P8-17: avg 131 (+98% vs P4-7 66), 10 periods with continued highs P14-17 avg 154 (133,148,175,158)

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/6/17), summer season for men's cotton t-shirts likely sustaining high demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=663 matches expected arrivals from P15(139)-P18(181) orders on 4LT schedule; P14 order arrived P18 as expected (LT=4), no losses or drifts. Demand history confirms high regime P8-18 (11 periods): demands [128,100,90,158,129,90,133,148,175,158,117], avg~130 (+97% vs P4-7 avg66), with peaks P14-17 avg153 and P18=117 still elevated. No changepoint; use recent_N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/volatility. L=default (all 18 observed LT=4). Parameters elevate base_stock for (L+1)=5 periods high demand (~650 mu_hat), improving service (avoid stockouts like P11/12/17/18) to max profit while capping overstock via backend policy; holding cost low relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime extended P8-18: avg 130 (+97% vs P4-7 66), 11 periods with P14-18 avg 142 (133,148,175,158,117) confirming sustained elevation

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24), summer season for men's cotton t-shirts supports sustained high demand. Demand history confirms high regime P8-P19 (12 periods): demands 128,100,90,158,129,90,133,148,175,158,117,114; avg ~129 (+95% vs P4-7 avg 66). Recent P14-P19 avg 141 confirms elevation despite minor P19 dip to 114. No lead time deviations\u2014all observed arrivals exactly 4 periods (latest P15 order arrived P19). On-hand 25 low, in-transit 615 covers expected (P16:165 in P20, P17:178 in P21, etc.). Use recent_12 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high mean/volatility over regime length N=12 (max(min(12,20),3)); L default (promised 4 consistent). This elevates base_stock ~5x129=645 to cover (1+4) high-demand periods, balancing high profit vs holding while backend caps overage.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime extended P8-19: avg 129 (+95% vs P4-7 66), 12 periods with P14-19 avg 141 (133,148,175,158,117,114) confirming sustained elevation

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1, early July summer peak for men's cotton T-shirts, aligning with sustained high demand). Demand regime high since changepoint P8 (13 periods P8-P20: avg ~133, +101% vs P4-P7 low avg 66), evidenced by P14-P20 avg 146 (133,148,175,158,117,114,179) and recent highs like P20=179; early summer seasonality supports elevation. All observed lead times exactly 4 periods (no drifts/losses, e.g., P16 order arrived P20). On-hand 11 low, but P17 order (178) arrives during P21 (visible P22), pipeline 554 (P17-20 orders) covers ~4 periods ahead at high demand. L=default (promised 4 confirmed). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=13 (regime length 13>=3, captures sustained high mean/variance vs all-data dilution). Raises OR base_stock/target for (1+4)=5 periods high demand (~665 mu), z~1.645 for q=19/20=0.95 balances stockouts vs holding on incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime extended P8-20: avg 133 (+101% vs P4-7 66), 13 periods with P14-20 avg 146 (133,148,175,158,117,114,179) and P20=179 confirming sustained summer elevation

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8, mid-summer): Men's cotton t-shirt demand remains in sustained high summer regime P8-21 (14 periods, avg 133 vs P4-7 avg 66.25, +101%; recent P18-21: 117,114,179,137 avg 137). All observed lead times consistently 4 periods (latest P21 arrive from P17), no losses/overdues; in-transit 558 covers ~4 periods high demand, on-hand 52 low vs expected ~140 demand (risk stockout). Use recent_N N=14 (regime_length=14>3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on high mean/volatility (std~28 from recent), default L=4. Elevates mu_hat~(1+4)*133=665, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*28~63; with q=19/20=0.95 (z~1.645), base_stock~665+104=769 minus pipeline~558 nets ~211 order (capped), balances high service vs holding amid ample pipeline.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime extended P8-21: avg 133 (+101% vs P4-7 66), 14 periods with P18-21 avg137 (117,114,179,137) and prior highs confirming sustained summer elevation

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15): Mid-summer, peak season for men's cotton t-shirts with sustained high demand regime P8-P22 (15 periods, avg ~133, +101% vs P4-7 low of 66), recent P20-22 avg 145 (179,137,118) still elevated despite P22 dip. Lead times consistently 4 periods across all 14+ observations (e.g., P18 order arrived P22). No overdue/lost shipments; in-transit 536 + on-hand 115 covers multiple periods of high demand. Parameters use recent_15 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on summer high mean/volatility (backend scales by (1+4)=5), L default=4 to match reality.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22), mid-summer for men's cotton t-shirt underwear; sustained high demand regime P8-P23 (16 periods, avg ~133, +101% vs P4-7 avg66), recent P20-23:179/137/118/102 avg134 still elevated vs low regime, no demand drop evidenced by P23=102 (>66 lows). Lead time consistently 4 periods across all 14 observed arrivals (e.g., P19 order arr P23), no losses/overdues; in-transit 556 (P20-23 orders) + on-hand 104 covers upcoming. Use recent_N=16 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on high summer regime (N=max(min(16,20),3)=16), L default (promised 4, matches all observed). Elevates base_stock/mu_hat ~ (5)*133=665 to cover (L+1)=5 periods high demand, balancing stockouts (e.g., P11/12/17/18) vs holding; cap limits overorder.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29, late July summer): Sustained high demand regime P8-24 (17 periods, avg ~130, +97% vs P4-7 avg66), despite recent dip P24=82 and P20-24 avg124; t-shirt aligns with summer elevation continuing. Lead times consistently 4 periods across 20+ observations (e.g., P24 arrival from P20), no losses/overdues; pipeline 545 (P21-24 orders:182+159+111+93) + on-hand126 covers ~5 periods at 130/demand. Use recent_N=17 (regime_length=17 from P8 changepoint, min(17,20)=17) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to focus backend on high mean/vol vs default all-samples low bias; L=default (promised=actual=4). Ensures elevated base_stock ~5*130 +1.645*sigma for q=19/20=0.95, balancing profit vs holding amid sustained highs.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime extended P8-24: avg 130 (+97% vs P4-7 66), 17 periods with P20-24 avg 124 (179,137,118,102,82) confirming sustained summer elevation

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5), early August, men's cotton t-shirt; sustained summer high demand regime P8-25 per history but new downshift evident P23-25 (102,82,56 avg80, -40% from P8-22 avg133), significant sustained 3 periods confirming regime change amid late summer taper. All lead times exactly 4 periods (no losses/drift, e.g., P25 arrive P21 order). OH=252 + in-transit=436 (P22-25 orders:159+111+93+73) covers >5 periods at 80 avg demand. Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to quickly adapt to lower mean/vol, yielding mu_hat~(1+4)*80=400, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*19~42 vs prior highs ~650/ higher std; lowers base_stock to curb excess holding (high OH already), maintains high service (q=19/20=0.95) while preventing overorder if low regime persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: avg decreased from 133 (P8-22) to 80 (P23-25) (-40%) over 3 periods

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

No calendar holidays imminent; seasonal taper expected into fall. Lead times consistently 4 periods (all arrivals confirm, e.g., P26: P22 order arrived after 4; no losses/overdues). Pipeline: OH=329 + IT=277 (P23:111+P24:93+P25:73+P26:0) =606, covers >7 periods at 80/demand. Use default L=4 (matches actual). recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=4>=3, post-changepoint P23) to lower base_stock~402 reflecting drop, minimizing overstock/holding costs ($1/unit/period) while q=19/20=0.95 targets high service; OR will likely order 0 given high position.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019/8/19), late summer for men's cotton t-shirt; demand tapering post-summer peak. Recent demands P23-27: 102,82,56,82,108 (avg 86, down -35% from P8-22 high avg133), confirming changepoint at P23 over 5 periods (regime_length=5, N=5). All historical arrivals confirm exact LT=4 (no drifts/losses, e.g., P27 arrive from P23 order). On-hand 332 + in-transit 166 covers ample coverage; expected P24 order (93) arrives during P28 (visible P29). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to lower forecast (mu~5*86=430, sigma~sqrt5*20.5~46), balancing lower demand vs holding costs ($1/unit/period) with profit $19; default L=4 as consistent. Prevents overordering given high inventory.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P23-27: avg 86 (-35% vs P8-22 133), 5 periods (102,82,56,82,108) confirming sustained post-summer drop

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26): Late summer, men's basic t-shirt demand in post-summer decline regime. P23-28 demands (102,82,56,82,108,115) avg 90.8 (-32% vs P8-22 summer high 133), confirming sustained drop over 6 periods (changeloint P23). On-hand 310 high (after P28 ending 310), in-transit 81 (P25 order 73 arrives during P29 unseen yet + P28:8), no overdue shipments, all historical LT=4 exact. High inventory buffers multiple periods (~3+ at avg91), low orders recent. Use default L (promised 4 confirmed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_6 for post-summer regime lowers base_stock vs default/all-history (early avg~90 but ignores summer), reduces overordering/holding risk while q=19/20=0.95 maintains service; cap limits excess.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P23-28: avg 91 (-32% vs P8-22 133), 6 periods (102,82,56,82,108,115) confirming sustained post-summer drop

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2, early September, post-summer). Men's basic cotton t-shirt demand in sustained low post-summer regime: P23-29 demands [102,82,56,82,108,115,96] avg 92 (-31% vs summer P8-22 avg133), 7 periods confirming drop (no calendar spikes expected in early Sep for this product). On-hand 287 high, pipeline 135 (P26:0/P30, P27:0/P31, P28:8/P32, P29:127/P33), all on promised LT=4, no losses/overdues. Use default L=4 (consistent actuals). recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to forecast low regime over review+lead=(1+4)=5 periods, balancing high on-hand/low demand to minimize holding while covering ~460 mean demand (92*5). OR backend's base-stock will order conservatively given high inventory.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P23-29: avg 92 (-31% vs P8-22 133), 7 periods (102,82,56,82,108,115,96) confirming sustained post-summer drop

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9), post-summer low demand regime sustained P23-30 avg 92 (102,82,56,82,108,115,96,94), -31% vs summer P8-22 avg133, 8 periods confirming post-summer drop for men's t-shirt (no major events). On-hand 193 + in-transit 245 = 438 covers ~5 periods at 92/demand (460 needed). All historical lead times exactly 4 periods (e.g., P30 expected from P26=0 arrived 0; P29 from P25=73). No overdue/lost shipments. Use default L=4. recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set mu_hat=(1+4)*92=460, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*~18.5~41, balancing low mean (low orders to avoid excess holding on 193 OH) with recent vol while high service (q~19/20=0.95).

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P23-30: avg 92 (-31% vs P8-22 133), 8 periods (102,82,56,82,108,115,96,94) confirming sustained post-summer drop

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16), post-summer fall period for men's basic cotton t-shirt; demand in sustained low regime since changepoint P23 (avg 90.4 over P23-31: 102,82,56,82,108,115,96,94,79; -32% vs summer P8-22 avg133), confirmed by 9 periods including recent P29-31 avg90. No LT deviations\u2014all observed arrivals exactly 4 periods (latest P29: P25 order). On-hand 114 + in-transit 335 = pipeline 449 covers ~5 periods demand at 90/demand, ample buffer. Use recent_N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor forecast on low regime (mu_hat~(1+4)*90.4=452, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*std~sqrt(5)*16=36), reducing base_stock vs all-data default (higher mean/var from summer), minimizing holding costs ($1/unit) while maintaining service (profit$19>>holding). L default as confirmed consistent.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P23-31: avg 90 (-32% vs P8-22 133), 9 periods (102,82,56,82,108,115,96,94,79) confirming sustained post-summer drop

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Late September, post-summer period for men's cotton t-shirt; sustained low demand regime P23-32 (10 periods: demands 102,82,56,82,108,115,96,94,79,59; avg 87.3, -34% vs summer P8-22 avg133), confirmed by carry-over insights and recent lows (P30-32:94,79,59 avg77). No lead time deviations\u2014all observed arrivals exactly 4 periods (latest P32: P28 order). Pipeline 396= P29(127)+P30(110)+P31(90)+P32(69), arriving P33-36 on schedule; on-hand 63 covers immediate low demand (~60-90). Use recent_N N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect low regime mean/variance over full regime length, L default (promised=4 stable). Lowers mu_hat~(1+4)*87=435 vs prior higher, reduces overstock/holding while ensuring service for 5 periods (z~1.645 for q=19/20=0.95).

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P23-32: avg 87 (-34% vs P8-22 133), 10 periods (102,82,56,82,108,115,96,94,79,59) with recent P30-32 avg77 confirming sustained post-summer drop

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30), late September, post-summer period for men's basic cotton t-shirt. Low demand regime sustained post-P23 drop (-34% vs summer P8-22 avg133), recent P24-33 demands [82,56,82,108,115,96,94,79,59,117] avg88.8 confirming low mean despite P33=117 outlier (10-period avg holds ~89, regime_length=10). On-hand=73 covers current low demand; in-transit=319 ample pipeline (expected P34 arrival includes P30 order=110, LT=4 consistent across all 20+ observed arrivals, no losses/overdues). Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low regime (backend: mu=(1+4)*89=445, sigma=sqrt(5)*~20=45 est.), default L=4. Lowers base_stock vs all-data (which includes summer highs), balances service vs holding on high inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7), early fall for men's basic t-shirt; post-summer low demand regime from changepoint P23 sustained P23-34 (12 periods, avg demand 90.8: 102,82,56,82,108,115,96,94,79,59,117,100), vs prior high P8-22 avg133 (-32%). Recent P33-34 (117,100 avg108.5) slight uptick but insufficient evidence for new regime shift (only 2 periods). All observed lead times exactly 4 periods (e.g., P34 arrived P30 order), no losses or drifts; default L appropriate. On-hand 83 + in-transit 333 covers multiple low-demand periods. Use recent_N=12 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor forecast on sustained low regime (lowers mu_hat~(1+4)*90.8=454, adjusts sigma_hat accordingly), enabling OR backend to set lower base_stock vs all-history high mean, minimizing holding costs ($1/unit) on ample pipeline while high q~0.95 ensures service for profit maximization ($19/unit).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

No calendar events spiking demand. Lead time consistently 4 periods (all 25+ observed arrivals confirm). In-transit 355 = exact sum P32-35 orders (69+50+124+112), no losses/overdues; on-hand 81 adequate short-term. Parameters: default L (promised 4); recent_13 mu_hat/sigma_hat capture low regime mean/vol for (1+4)*91~455 base demand over review+lead, with z* from q=19/20=0.95 high service; caps prevent overorder amid holding costs.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21), late October, men's basic t-shirt/underwear; post-summer low demand regime sustained P23-P36 (14 periods, avg 86.8, -35% vs summer P8-22 avg133), recent P33-P36 avg85.5 (117,100,92,33), P36=33 low but not sustained shift (1 period). LT consistently 4 across all concluded orders (e.g., P36 arrive from P32). On-hand 117 + in-transit 375 (P33:50\u2192P37, P34:124\u2192P38, P35:112\u2192P39, P36:89\u2192P40) covers ~5 periods at 87 avg (435). Default L=4 (promised, matches all observed). mu_hat recent_14 (low regime length=14, backend:5*86.8\u2248434) lowers forecast vs all-data/summer for less overstock. sigma_hat recent_14 captures low-regime volatility (std~23 vs full ~40), tightens base_stock to balance high profit/high service vs low holding amid ample pipeline/inventory.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P23-36: avg 87 (-35% vs P8-22 133), 14 periods with P33-36 avg85 confirming sustained post-summer drop

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28), late October post-summer for men's basic t-shirt underwear; no major events like Halloween driving demand spikes expected. Low demand regime sustained P23-37 (15 periods, avg 84.4, -37% vs summer P8-22 avg133), confirmed by carry-over; recent P35-37 (92,33,51 avg59) lower but only 3 periods, not yet a new sustained changepoint (requires 3+ consistent). All observed lead times exactly 4 periods (e.g., P37 arrival from P33), no losses/overdues; expected arrivals: P38=124(P34), P39=112(P35), P40=89(P36), P41=30(P37). High pipeline (OH116 + IT355=471 covers ~5-6 periods at 85/demand). Use recent_N N=15 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor OR backend on current low regime mean/variance, yielding mu~5*84.4=422 (L+1=5), appropriate base stock ~422 +1.645*sigma (q=19/20=0.95) balancing low demand vs holding $1/unit; default L=4 as stable.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4, early November, colder weather for men's basic cotton t-shirt/underwear likely suppresses demand further post-Halloween). Low demand regime since P23 (mid-July post-summer drop) confirmed sustained avg ~87 (P23-36 per carry-over), but new changepoint at P36: P36-38 demands 33/51/68 avg 51 (-41% vs prior low avg 87), 3 periods consistent evidence of winter drop. On-hand 172 + in-transit 274 (exactly P35:112 + P36:89 + P37:30 + P38:43, all LT=4 confirmed consistently no losses/delays). LT stable at 4 all observed (latest P38 arrival from P34). Use default L (promised 4). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=3 (new regime length=3, max(min(3,20),3)=3) to forecast low mean/vol ~51 across (1+4)=5 periods, lowering base stock vs prior higher low-regime avg, reduces holding risk with ample pipeline/on-hand covering 5+ periods low demand (~250 units needed vs 446 available), balances high profit/low holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: avg decreased from 87 (P23-35) to 51 (P36-38) (-41%) over 3 periods confirming winter drop for t-shirts

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

No upcoming holidays spiking t-shirt demand (Veterans Day minor). On-hand 221 + in-transit 162 covers >10 periods of low demand (~50/wk), high inventory risks holding costs. All historical arrivals confirm exact lead_time=4 (e.g., P39:112 from P35; P38:124 from P34), no losses/drift. Use recent_N=4 (regime_length=4 since P36 changepoint, min(4,20)=4>3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to lower (1+4)*54=270 base_stock mean and recent low vol, balancing low service need vs holding; L=default (promised=observed=4).

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P36-39: avg 54 (33,51,68,63; -38% vs P23-35 87), 4 periods confirming sustained winter drop for t-shirts

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18): Winter low demand for men's t-shirt confirmed, recent P36-40 demands [33,51,68,63,48] avg 52.6 (std ~13.7), -39% vs prior low regime P23-35 avg87, sustained 5 periods post changepoint P36. High on-hand 262 + in-transit 73 (P37 order30 + P38 order43, both expected L=4 arrival P41/P42) covers 6+ periods demand. All historical lead times exactly 4 periods, no losses/overdues. Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to lower base_stock reflecting winter drop, reducing holding costs (q=19/20=0.95 still high service); L default as stable.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P36-40: avg 53 (33,51,68,63,48; -39% vs P23-35 87), 5 periods confirming sustained winter drop for t-shirts

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Late November, post-Thanksgiving/Black Friday approaching, but men's basic t-shirt (underwear/jersey) shows no holiday spike; winter low demand regime sustained P36-41 (demands:33,51,68,63,48,55; avg=53, -39% vs P23-35 avg87), 6 periods confirming drop. All historical arrivals exactly 4 periods lead time (no losses/drift). On-hand=237 + in-transit=43 (likely P38 order=43 arriving P42) covers ~5 periods demand (5*53=265). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect low regime (backend: mu_hat=5*53=265, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*std~12); default L=4. Balances high service vs low holding by lowering base_stock forecast. No overdue shipments.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P36-41: avg 53 (33,51,68,63,48,55; -39% vs P23-35 87), 6 periods confirming sustained winter drop for t-shirts

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2, Cyber Monday week following Black Friday P42 demand=207 spike). T-shirt demand low in winter (P36-41 avg53, -39% vs prior), but holiday sales disrupting: P42 +290% spike. On-hand=73 + in-transit=31 (P42 order arriving P46) =104 pipeline vulnerable to stockout if P43 ~150+. All 40+ observed LT=4 exactly, no drifts/losses (latest P38->P42). No new changepoints (P42 single-period spike, not sustained 3+). Use recent_N=5 (P38-42 regime vol, N=max(min(7 recent,20),3) adjusted for spike inclusion) for mu_hat/sigma_hat: recent mean~88 (+65% vs winter low), mu_hat~440 for 5-period cover; sigma~134 reflects holiday vol. Boosts OR base_stock/service (q=0.95) vs default all-time mean~101 (past summer bias), limits holding via cap~187 while enabling ~180 order-up to prevent lost sales (19>>1).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), early December pre-Christmas, men's basic cotton t-shirt (underwear category). Winter low demand regime from P36 confirmed (carry-over avg53 P36-41), with Thanksgiving holiday spike P42=207 (11/25, +290% vs avg53), but P43=64 returned low (no sustained high). P36-43 demands avg 73.6 (33,51,68,63,48,55,207,64), indicating sustained winter low ~74 despite outlier spike; expect similar low-mod with possible Christmas bump P46-47 but no 3+ period evidence yet. All observed lead times exactly 4 periods (e.g., P43 no arrival as expected from P39 order=0; pipeline=230 from P42=31+P43=199). On-hand=9 low, pipeline+on-hand=239 vs expected 5-period demand ~368; parameters use recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current winter regime/volatility (higher var from spike), L=default (consistent 4). This raises base_stock for service level during holidays while limiting overstock (q=19/20=0.95), backend caps order sensibly.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P36-43: avg 74 (-16% vs P23-35 87), 8 periods confirming sustained winter drop for t-shirts despite single P42 Thanksgiving spike 207

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), pre-Christmas for men's basic t-shirt; winter low demand regime sustained P36-44 (9 periods, avg 74, demands:33,51,68,63,48,55,207[Thanksgiving anomaly],64,80), confirming carry-over winter drop despite P44=80 fitting regime (no sustained holiday uptick yet). On-hand=0 after P44 stockout (sold=9/80); in-transit=395 sufficient coverage assuming L=4 arrivals soon (all historical arrivals exactly 4 periods, no losses/overdues). Recent_N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat uses P36-44 samples (regime_length=9, capped<20) to set mu_hat=5*74=370, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*std~ reflects low mean/vol despite spike; default L=4 as observed consistent. Balances high service (q~0.95) vs holding by anchoring winter low, preventing summer-overforecast; pipeline covers ~5+ periods low demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23), pre-Christmas week (Dec 25). Basic men's cotton t-shirt; winter low demand regime sustained P36-45 (10 periods, avg 77, demands:33,51,68,63,48,55,207,64,80,104) despite holiday spikes (P42 Thanksgiving 207, P45 104). Recent stockouts P44 (sold 9/80), P45 (0/104). On-hand 0, pipeline 555 = expected arrivals: P46:31 (P42 order), P47:199 (P43), P48:165 (P44), P49:160 (P45). All historical arrivals confirmed lead_time=4 (no losses/overdues). No new changepoint; winter low sustained (avg77 -35% vs summer 133). Use recent_N=10 (regime_length=10 since P36 shift) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect low mean/variance; L default (confirmed 4). This lowers mu_hat ~385 vs overall ~500, high sigma_hat from spikes boosts safety stock ~z*sigma*sqrt5 for service vs holding balance; pipeline covers ~5*77=385 + buffer, minimal new order needed.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas/New Year's Eve in winter; t-shirts see sustained low demand regime since changepoint P36 (2019/10/14 winter drop), extended through P46 (avg P36-46 ~75.5, e.g., 33,51,68,63,48,55,207[Thanksgiving spike],64,80,104,58). Recent P44-46 avg ~81 still low vs summer highs. No overdue shipments; all observed lead times=4 periods consistently (latest P46: P42 order). In-transit=538 (P43:199/P47, P44:165/P48, P45:160/P49, P46:14/P50) covers ~7 periods at 75/demand. On-hand=0 but P47 arrival (199+) post-decision covers current. Use L default (promised 4 confirmed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_11 (regime_length=11, max(min(11,20),3)=11) to anchor low mean/vol, yielding mu_hat~(1+4)*75.5=377.5, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*std_recent~ high due to holiday spikes but realistic. Lowers base_stock vs all-data default, yielding order~0 (pipeline>base_stock) to minimize holding on incoming 538 while covering (L+1)=5 periods demand.
