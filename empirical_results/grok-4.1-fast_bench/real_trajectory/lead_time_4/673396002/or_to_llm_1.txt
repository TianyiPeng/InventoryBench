Inventory analysis: On-hand 305 covers expected P47 demand (~150-200); post-arrival ~305 - demand +300 + future pipeline ample for (1+4)=5 periods (expected 5*~150=750 < 1005 total pipeline). Demand analysis: Date 2019/12/30 post-Christmas (after P46=197 on 12/23 holiday peak). Carry-overs confirm holiday spike P42-45 avg140/P45=216, P46=197 sustained high, but world knowledge suggests post-holiday dip for fashion accessories (belts) due to returns/gift fatigue/New Year normalization; recent avg P44-46=181 cooling potential vs peaks. Full history volatile (early lows, cycles per carry-overs). OR recommendation: 123 units, using promised L=4 and full-history mean (likely ~25-30/period given cap), conservative due to historical lows pulling down despite recent highs. Strategy: Follow OR 123 - aligns with base-stock to target ~5*OR_mean ~125-150, prevents excess holding (profit=holding=1, q=0.5 no safety bias); ample pipeline buffers post-holiday uncertainty, no override needed as no regime shift evidence or lead anomaly.",
