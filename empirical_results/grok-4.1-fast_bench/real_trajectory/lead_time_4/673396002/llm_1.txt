No major seasonal peaks (post-holiday winter period). (b) Demand regime analysis: Historical weekly data (5 periods to 2019-02-04): 407,374,295,130,213; mean=284, std~110. Volatile: high early Jan (390 avg first 2), decline late Jan (130 low), partial rebound Feb4 (213). No sustained regime shift (late 3 periods avg=213 but only 3 samples, not consistent >3 periods at new level). Use full historical mean mu=284 as forecast. (c) Lead-time vs. missing orders: Promised LT=4; no 'conclude' messages yet (Period 1), cannot infer actual LT or losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; fully depleted, no coverage for Period 1 demand (expected stockout). Empty pipeline.

Balances stockout risk (lost profit $1/unit) vs. holding ($1/unit/period); conservative given equal costs and volatile demand.",

Date 2019/12/23 (Mon) is Christmas week (12/23-12/29 includes 12/25), peak retail/holiday shopping period\u2014expect demand spike like prior peaks (~400 summer, ~500 b2s). (b) Demand regime: low pre-Christmas stabilized P42-45 avg ~133 (122,93,129,216), but P45 +216 (+67% vs P42-44 avg115) signals emerging holiday uptick; aligns with calendar, building on summer/b2s patterns\u2014no sustained new regime yet (volatile uptrend <3 consistent periods). Forecast P46 ~350 (holiday peak), post ~200-250 tapering. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (all arrivals confirm, e.g., P45 none as expected; latest P43 order=400 due P47). No missing/lost orders; in-transit=400 solely from P43. (d) On-hand=1408 (high, covers ~4wks@350/wk); no P46 arrival; P47 +400 (total ~1810 pre-P48 demand, ample); no further pipeline (P44/45 orders=0 arrive P48/49). Risk: post-P47 depletion if holiday extends. (e) Order 400 to replenish P50 pipeline for potential holiday tail/post-NY demand (avg~250\xd74wks=1000 need, covers w/ safety vs stockouts like P18-20/33); high on-hand tempers but profit=holding=1 demands service level > excess; conservative match recent order sizing (P43=400).",
