No major seasonal peaks for jeggings now (steady year-round, possible spring ramp later). (b) Demand regime: Historical (5 weeks): 28,20,21,11,11; avg=18.2. Recent 2wks=11 (low), early 3wks~23 (high). Possible decline but only 2pts - not sustained (need 3+). Baseline forecast ~15-18/period. (c) Lead time: No history. Promised=4.

No major retail events (e.g., no Easter until Apr21, no spring fashion peaks yet).

Recent: P1(Feb11)=12, P2=10, P3=6 (avg 9.3 over 3 periods, -25% from prior regime). Continued decline evident but not yet sustained new mean (needs 3+ consistent lows); forecast ~7-9/period short-term, low variance.\n(c) Lead time: Promised 4 periods.

{
  "rationale": "(a) Product: Jeggings (high-waist skinny denim trousers for ladies) - casual winter lower-body apparel, suits cold weather layering, holiday gifting/post-holiday sales. Date 2019-12-30: post-Christmas (Dec25 passed P46=12/23), New Year's Eve week; demand likely sustained elevated from holiday surge (BF/Christmas) but poised for taper into Jan 2020 as peak shopping ends, shifting to normal winter levels. (b) Demand regime: Stable holiday plateau ~125 avg (P43-P46:122,130,126,122; consistent post-BF decline from 338 but +240% vs pre-holiday ~49, no new drop signal yet despite post-Xmas timing. Historical winter low pre-surge (Feb-Mar ~10, but different year cycle). Forecast P47-P51: ~110-125/period tapering to ~100. (c) Lead time: Confirmed consistently 4 periods (latest: P42 order arrived P46 LT=4; all prior matches, no drifts/losses). In-transit 450 reliable: P43:250 arrives P47; P46:200 arrives P50. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (P47 starts stockout). Post-P47: arrive+250, demand~120 \u2192 end~130; P48: start130 arrive0 demand~120 \u2192 end~10; P49: start10 arrive0 demand~120 \u2192 stockout ~110; P50: arrive+200 demand~110 \u2192 end~90; P51: start90 +Q. Pipeline covers P47/P50 but gap risks P49 stockout (lost ~$440 profit). (e) Final order logic: Order Q=150 for P51 arrival to cover ~120 P51 demand +50 safety buffer for post-holiday drop/variance/gaps; balances $4 profit vs $1 holding (net positive to overstock vs stockout); matches recent high-demand order scale (150-250), builds ~240 end-P51 for coverage while tapering forecast.",
