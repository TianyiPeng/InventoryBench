{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All recent concluded arrivals (e.g., P46:96 from P42; P45:85 from P41; P44:102 from P40) confirm consistent actual lead time of 4 periods, matching promised; no lost shipments evident as in-transit=550 aligns with outstanding orders (P43:250 for P47 arrival + P44:0 + P45:100 + P46:200 =550). Inventory analysis: On-hand=465 + imminent P47 arrival of 250 (P43 order) =715 start for P47 demand, plus remaining pipeline 300 over next 3 periods; total coverage ~1015 units. Demand analysis: Recent P43-P46 demands=50,103,114,69 (avg~84); stable low post-Thanksgiving as per carry-over (P40-P43 avg100, P44-P46 avg95); Dec 30 (P47) post-Christmas/New Year's Eve unlikely to spike for women's blouses (no holiday rebound signal, prior P46=69 on Christmas week low). OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised L=4 and full history (initial high then low/seasonal). Strategy: Follow OR's 0 - excess inventory covers 10+ periods at ~100 demand; profit=holding=1 so minimize holding; no override needed as demand outlook low/stable, no regime shift.",
