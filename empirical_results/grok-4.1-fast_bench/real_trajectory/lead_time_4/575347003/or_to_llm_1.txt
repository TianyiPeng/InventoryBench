{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (e.g., P46: 80 from P42; P45: 50 from P41; P44: 117 from P40; all exactly 4 periods). No lost shipments evident. Inventory analysis: On-hand 288 + in-transit 270 = 558 units pipeline. Recent demand P43-46: 41,45,64,55 (avg 51); P42:101 (Thanksgiving/Black Friday outlier). Carry-over insights note post-summer decline stabilized low ~42-55 into Nov, Dec mixed but avg P42-46 ~61. For L+1=5 periods, expected demand ~250-300; current pipeline covers 9-11 periods. Product: basic men's sneaker socks - no strong New Year's demand driver (post-Christmas 12/30, cold weather steady but not spiking). OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised L=4 and full history (\u03bc\u0304 likely low due to equal weighting of early data). Strategy: Follow OR - no override needed as inventory ample, no regime shift, avoids holding costs ($1/unit/period). Order 0 to let pipeline deplete naturally.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - high inventory position (288 on-hand + 270 in-transit = 558) covers 9+ periods at recent avg demand 50-60 units/period; post-Christmas demand not expected to spike for basic socks.",
