  "rationale": "(a) Product: 7pk basic men's sneaker socks (cotton blend). Winter/post-Christmas (2019/12/30), historical Jan low ~34 avg; no strong winter boost expected for basic socks. Recent holiday signal P42:101 (Thanksgiving/Black Friday) not sustained (P43-P46 avg 51). Post-Xmas/New Year's likely low demand ~50, stable winter regime.\n(b) Demand regime: Confirmed stable low P33-P46 (ex-P42 spike) avg ~51 (P43-P46:41,45,64,55); volatile but no reversal/upward trend (P46:55 aligns). Matches carry-over P40 stable low ~50.3.\n(c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods (all arrivals confirm, e.g., P46 none as expected; next: P43 ord150 due P47, P44 ord100 due P48). No losses/missing.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 415 (+150 due P47 after decision, +100 P48) = ample pipeline 665 total. At 50/wk: covers 13+ periods (proj P47 end~515, P48~565, then deplete ~50/wk to P51~415+X). High but service safe; holding $1 vs profit$19 justifies buffer.\n(e) Order logic: Zero order; replenish only if depletion accelerates (monitor P47-P50). Avoid excess holding while pipeline covers low-demand horizon (winter/Jan low).",
