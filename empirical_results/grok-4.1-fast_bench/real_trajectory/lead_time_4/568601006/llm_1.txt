  "rationale": "(a) Product: Mariette Blazer (women's tailored fitted jacket, upper body garment). Winter formal wear relevant for holiday parties, but date 2019/12/30 (NYE week, post-Christmas 12/25) suggests softening demand after holiday peak; historical Jan 2019 demand avg ~173 (161,145,179,196,186). Calendar: End-of-year slowdown post-Christmas shopping rush; NYE may lift formal wear slightly, but recent Christmas week P46 (12/23) demand=128 low. (b) Demand regimes per carry-over: Winter escalation P33-38 avg365, holiday spike P42=733; recent P43-46 avg215 (169,304,258,128, trending down -50% from P42, -41% vs winter avg365), post-holiday drop emerging but not fully sustained (variance high). Forecast P47 ~180 (blend recent 215 avg + Jan hist 173 + post-holiday trend). (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (latest P42\u2192P46, P43\u2192P47 confirmed). No missing orders. In-transit 750 = P43 ord400 (arr P47) + P46 ord350 (arr P50); P44/45 ord0 \u2192 no arr P48/49. (d) On-hand 693 + P47 arr400 =1093 start P47. Projected (demand@180/wk): P47 end~913; P48~733; P49~553; P50~723 (post +350); P51~543. High buffer covers 5+ periods, no stockout risk near-term. Holding cost pressure ($1/unit/period) on ~700+ inv. (e) Order 0: Pipeline + on-hand covers projected demand through P51+ with ample safety (~3x weekly); avoids excess buildup amid post-holiday softening; replenish later if needed (next order P48\u2192P52). Matches prior low-order strategy in summer/post-peak (P15-26 ord0).",
