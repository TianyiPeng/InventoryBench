(d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 215 (post-P24), covers ~7-10 periods at 25 demand/period; 0 in-transit. High coverage minimizes stockout risk. (e) Order logic: No pipeline needs refill; order 0 to deplete inventory, minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period \xd7 215 already high); monitor for fall recovery next periods.",
