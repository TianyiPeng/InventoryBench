Demand analysis: Sustained low regime per carry-over (~23-28 avg P34-P39; overall recent P30-P41 avg~28 excluding P42 outlier), but P42 demand spiked to 123 (+400% vs recent avg) aligned with late Nov holidays (Thanksgiving/Black Friday week of 11/25). Current P43 date=2019/12/2 (Cyber Monday, early Christmas season); sports bra (H&M ladies activewear) may see moderate holiday uplift for gifts/fitness sales, but no sustained evidence yet (single P42 spike <3 periods). Expected single-period demand ~28-35 (low regime + modest Dec seasonality). Over 1+4=5 periods: ~140-175 total demand. OR recommendation (81 units): Uses promised L=4, full-history empirical mean/std (likely ~27-35/period given base~134=53 pipeline +81 order), critical fractile q=1/(1+1)=0.5 (z*~0), capped reasonably. No override needed: Matches low regime base stock minus pipeline; thin pipeline P44-P45 risks minor stockouts if demand >20-30, but q=0.5 accepts 50% stockout risk; P42 stockout was extreme outlier. Holiday upside possible (Christmas P46 ~12/23), but conservative\u2014no confirmed regime shift. Final strategy: Follow OR 81 to balance expected demand coverage without excess holding near end (5 periods left, ending inv penalized).",
