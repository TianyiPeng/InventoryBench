{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 4 periods across all concluded arrivals (e.g., P46: no arrival expected yet; P45 arrived from P41 (4 periods); P43 from P39, etc.), no lost shipments evident, in-transit 250 matches P43 order of 250 arriving in P47. Inventory position: On-hand 447 + in-transit 250 (arriving P47) = 697, covers 10+ periods at recent demand rate. Demand analysis: Post-Black Friday drop sustained (P43-P46: 30,54,59,60 avg 51, vs P40-P42 avg 155 at -69% per carry-over), consistent with post-holiday normalization for denim into late Dec (12/30 post-Christmas lull, no New Year's spike expected for jeans). OR recommends 0 using promised L=4 and full history (mean likely pulled down by recent lows), aligns perfectly with high inventory and stable low demand ~50-60/period; no regime shift, seasonality supports continued low into Jan. Strategy: Order 0 to avoid excess holding costs ($1/unit/period), pipeline covers (L+1)=5 periods demand (~250) easily.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - high inventory (447 on-hand + 250 in-transit arriving P47 = 697) covers 10+ periods of sustained post-holiday low demand (~50-60/period in P43-P46).",
