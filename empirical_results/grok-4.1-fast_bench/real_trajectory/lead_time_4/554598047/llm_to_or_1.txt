Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), early February, women's basic t-shirt (everyday jersey). Historical weekly demands: 2019-01-07:0, 01-14:0, 01-21:9, 01-28:23, 02-04:26, showing changepoint after 01-14 with demand shifting from 0 to increasing (last 3 avg=19.33 vs first 2 avg=0). No prior game history, on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no shipments to reconcile. Use recent_3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent higher demand regime (N=3=max(min(regime_length=3,20),3)); L=default (promised=4, no observed lead times). This sets mu_hat=5*19.33\u224896.7 (covers recent demand trend over 5 periods), higher service via recent mean helps balance stock-out risk vs holding (q=0.5), with recent sigma for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift after 2019-01-14: avg from 0 (first 2 periods) to 19.3 (last 3 periods, +infinite%), sustained over 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18, Presidents' Day Monday, potential minor demand bump for basics). Product: Womens T-shirt basics, winter date but indoor wear possible. Demand history: initial 0,0 then shift to 9(01/21),23(01/28),26(02/04),54(02/11 p1)\u2014upward regime post-01/14 confirmed by carry-over, now 4 periods high avg=28 (vs prior full mean~11.6). Stockout p1 (demand=54, sold=0). Pipeline:35 in-transit (p1 order, promised L=4 so arrives ~p5, no conclude yet, no overdue/loss). No lead time data, use default L=4. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 captures regime mean/volatility (samples:9,23,26,54; mean28, std~19.5), scales to (1+4)*28=140 for base stock over review+lead, higher than default ~58 to rebuild inventory post-stockout, balancing q=0.5 service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime strengthened: last 4 periods (01/21-02/11) avg 28 (+47% vs prior regime 19.3), sustained over 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25): Basic women's jersey T-shirt, late February (pre-spring, potential seasonal demand uptick for lighter clothing). Demand history shows regime shift to high levels: historical samples avg ~11.6 (std~10.9), but game Period 1 (02/11)=54, Period 2 (02/18)=90 (avg 72, std~25.5); changepoint at Period 1 with sustained high demand over 2 periods (+>200% vs historical). Carry-over confirms shift and strengthening. On-hand=0, in-transit=95 (P1 order=35, P2=60; no arrivals yet, expected P5/P6 if L=4, no overdue/losses). Stockouts caused 144 lost sales. Use recent_N=2 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent surge (backend: mu_hat=5*72=360, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*25.5\u224857), L=default (no LT observations). High mu_hat drives aggressive ordering to cover (L+1)=5 periods demand ~360 while respecting cap, prioritizing profit recovery over holding amid stockouts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, Nora women's jersey T-shirt (everyday basics), no immediate holidays but spring apparel season starting; demands escalating: historical (up to 2019-02-04) low/ rising to avg 11.6, then P1(54), P2(90), P3(55) avg 66.3 (high volatility, std~20.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=209 (P1:35 + P2:60 + P3:114), no arrivals yet (expected: P1 order during P5 arrival phase, visible P5 conclude; no overdue/losses). No concluded lead times observed. Parameters: L=default (promised 4, no evidence of drift); mu_hat=recent_N N=3 ((1+4)*66.3\u2248332, captures recent regime); sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 (sqrt(5)*20.4\u224845.6, reflects volatility). Ensures base_stock ~332 (q=0.5, z~0) covers pipeline + order for elevated demand over L+1=5 periods, preventing stockouts (lost sales hurting profit) while capping limits overstock/holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift Periods 1-3: avg 66.3 (+471% vs historical avg 11.6), sustained over 3 periods with high demands 54/90/55.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): T-shirt basics, early March no major events, steady seasonal but recent game demands spiked P1-3 (54/90/55 avg66.3), P4=29 dip possibly fluctuation not sustained. Carry-over confirms high demand regime P1-3. No arrivals yet (all conclude arrived=0), order P1 expected during P5 arrival (LT=4, visible P6). Pipeline 310/on-hand 0 covers ~5+ periods at recent avg~57. Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to weight high recent regime (mean57, std~25), backend scales by (1+L)~5 for review+lead coverage. L default (promised 4, no confirmed LTs). Balances high service for profit vs holding by elevated mu/sigma on recent data, preventing stockouts amid delays.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18), early spring for women's basic T-shirt; no major holidays but sustained high demand regime from game history (P1-5 avgs 56.4, vs historical low ~11.6), with P1-3 peak ~66, P4 dip to 29, P5 rebound to 54\u2014evidence of volatility but high mean. Pipeline 275 covers expected future (P2:60 exp P6 arr, P3:114 P7, P4:101 P8). One confirmed LT=4 (P1\u2192P5), no overdue/losses. Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current high-demand regime (N=5=max(min(5,20),3)); default L=promised 4. Params ensure base_stock targets ~5*56=280 mean demand over review+LT, high z* (profit=holding=1\u2192q=0.5) balances stockout vs holding; recent stats bridge OR's use of promised LT/historical samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), late March/spring onset for women's basic t-shirt; demand likely stable-to-increasing seasonally. On-hand=0, in-transit=222 (P3:114 expected to arrive during P7 after decision, P4:101, P6:7). No overdue/missing shipments: confirmed L=4 (P1 order arrived P5, P2->P6). High demand regime sustained P1-6: demands [54,90,55,29,54,64], avg=57.7 (+397% vs initial hist avg=11.6), single dip P4=29 but recovered; regime_length=6 >=3. Use recent_6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated mean/volatility (std~19.6), default L=4. Ensures base_stock targets ~58*5=290 over (1+4), balancing q=0.5 service vs holding; OR cap provides safety.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6, two observations)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1), early spring; Nora T-shirt (women's everyday basic) demand likely stable/increasing with warmer weather (Easter 4/21 nearby). Lead times confirmed consistently at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7; P4:101 expected in P8 arrival). Demands: game history avg 53.1 (P1-7: 54/90/55/29/54/64/26), recent P4-7 avg 43.3 but sustained high regime per carry-over (P1-3:66.3). High variance evident. On-hand 88 + in-transit 175 (covers ~5 periods at 53/unit). Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high-demand regime shift (7 periods data, regime_length=7>3); default L (confirmed=promised). This boosts mu_hat~266, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*std~48 (adapts OR to high mean/volatility, balances service vs holding given q=0.5).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring; Nora women's t-shirt (everyday basics) demand likely stable-high with possible Easter (4/21) uptick ahead. Demands P1-P8: 54/90/55/29/54/64/26/92 (avg 58, std ~24), confirming sustained high-volatile regime since P1 (vs hist avg 11.6). Lead time consistently 4 periods (P1@P5, P2@P6, P3@P7, P4@P8; no losses/overdues). On-hand 97 (covers P9 ~60), pipeline 77 (P5:0@P9, P6:7@P10, P7:67@P11, P8:3@P12; total pipeline inventory 174 < ~290 for 5 periods). Use recent_8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current regime (mu_hat=5*58=290, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*24~54); L default (promised 4, confirmed). Balances service (q=0.5, z=0 \u2192 base~290) vs holding with cap~58+1.645*24~98; orders ~116 capped to 98 to replenish ahead of pipeline drawdown.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), spring season for women's everyday t-shirt; Easter on 4/21 may drive upcoming demand spike (P10-P11). Demand regime remains high/volatile since P1 (avg ~63 over 9 periods: 54,90,55,29,54,64,26,92,102), confirmed by carry-over shifts; recent P8-P9 highs (92,102) align with seasonal uptick. Lead time consistently 4 periods (P1-P5, P2-P6, P3-P7, P4-P8 arrivals). No overdue shipments; P6 order (7) arrives during P10 (visible P11). Pipeline 175 covers partial (1+L=5 periods ~315 demand), on-hand 0 after P9 stockout (demand 102 >97). Use default L (matches actual). recent_N N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high-demand regime (ignores pre-P1 lows), boosting base_stock for service vs holding (q=0.5).

Recent demands P8-P10: 92/102/138 (avg 110.7, +108% vs P1-P7 avg 53.1), changepoint at P8 confirmed by 3 periods of sustained high demand and massive stockouts (P10: 131 lost sales). Pipeline: 276 in-transit (P7:67 due P11, P8:3/P12, P9:98/P13, P10:108/P14), all on promised LT=4 schedule, no losses/overdues. On-hand=0. L=default (confirmed LT=4 over 5 observations: P1-5,P2-6,P3-7,P4-8,P6-10). mu_hat=recent_N N=3 to capture new high-demand regime (backend:5*110.7\u2248553 base stock). sigma_hat=default (stable policy, recent std low ~20 vs all-history higher). Parameters boost base stock to ~553, order ~277 to cover rising demand vs pipeline avg~69/period, balancing q=0.5 service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: avg 110.7 (P8-10), +108% vs prior avg 53.1 (P1-7), sustained over 3 periods with stockouts.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29, late spring): Women's basic t-shirt demand remains in high regime since P8 (92,102,138,112; avg 111, +108% vs P1-7 avg 53), sustained over 4 periods with volatility. No calendar events spiking further, but seasonal spring demand for jerseys fits. Pipeline: 387 in-transit (P8:3 due P12, P9:98/P13, P10:108/P14, P11:178/P15); on-hand 0; no overdue arrivals or losses\u2014all observed LT=4 (latest P7->P11). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/vol (backend: mu_hat=5*111=555, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*std_recent~high), L=default=4; OR backend targets base_stock ~ mu_hat + z*sigma_hat (z~0.5 since profit=holding=1), caps appropriately, ensuring coverage for 5 periods despite stockouts.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6), approaching Mother's Day (5/12/2019) which may boost demand for women's t-shirts. High demand regime since P8 (92,102,138,112,127; avg 114.2, +115% vs P1-7 avg 53.1), sustained 5 periods with consistent stockouts (P9-12 ended at 0). All 7 observed lead times exactly 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, etc., up to P8->P12); no losses or drifts. In-transit 528 matches expected P9(98)+P10(108)+P11(178)+P12(144), arriving P13-P16. On-hand 0, so order to cover elevated demand over 1+L=5 periods (~570 mean). recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures sustained high regime/volatility (std~18.6); default L=4 reliable. Balances high service (q=0.5) vs holding by targeting recent mean, avoiding overstock on early low-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Demand high regime extended P8-12: avg 114.2 (+115% vs P1-7 53.1), sustained 5 periods with demands >90 each and stockouts.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14, 2019/5/13 mid-spring; Nora women's t-shirt (everyday basics) aligns with seasonal apparel demand increase. High demand regime sustained P8-P13 (92,102,138,112,127,96; avg 111.2, +109% vs P1-7 avg 53.1), regime length 6 periods confirmed by consistent >90 demands and prior carry-overs. L=4 consistently observed (latest P9->P13; prior P1-8 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods, no losses/overdues). On-hand=2 low, in-transit=473 (P10-13 orders:108+178+144+43) covers ~4x recent avg but tight for L+1=5 periods (~556). recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures elevated mean/vol (~111, std~16.6); default L uses promised=4 matching actuals. Balances q=0.5 service (profit=holding=$1) by inflating base stock via recent high stats, preventing stockouts in high regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand high regime extended P8-13: avg 111.2 (+109% vs P1-7 53.1), sustained 6 periods with demands 92-138 and ongoing stockouts.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20): Late spring/early summer; Nora women's t-shirt demand remains in high regime (P8-14 avg ~107, sustained 7 periods per carry-over, +109% vs P1-7 avg 53; recent P11-14: 112/127/96/82 still above prior means despite P14 dip). No calendar events immediate (Memorial Day US ~5/27 may boost apparel). Pipeline healthy: in-transit 446 = P11:178(due P15)+P12:144(P16)+P13:43(P17)+P14:81(P18); all prior orders arrived exactly L=4 (confirmed multiple times). On-hand 28 low vs ~100 demand. L=default (promised 4, matches all observations). mu_hat=recent_7 ((1+4)*mean P8-14 ~107 \u2192 ~535, captures sustained high regime). sigma_hat=recent_7 (high recent vol ~20-30, sqrt(5)*std_last7 ensures safety stock for variability/stockouts).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27): Late spring/early summer; Nora T-shirt (women's jersey basic) demand seasonally supported, near Memorial Day (5/27) potentially mild uplift. High demand regime since P8 sustained (P8-P15: 92,102,138,112,127,96,82,85; avg 104.25, +95% vs P1-P7 avg 53.1), length 8 periods, recent dip P14-P15 (82,85) not yet sustained (only 2 periods). LT consistently 4 (latest: P11\u2192P15). On-hand 121 sufficient short-term; pipeline 329 (P12:144\u2192P16, P13:43\u2192P17, P14:81\u2192P18, P15:61\u2192P19) covers expected. No overdue/lost shipments. Use default L (promised=4 confirmed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_8 for regime (N=8=max(min(8,20),3)), mu_hat~(1+4)*104.25=521 targets base stock for high demand/service; sigma_hat sqrt(5)*std(recent) accounts volatility, balances q=0.5 (z~0) profit-holding.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3): Early summer, women's basic t-shirt demand likely sustained high due to seasonal warmth. Recent demands P8-16 (9 periods) avg 103 (high regime confirmed in carry-over, stable vs prior peaks ~110 with recent P13-16 avg~90 but overall sustained). Pipeline 257 matches expected P13:43 (due P17), P14:81(P18), P15:61(P19), P16:72(P20); no losses/overdues, all prior arrivals confirmed L=4. On-hand 169 covers immediate. Use recent_9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high demand regime (changepoint P8, length=9 periods, N=9); default L=4 confirmed consistently. This sets mu_hat=5*103=515, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*~20\u224845, balancing service (high recent mean) vs holding (profit=holding=1, q=0.5) with cap awareness.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10): Early summer for women's basic t-shirt; demand likely sustained high due to seasonal warmth. High demand regime from P8-P17 confirmed (10 periods, avg 104.3 vs P1-7 avg 53.1, +96%; demands 82-138). Recent P14-17 avg 94.4 still well above baseline. All observed lead times exactly 4 periods (latest: P13 order arrived P17). Pipeline 305 units (P14:81\u2192P18, P15:61\u2192P19, P16:72\u2192P20, P17:91\u2192P21) covers ~4 periods at 100 avg; on-hand 99 sufficient short-term, no overdue/losses. L= default (matches all observations). mu_hat/sigma_hat= recent_10 (regime_length=10>3, captures sustained high mean/volatility). Ensures backend base_stock ~104*5=520 + safety, minus pipeline ~300 \u2192 modest order to avoid stockouts/holdings (q=0.5 balanced).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/6/17, mid-June summer peak for women's jersey t-shirts, everyday basics likely seeing sustained high demand). Demand high regime since P8 changepoint (11 periods P8-P18: avg ~109, demands 92-160, multiple >100, stockouts earlier) vs early avg~53; recent P14-P18 avg107, P16-P18 avg123 with P18 spike to 160 fitting summer seasonality. Lead times confirmed consistently 4 periods across 10+ observations (latest P14->P18). On-hand 20 low vs recent demand~110-160, in-transit 342 covers ~3 periods at recent mean; expected P19 arrival=61 (P15 order), total start~81 likely partial coverage. No overdue/missing shipments. L=default (promised 4 stable). mu_hat=recent_N N=11 captures sustained high regime mean *(1+4). sigma_hat=recent_N N=11 for matching volatility (std higher in regime). With q=0.5 (z=0), targets base_stock=5*~109=~545; current pipeline 362 implies order ~183 (helps cover LT+1=5 periods post-spike), cap accommodates via sigma.

Carry-over insight: Demand high summer regime extended P8-P18: avg 109 (+105% vs P1-7 53), sustained 11 periods with 92-160 demands and P18=160 confirming seasonality.

Lead times consistently 4 periods (P1-P15 orders all arrived exactly LT=4, no losses). In-transit 430 = P16:72 (due P20) + P17:91 (P21) + P18:118 (P22) + P19:149 (P23), on track. On-hand=0 risks P20 stockout (expected demand ~110 > arrival 72). Changepoint at P8 (high regime length=12). Set L default (promised/confirmed 4); mu_hat recent_12 ((1+4)*109.5~548); sigma_hat recent_12 (elevated vol) to target base_stock ~ \u03bc\u0302 + 0*\u03c3\u0302 (q=0.5) covering 5 periods high demand, minimizing holding on excess while preventing further stockouts.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1), summer peak for women's T-shirt (Nora T-shirt, everyday basics). High demand regime P8-P20 sustained 13 periods, avg 109.5 (sum 1423/13), demands 82-160 consistent with seasonal summer demand (P18=160, P20=109). No stock in hand (0), in-transit 476 (P17:91\u2192P21, P18:118\u2192P22, P19:149\u2192P23, P20:118\u2192P24), covers ~4 periods at 109 avg. Lead times all confirmed 4 periods (multiple obs, e.g., P16\u2192P20). Use default L=4 (promised/confirmed). mu_hat recent_13 captures sustained high regime (+105% vs P1-7). sigma_hat recent_13 for recent volatility. Ensures OR targets base_stock ~109*5=545 (L+1=5), bridging pipeline shortage, balancing service vs holding (q=0.5).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22, 2019-07-08 (summer Monday), Nora women's T-shirt: high seasonal demand regime sustained P8-P21 (14 periods, avg demand 107 vs early 53, +102%; recent P18-21: 160/111/109/82 confirms summer highs with variance). No changepoint; P21=82 dip single-period, not sustained shift. Lead time consistently 4 periods (all 15+ confirmed arrivals P5-P21 from P1-P17 orders). Pipeline: 457 in-transit (P18:118 due P22, P19:149 P23, P20:118 P24, P21:72 P25; totals ~110*4=440 expected, no losses/overdues). On-hand=9 low, but P22 arrival covers. Use recent_14 for mu/sigma to capture high mean/var regime (mu_hat=5*107=535; sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*recent_std~high for safety). L=default (matches confirmed 4). Ensures base_stock targets service for summer demand while capping overstock (holding=profit).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15), mid-summer peak for women's t-shirts (Nora T-shirt, everyday basics). High demand regime since P8 (2019/4/1) sustained P8-P22 (15 periods, avg ~104, +105% vs P1-7 avg 53), confirmed by carry-over and demands 92-160 with recent P19-22 avg 90 still elevated despite P22=59 dip (not sustained <3 periods). No changepoint for drop. On-hand 68 covers current demand; in-transit 411 exactly matches expected P19=149 (arr P23), P20=118 (P24), P21=72 (P25), P22=72 (P26) at L=4, no losses/overdues. Total pipeline 479 ~4.8 periods at avg 100. Use default L (confirmed=4). recent_15 mu_hat/sigma_hat captures sustained summer high mean/variance (backend: mu_hat=5*~104=520; sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*std~15-20, base_stock~520 balances q=0.5 service vs holding, orders ~40 to top up).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22), mid-summer for women's jersey T-shirt; high demand regime from P8 (2019-04-01) sustained through P23 (16 periods, avg ~104 vs P1-7 avg 53.1, +96%), evidenced by consistent 80-160 demands except single P22 dip to 59 (not sustained, P23=101 recovery). No calendar events immediate, but summer seasonality supports continued high demand. Lead times confirmed 4 periods consistently (e.g., P19 order arrived P23; all observed P1-P19 orders on time, no losses). On-hand=116, in-transit=305 (P20:118 + P21:72 + P22:72 + P23:43, all due on time). Parameters use L default (promised/confirmed 4); recent_16 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=16, N=16>=3) to base forecast on sustained high regime mean/volatility, ensuring base_stock covers ~5 periods high demand (~520) while capping avoids excess holding amid profit=holding=1.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29), late July summer peak for women's jersey T-shirt (everyday basics); high demand regime since P8 (April onward, aligning with spring/summer seasonality) sustained through P24 with avg ~107 (P8-P24: 17 periods, recent P24=152 high, P22=59 dip but overall 92-160 range confirms). Lead time consistently 4 periods (all 20+ observations, e.g., P20->P24). On-hand 82 + in-transit 287 covers multiple high-demand periods (no overdue/lost shipments). Use recent_N N=17 (regime length P8-P24=17 periods, max(17,3)) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to weight high summer regime vs early low demands; L default (matches confirmed actual). This raises base_stock target ~5x107=535 mean demand over L+1=5, balancing profit=1 vs holding=1 with z=q/(q+h)=0.5, while cap limits overorder; adapts OR to regime without explicit forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand high summer regime extended P8-P24: avg 107 (+104% vs P1-7 53), sustained 17 periods with demands 59-160 (P24=152 confirming peak despite P22 dip).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5), early August summer peak for women's jersey t-shirt; high demand regime (P8-P25, 18 periods, avg ~107, +104% vs P1-7 avg 53) sustained with recent demands 59-152 (P22-25: 59,101,152,93 still within regime despite volatility). No overdue/missing shipments; all observed arrivals (P1-P21 orders) confirmed L=4 exactly. Pipeline 365 (P22-25 orders:72+43+100+150) + on-hand 61 ample coverage. L=default (promised/actual 4). mu_hat=recent_18 for regime mean ~107*(1+4)=535 to target base stock at expected 5-period demand. sigma_hat=recent_18 captures high volatility (std ~30) for cap, ensuring orders balance stockouts vs holding (q=0.5, z=0 so safety neutral).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12, mid-summer peak for women's basic t-shirts). High summer demand regime sustained P8-P26 (19 periods, avg ~106, +103% vs P1-7 avg 53), with recent P22-26: 59(dip),101,152,93,98 (avg 100.6) confirming ongoing high despite minor dip. All arrivals confirm L=4 exactly (latest P26: P22 order, no losses). Pipeline=398 covers exactly P23-26 orders (43+100+150+105), arriving P27-30; on-hand=35 low vs ~100 demand. Use recent_19 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/vol across (1+4)=5 periods (~530 mean demand), balancing stockouts vs holding (q=0.5). L=default (matches confirmed 4).

Carry-over insight: Demand high summer regime extended P8-P26: avg 106 (+103% vs P1-7 53), sustained 19 periods with demands 59-160 (P26=98, P24=152 confirming peak despite P22 dip).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019/8/19), late summer for women's Nora T-shirt. High summer demand regime P8-P27 sustained ~20 periods, avg ~102 (last 20 demands P8-P27), +96% vs P1-7 avg 53, with peaks 152-160 and dips P22=59/P27=51 but overall avg holds high vs early periods. Pipeline=478 (on-hand 27 + in-transit 451) covers ~5 periods at ~96 demand/period. Lead time consistently 4 periods (last 5+ arrivals: P23-P27 all 4 periods delay). Use recent_N=20 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/vol regime (changepoint P8, regime_length=20); backend computes mu_hat=(1+4)*mean_last20 ~510, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*std_last20 reflecting summer volatility. With z=0 (q=0.5), base_stock=mu_hat, expects order~510-478=32 (low to avoid excess holding as demand may dip post-peak). L=default (confirmed=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand high summer regime extended P8-P27: avg 102 (+96% vs P1-7 53), sustained 20 periods with demands 51-160 (P27=51 dip but avg holds, peaks P24=152/P18=160).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent 20 periods (P9-P28) capture regime: avg ~100, high volatility (std elevated by 160/152/138 highs). On-hand 64 + in-transit 388 (P25=150/P26=105/P27=96/P28=37 orders, all on 4-period schedule, no losses/overdues). L default (promised 4 confirmed consistently, latest P28 arrive from P24). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=20 (regime_length=20, max per guidelines) uses last 20 demands for (1+4)=5x recent high mean/vol to boost base_stock/service vs holding cost, preventing stockouts like P8-P28 while capping overstock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2), early September post-Labor Day weekend; Nora women's t-shirt demand declining seasonally from summer peak as fall approaches. Confirmed high summer regime P8-P26 avg ~106, but recent P27-29: 51/63/68 avg 60.7 (-41% vs summer), sustained 3 periods evidencing post-summer shift (P24=152 peak, then dips). On-hand 146 + in-transit 294 (P26:105/P27:96/P28:37/P29:56, all due on schedule L=4: P30-P33) covers ~6 periods at recent avg 60-75. Lead times consistently 4 periods (latest P25->P29), no losses/overdues. Use recent_N=5 (P25-29 demands 93/98/51/63/68 avg 74.6 \u2192 mu_hat=373) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to lower base stock vs default (all-history low mean), reducing holding costs amid softening demand while covering (L+1)=5 periods; q=0.5 targets median for profit=holding=1 balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to post-summer decline at P27: avg 60.7 (P27-29:51/63/68), -41% vs summer P8-P26 avg 106, sustained 3 periods confirming seasonal drop for t-shirts into September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9): Post-summer decline for women's t-shirt confirmed and extended (September, cooling demand as fall approaches). Recent demands P27-30: 51/63/68/40, avg 55.5 (-48% vs summer P8-26 avg 106), changepoint at P27 with regime length 4 periods (sustained drop, low vol). On-hand 211 + in-transit 189 (P27=96/P28=37/P29=56/P30=0, all on schedule for L=4 arrivals P31-34) covers ~8 periods at 55 demand. L default (consistent 4 periods observed, e.g., P26 order arrived P30). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=4 to use post-summer regime (backend: mu=5*55.5=277.5, sigma=sqrt(5)*~12.6), balances lower mean/vol vs holding costs (q=0.5), avoids overstock from summer params.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer decline extended P27-P30: avg 55.5 (-48% vs summer P8-P26 106), sustained 4 periods (51/63/68/40 confirming drop into September for t-shirts).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16), mid-September, t-shirt demand in sustained post-summer decline regime (carry-over P27-P30 avg55.5), now extending with P31=32 (recent P27-31:51/63/68/40/32 avg50.8, -52% vs summer P8-P26 avg106), normal seasonal drop for women's jersey t-shirts into fall. Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods (e.g., P31 arrive from P27 order, P30 from P26). On-hand 275 + in-transit93 (P28=37/P29=56/P30=0/P31=0, all on schedule, no losses/overdues) =368 covers >7 periods at 50/wk demand. High inventory risks holding cost ($1/unit/period). Changelpoint at P27 sustained 5 periods. Set L=default (promised/confirmed 4); mu_hat=recent_5 (5*(50.8)=254 for 1+L periods); sigma_hat=recent_5 (recent vol ~15 matches low regime). Lowers base_stock~254 (q=0.5,z~0), expects order~0 to minimize holding while covering demand, backend cap irrelevant.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer decline extended P27-P31: avg 50.8 (-52% vs summer P8-P26 106), sustained 5 periods (51/63/68/40/32 confirming ongoing fall drop for t-shirts).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23), late September, post-summer for women's t-shirt (Nora T-shirt, everyday basics). Carry-over confirms post-summer decline regime P27-P32: demands 51/63/68/40/32/28, avg 47 (-56% vs summer P8-P26 avg 106), deepening drop into fall. On-hand 284 + in-transit 56 (likely P29 order=56 arriving P33) = 340 pipeline, ample vs recent avg 47/period. Lead time consistently 4 periods (latest P28 order arrived P32, no losses/overdues). Use default L=4 (confirmed stable). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_6 (regime_length=6 >=3, captures decline changepoint at P27 sustained 6 periods). Backend base_stock ~47*5 + z*sigma*sqrt5, low mu reduces overstock/holding given high inventory and dropping demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer decline extended/deepened P27-P32: avg 47 (-56% vs summer P8-P26 106), sustained 6 periods (51/63/68/40/32/28, P32=28 confirms continued fall drop for t-shirts into late Sep).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30, late Sep into early Oct): Nora T-shirt in post-summer decline regime per carry-over (P27-P32 avg 47, -56% vs summer P8-P26 avg106). P33 demand=46 fits low regime (51/63/68/40/32/28/46), avg P27-P33=46.9 sustained 7 periods confirming fall drop for basic t-shirts as weather cools (no Halloween spike expected for everyday jersey). On-hand=294 high (covers ~6 periods at 47/demand), in-transit=0 (no orders P30-P33, all prior arrives confirmed LT=4). Lead time consistent 4 periods (multiple confirms). Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low demand/volatility regime (mean~47, std~14); L=default (promised 4, matches observed). Parameters target base_stock~(1+4)*47=235 adjusted by z=0 (q=1/(1+1)=0.5), balancing low demand vs holding cost; high on-hand reduces order-up-to need.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer decline extended P27-P33: avg 46.9 (-56% vs summer P8-P26 106), sustained 7 periods (51/63/68/40/32/28/46 confirming ongoing fall drop for t-shirts into late Sep/early Oct).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7, early October): T-shirt demand in continued post-summer decline regime into fall; P34 demand=22 (lowest yet), recent P27-P34 demands [51,63,68,40,32,28,46,22] avg=43.75 (-59% vs summer P8-P26 avg106), deepening drop confirmed. On-hand=272 sufficient for 6+ periods at recent avg (no stockouts needed), in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (P34 arrived=0 as expected from P30 order=0; prior arrivals confirm L=4). Use L=default (stable confirmed 4 periods). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=8 (regime_length=8>=3, captures low mean/vol post-changepoint P27). Lowers OR base_stock ~219 (5*43.75) +0*z*sigma (q=0.5,z~0) to match low demand, minimizing holding on excess 272 inventory while covering pipeline gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer decline extended/deepened P27-P34: avg 43.8 (-59% vs summer P8-P26 106), sustained 8 periods (51/63/68/40/32/28/46/22, P34=22 confirms ongoing fall drop for t-shirts into early Oct).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14), mid-October fall season for women's basic t-shirt; post-summer demand decline continues with P35 demand=23 (low), extending P27-P35 regime avg=41.4 (-61% vs summer P8-P26 avg=106). No in-transit (0), on-hand=249 high vs recent demand (~20-40/period), arrived=0 in P34/P35 matches ordered=0 in P30/P31 (no losses/overdues). Lead time consistently 4 periods (multiple confirms). Use recent_N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained decline regime (regime_length=9 >=3, cap20); L default (confirmed=4). This lowers mu_hat~(1+4)*41.4=207, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*std_recent9~sqrt5*17.4~39 (std calc: var of [51,63,68,40,32,28,46,22,23]~303, std~17.4), base_stock~207 + 0*39=207 (z=0,q=0.5); with pipeline~249>207, orders~0 avoiding overstock while prepared for future; addresses no missing shipments (consistent LT).

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer decline extended/deepened P27-P35: avg 41.4 (-61% vs summer P8-P26 106), sustained 9 periods (51/63/68/40/32/28/46/22/23, P35=23 confirms ongoing fall/winter drop for t-shirts into mid-Oct).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21), late October, women's t-shirt demand in post-summer decline regime into winter (t-shirts less relevant). P36 demand=21 continues low trend. Decline regime P27-P36 (10 periods): demands 51/63/68/40/32/28/46/22/23/21, avg=39.4 (-63% vs summer P8-P26 avg106), recent P33-P36 avg=23 confirms deepening winter lows. On-hand=228 covers >10 periods at avg39 or 20+ at recent23; in-transit=0, no overdue (last arrivals P33 from P29 LT=4, all recent LT=4 confirmed). Changepoint at P27 sustained 10 periods (N=10). Use L default (promised=4, matches all observed); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_10 to forecast low mean/volatility over 1+L=5 periods (~197 mu, low sigma), balancing low holding vs service in low-demand winter; OR backend's base_stock/q will order conservatively given high on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer decline extended/deepened P27-P36: avg 39.4 (-63% vs summer P8-P26 106), sustained 10 periods with recent P33-P36 avg 23 (46/22/23/21) confirming winter lows for t-shirts into late Oct.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Late October, women's basic t-shirt in deep post-summer/winter demand decline regime per carry-over insights (sustained 11+ periods from P27). Recent demands P27-P37 avg 38.9 (range 21-68), with deepening lows P34-P37 avg 25 (22/23/21/34). P37=34 fits continued low winter pattern for t-shirts. On-hand=194 covers 5-8 periods at ~25-40 demand, no in-transit/pipeline (recent orders=0 in P34-P37, all prior arrivals confirmed on-time at L=4, no losses). No overdue shipments. Use default L=4 (confirmed stable). recent_N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures sustained decline regime (changepoint P27 sustained 11 periods, N=11), yielding mu_hat~5*38.9=194.5 (matches current on-hand), sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*std~sqrt(5)*16 (high early variance in regime). Lowers base stock vs default/all-history (inflated by summer peaks ~106 avg), promotes minimal ordering to cut holding costs while covering low demand, balancing q=0.5 service.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer decline extended/deepened P27-P37: avg 38.9 (-61% vs summer P8-P26 avg106), sustained 11 periods (51/63/68/40/32/28/46/22/23/21/34), recent P34-P37 avg25 confirming deep winter lows for t-shirts into late Oct.

On-hand 176 + in-transit 1 (from P38 order=1) = 177 pipeline, no overdue/missing shipments (recent arrived=0 due to zero orders P30-P37; all prior arrived exactly after 4 periods). Recent changepoint at P34: deepened winter lows avg 23.6 (P34-P38:22/23/21/34/18, std~6.1), -50% vs early decline P27-P33 avg~47, sustained 5 periods confirming seasonal drop into Nov (t-shirts minimal in winter). L stable at 4 (many confirms). Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low regime: mu_hat=5*23.6=118, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*6.1\u224813.6; with z=0 (q=0.5), base_stock\u2248118 <177 pipeline \u2192 order\u22480, minimizes holding on excess inv while covering low future demand over 5 periods.

Use default L (confirmed 4). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_6 on winter lows regime (N=6=max(min(6,20),3)) to lower base stock, reduce holding on excess inventory while covering low demand over L+1=5 periods (~114 mu_hat). Balances q=0.5 service vs holding by anchoring to evidenced low regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18): mid-November, deep winter season for women's basic t-shirts with continued low demand expected (no Thanksgiving/Black Friday spike for basics). Recent demands P34-P40 (9/30-11/11): 22/23/21/34/18/19/10 avg=21, confirming deepened post-summer decline regime (carry-over P34-P38 avg23.6 sustained5, now extended lower). Regime length=7 periods. No overdue/missing shipments; all observed lead times=4 (latest P33 arrive from P29). Pipeline=147 on-hand +1 in-transit=148 covers 5-period (L+1) demand ~105. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to track low regime (mu_hat=5*21=105; sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*std_recent~ recent std~6 => ~13), z=0 (p=h=1,q=0.5) so base_stock~105, order~0 to minimize holding on excess inventory while covering low demand/volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand winter lows further deepened P38-P40: avg 15.7 (18/19/10), -33% vs P34-P37 avg 25, sustained 3 periods confirming deep winter bottom for t-shirts into early-mid Nov.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Late November, Monday before Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29); t-shirt demand in deep winter lows regime (carry-over Period 41: P38-P40 avg 15.7 sustained 3 periods), extended by P41=14 (P38-P41 avg 15.25). On-hand 133 + in-transit 1 (P38 order=1, expected L=4 arrival during P42) = pipeline 134, covers >>5 periods of ~15 demand/period (~75 total). No overdue/lost shipments; all historical arrivals confirmed L=4. Use L default (promised/confirmed 4). mu_hat recent_N=4 (changelpoint P38 deepening to winter lows, regime_length=4>=3 sustained, N=max(min(4,20),3)=4; last 4 demands avg~15.25, *5=76.25). sigma_hat recent_N=4 (low vol in regime ~3.6, *sqrt(5)~8). With q=0.5 z=0, base_stock~mu_hat=76; pipeline 134>>76 ensures order=0, minimizes holding on excess while safe for low demand; no holiday spike evidence yet despite dates.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02), early December, deep winter for women's basic t-shirt with no evidence of Christmas demand spike (recent demands P38-P42: 18/19/10/14/25 avg 17.2, consistent with carry-over winter lows avg ~15-25). On-hand 109, in-transit 0, no overdue/missing shipments (latest P38 order arrived P42, LT=4 confirmed). Expected demand next 5 periods ~86 (17.2*5), <109 coverage, so low mu_hat promotes order~0 to deplete excess inventory amid high holding costs, minimizing R_t penalty while covering low-demand regime. L default (promised=4, consistently observed). No changepoint; recent_5 captures sustained winter lows (regime_length>5, cap20). Sigma recent_5 reflects low volatility std~5.6, sqrt(5)*5.6~12.6 for cap safety.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09), deep winter for women's t-shirt basics; low demand regime sustained P34-P43 (10 periods, demands 22/23/21/34/18/19/10/14/25/10, avg 19.6) confirming continued winter lows into early December ahead of holidays (no uptick evidence yet, P43=10 low post P42=25). High on-hand 99 vs low demand (~20/period) covers >4 periods; in-transit 0, no overdue (last arrival P42 from P38 LT=4, consistent). Use recent_N N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect low mean/volatility regime (backend: mu_hat=19.6*5\u224898, sigma_hat\u22487.2*sqrt(5)\u224816 low), default L=4 confirmed stable; lowers base_stock to minimize holding cost on excess inventory while covering LT+1 demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16), deep winter for women's t-shirt (Nora T-shirt, everyday basics). Carry-over confirms post-summer decline deepened to winter lows (P38-P40 avg15.7 sustained 3+; extended P38-P44 demands 18/19/10/14/25/10/7 avg14.7, sustained 7 periods with recent P42=25 Thanksgiving bump then drop to P44=7 confirming lows into mid-Dec). Pre-Christmas but t-shirts show no holiday spike signal (demands declining), expect ~15/period. On-hand=92 covers >6 periods, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical arrivals confirmed L=4, e.g., P38 order arrived P42). Parameters: default L (stable 4 periods observed consistently). mu_hat recent_N N=7 (changelpoint winter lows P38+, regime_length=7 sustained, backend (1+4)*14.7\u224873.5 mean). sigma_hat recent_N N=7 (low vol in regime, std~6.4 recent). Lowers base_stock=mu_hat (q=0.5,z=0) +z*sigma to ~73, matching low demand to cut holding on excess 92 while covering 5 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23, Christmas week). T-shirt demand in deep winter lows, no holiday spike evident (P42=25 possible Thanksgiving bump, then P43-45:10/7/13 avg10). Recent 10 periods (P36-45) demands avg 17.1 (21/34/18/19/10/14/25/10/7/13), std~8.1, confirming sustained post-summer decline/deep winter regime (19+ periods total decline, recent deepening). On-hand=79 covers ~4-5 periods low demand; in-transit=0, no overdue (consistent L=4 arrivals, last P42 from P38). Use default L=4 (confirmed). mu_hat recent_10: backend (1+4)*17.1=85.5 targets base stock ~85 (z=0 since q=0.5), orders ~6 to cover, minimizing holding while avoiding stockout. sigma_hat recent_10 for low vol. Christmas date anticipates no t-shirt surge (winter garment), parameters balance low mu/vol for low holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand winter lows further deepened P43-P45: avg 10 (10/7/13), -42% vs P38-P42 avg 17.2 (18/19/10/14/25), sustained 3 periods with no Christmas pre-spike (P45=13 on 12/16) confirming deep winter bottom for t-shirts into late Dec.

Nora T-shirt (women's jersey basic) in deep winter lows regime per carry-over (P43-P45 avg10, no Christmas spike; P46=15 slight stabilization but sustained low ~11). Recent demands P43-46:10/7/13/15 (avg11.25, std~3.3 confirming low vol). On-hand=64 covers ~6 periods demand, in-transit=7 (P46 order arriving P50). No overdue/lost shipments; LT consistently 4. Use default L (promised/confirmed 4). mu_hat recent_N=4 (regime_length=4 sustained winter bottom P43-46, backend (1+4)*11.25=56.25 low to match decline, reduce overstock risk). sigma_hat recent_N=4 (low vol sqrt(5)*3.3~7.4, tightens base_stock for holding cost balance).
