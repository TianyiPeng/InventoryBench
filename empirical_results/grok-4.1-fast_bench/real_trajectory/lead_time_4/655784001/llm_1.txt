Winter/early spring transition, trousers relevant. (b) Demand regime: Historical weekly data shows initial high (256, 241 in early Jan), sharp drop to 112 (Jan 21/28), further to 81 (Feb 4). Recent regime (last 3 periods): avg ~102, declining trend - forecast ~80-110/period, conservative 100 avg. No sustained new regime vs historical seed. (c) Lead time: No concluded periods yet; promised 4 periods. No in-transit to assess delays/losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0, in-transit 0 - fully depleted, period 1 demand will be lost. No arrivals expected this period. (e) Final order logic: Base forecast 100/period. Cover current period + lead time 4 + 1 safety = 600 units total need. But declining trend + holding cost ($1/period vs $4 profit) \u2192 order conservatively 300 to initiate pipeline, build ~3 periods coverage, adjust next periods based on outcomes.
