  "rationale": "(a) Product: Women's everyday basic short-sleeved fitted jersey T-shirt ('Billie'). Date 2019-02-11 (Monday, early February, winter in Northern Hemisphere). Short-sleeved T-shirt demand typically steady for basics but potentially softer in winter; Valentine's Day (Feb 14) upcoming, minor possible uplift for women's apparel. Historical data (prior 5 weeks ending 2019-02-04): 113,141,104,173,134 \u2192 avg 133/period, consistent no strong seasonal signal yet. (b) Demand regime: Steady at ~133/period (std dev ~28), no sustained shifts (all within 104-173). Use as forecast baseline. (c) Period 1: No prior orders/concludes, cannot infer actual LT (promised=4) or losses. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; empty pipeline. Period 1 demand will be unsatisfied (post-decision). (e) Forecast 133/period. Order to cover P1-P5 demand (current + LT=4 pipeline fill) before steady-state: 133\xd75=665. Round up to 700 for initial safety stock (low holding $1 vs profit $4; prioritize avoiding multi-period stockouts in 47-period horizon).",

Replenishes pipeline post-P5, balances lost sales risk ($4 profit) vs holding ($1/period). Avoid overstock (700 excess post-P5 covers ahead).",
