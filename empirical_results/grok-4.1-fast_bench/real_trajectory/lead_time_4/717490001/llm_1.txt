(c) Lead time: promised 4 periods, no conclude messages to infer actual (first period). No missing orders. (d) Inventory: on-hand 0, in-transit 0; pipeline empty, Periods 1-4 will stockout regardless. (e) Order logic: Initial pipeline fill to cover lead time +1 period demand (~60/wk *5=300).

Expect demand spike ~150-200 despite recent low winter weeks (P43-45 avg~44), as holiday gifting/last-minute buys boost casual apparel; confirmed seasonal via carry-over (summer peaks, Labor Day spike, BF rebound).\n(b) Demand regimes per carry-over: post-BF decline to winter low P43-45 avg44 (-75% from P42 174); no new sustained shift (only 3 periods, P46 holiday likely disrupts).\n(c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (all recent arrivals confirm, e.g. P45 from P41); no overdue/missing orders (in-transit matches: P42=200, P43=200, P44=0, P45=0).\n(d) On-hand 269 (high); pipeline 400 (P46:+200, P47:+200, P48/P49:+0); total supply P46:469, covers 3x recent low or 2x holiday peak; excess building from prior high orders during low demand.\n(e) Order 0: ample coverage for P46-49+ even at holiday spike (e.g. 200/wk ends P49 ~100+); prioritize drawdown to cut holding costs ($1/unit/period) vs risk low post-holiday demand.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) World/product: Cat Tee T-shirt (basic jersey upper body garment). Date 2019-12-30: post-Christmas (P46=12/23), New Year's Eve eve; winter low season for T-shirts (cold weather reduces demand); no spikes expected vs summer/Labor Day peaks in carry-over. (b) Demand regime: Recent P43-P46 avg 41 (42,39,50,33) vs P37-P42 avg 129 (-68%), sustained 4 periods post-holiday slump; forecast P47 ~40 low winter demand. Historical winter (early P1-4 Feb-Mar ~80 avg) higher but recent Dec confirms deepening low regime. (c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods (all recent arrivals e.g. P46: P42 order; P45: P41; no losses/drift). No overdue/missing. (d) Inv & pipeline: On-hand 436; in-transit 200 (P43 order=200 arrives P47); post-arrival ~636 start P47. Next arrivals: P48-P50=0 (P44-46 orders=0); covers ~15 periods at 40/demand (636-40*4=476 pre-P51). High position vs low demand. (e) Order logic: Zero order to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period on ~500+ end-inv); ample coverage thru P50+; replenish later if demand rises; balances lost profit risk (low demand) vs high holding.",
