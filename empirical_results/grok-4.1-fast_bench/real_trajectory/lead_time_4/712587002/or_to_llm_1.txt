Demand analysis: Critically low sustained per carry-overs (P37-42 avg ~4/period: 3,1,4,1,1,15), with P42=15 as single uptick post-Thanksgiving (Nov25), but not sustained (prior avg ~2). Now Period 43 (Dec2, Cyber Monday 2019), entering holiday season; women's viscose-blend trousers (lightweight, trendy paper-bag waist, everyday collection) may see modest winter/holiday lift (shopping, fashion), but history shows no strong Dec precedent (early-year peak was Feb-Mar spring). Conservative expected demand: 10-20/period ramp (total ~75 over 5 periods), covered by 96. OR recommendation: 167 units reflects full-history mean (diluted ~40-50/period *5=200-250 base stock -96 pipeline \u2248167), but overestimates by ignoring sustained low-demand regime (late-year avg << early highs). Final strategy: Override OR drastically to 20 units - minimal hedge for potential modest holiday uptick (e.g., avg15-20/period), ensuring coverage without excess pipeline risking holding costs ($1/unit/period) on P47 arrival if demand stays subdued; prioritizes profit preservation over speculative buildup.",
