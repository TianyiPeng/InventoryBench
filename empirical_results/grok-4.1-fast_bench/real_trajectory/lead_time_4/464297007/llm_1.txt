Dec 16, 2019, mid-December peak holiday gifting season (Christmas Dec 25 in P46), Black Friday passed; expect sustained high demand for gifts ~350 avg, matching recent holiday pattern. (b) Demand regime: Holiday high regime continues P39-P44 avg 339 (241,387,348,311,266,380), volatile but elevated vs prior lows; aligns with carry-over P39-P41 325 resurgence into Christmas. (c) Lead time/missing: Consistent 4 periods (e.g., P40 order arrived P44; P41 arrives P45, etc.); no overdue/missing orders, all conclude on time. (d) Inv & pipeline: On-hand 332 covers partial P45; pipeline 1400 [P41:400 arr P45, P42:600 P46, P43:400 P47]. Projection (350 dem): P45 end~382, P46~632, P47~682 (no stockout); even 400 dem: P47 end~532. (e) Final order logic: Pipeline covers P45-P47 adequately (3 remaining periods /47 total); P45 order arrives P49 post-game (lost, no benefit/cost). Order 0 to avoid excess, optimize sold - holding.",

Post-Christmas P47 (12/30 NYE) ~350-400, then winter drop P48+ (1/6+) to ~250 (historical Jan avg 237, post-holiday decline pattern per carry-over). (b) Demand regime: Holiday high sustained P39-P45 avg 328 (consistent +182% vs prior low, no new shift - volatile but stable mean). Christmas-specific transient spike anticipated. (c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (e.g., P45 arr from P41, P44 from P40, etc. - all 'lead_time was 4'). No missing/lost orders (in-transit 1000 = P42:600 exp P46 + P43:400 exp P47).

Total visible supply 372+1000=1372 covers ~4 periods @340. (e) Order 400: Replenish pipeline for P50 (post-holiday ~250-300), build safety vs P49 risk/decline uncertainty. Matches recent holiday orders (P41-43:400/600/400), balances stockout loss vs holding (symmetric costs). Conservative for expected drop.",
