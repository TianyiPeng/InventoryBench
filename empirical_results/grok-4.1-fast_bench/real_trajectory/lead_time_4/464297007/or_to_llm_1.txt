Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 457 + in-transit 200 (solely Period 40 order=200, arriving Period 44; Periods 37-39 orders=0, so arrivals: P41=0, P42=0, P43=0, P44=200). Total position 657, thin pipeline risks stockouts in P42-P44 if demand stays high (e.g., 400/period depletes quickly post-P41). Demand analysis: Volatile regimes per carry-over; recent P38=115, P39=241, P40=387 (avg 248, +113% vs P35-37 avg 116); upward trend aligns with calendar - Period 41 (2019-11-18) nears Thanksgiving (11/28), Black Friday (11/29), Cyber Monday (12/02 in P43), driving lingerie/underwear demand surges (gifts/personal refresh).
