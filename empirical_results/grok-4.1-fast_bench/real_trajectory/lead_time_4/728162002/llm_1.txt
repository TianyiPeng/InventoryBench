Possible post-holiday normalization; forecast current/next periods ~15 (blending recent stability with historical avg 19).

Winter demand (Dec 30, 2019, post-Christmas/New Year's) extremely low for T-shirts due to cold weather; historical Jan 2019 avg~19 confirms seasonal trough. No upcoming events boosting T-shirt sales.

(c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (latest e.g., no recent orders but historical arrivals reliable, no missing shipments). No in-transit, nothing overdue. (d) Inventory: On-hand 434 (high, covers ~24 periods at 18/day); pipeline empty (in-transit=0). Holding cost $1/unit/period risks ~$434/period if unchanged. (e) Order 0: Avoid adding inventory during winter trough; deplete on-hand to minimize holding while covering low demand (safety via excess stock). Reassess in spring.",
