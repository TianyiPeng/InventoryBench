Seasonal: high demand winter/early spring (Feb-Mar avg~60 from P1-P4:51,97,58,44), sharp decline spring (P5-P16 avg~35), ultra-low summer trough (P17-P26 avg~14, deepening to ~10 mid-June to late-July then volatile 9,23,16 late July-early Aug). Now P27 (2019-08-12, mid-Aug): end of summer, pre-fall/back-to-school (late Aug-Sep), expect gradual demand uptick as weather cools/Labor Day (Sep2 ~P30), but still low regime near-term. (b) Demand regime: Ultra-low summer sustained P17-P26 avg14 (total sold P17-26: 13+15+3+1+7+19+10+9+23+16=116/10=11.6), recent P24-P26 (9,23,16 avg16) slight uptick/volatility vs mid-summer avg~9.7, not sustained shift (volatile, avg P17-26 only +20%). Forecast near-term (P27-P31): 15-20/period conservative (late summer trough tail). (c) Lead time: Confirmed stable 4 periods (last observed P4 order arrived P8); no in-transit, no orders since P4, no missing/lost shipments. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 470 (post-P26), covers 470/18\u224826 periods at recent avg18 or 23+ at 20/period; no in-transit. High buffer good for rising demand, drawing down slowly (P8 end 884 to P26 470, sold 414 over 18p avg23); holding $1/unit low vs profit $19. (e) Final order logic: Ample coverage for (L+1)=5 periods ahead (P27-P31 exp demand 75-100 <<470), no pipeline need yet; continue drawdown during low demand to minimize holding, monitor for sustained uptick before replenishing for fall ramp (order in future periods to arrive Sep+).",
