(b) Demand cycles: alternating high (~80-100) and low (~30-40) regimes; recent holiday surge P42-P44 (135,67,80 avg94), moderated P45-P46 (62,61 avg61.5, -35% from peak); fits post-holiday return to low regime (prior lows P38-P41 avg33, P15-P18 avg42); forecast P47-P50: ~40-60, conservative low-mean. No new sustained shift (P45-P46 drop not yet 3-period low confirmation). (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods across all arrivals (latest P46 none yet, P45 from P41); no missing/lost orders; in-transit 200 from P46 arrives P50. (d) On-hand 1036 covers ~17-25 periods at 40-60 demand; +200 in-transit P50 = excessive pipeline; ending inv P46=1036 incurs high holding ($1036/period). (e) Order 0 to minimize holding costs amid post-holiday demand drop; ample coverage through cycles; reassess if new high regime confirms.",
