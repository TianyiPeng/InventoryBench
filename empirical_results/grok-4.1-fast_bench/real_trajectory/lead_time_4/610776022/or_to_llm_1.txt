Demand analysis: Women's lightweight jersey basic T-shirt; Nov 11 (pre-Thanksgiving Nov28/Black Friday Nov29 in P42); history shows sustained decline from summer lows (~37 stabilized P28-33) to ~28 (P34-38) and now lower; no evidence of holiday spike yet (P39=8), early winter may not boost lightweight style significantly vs. heavier apparel; historical peaks were early year (Jan-Feb 200+), not Nov.
