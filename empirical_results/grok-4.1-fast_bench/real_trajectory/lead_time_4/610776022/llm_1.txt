(b) Demand regime: Historical weekly demand ramped from 53 (Jan7) to 233 (Feb4); recent 3 periods (222,242,233) avg 232, low variance (\xb110), confirms sustained high-demand regime vs early low.

(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0, in-transit 0; Period 1 demand fully unmet (lost sales). No arrivals expected soon.

Late April 2019 (P12: 4/29), spring season favors lightweight basics; recent Easter (4/21) may explain P11 demand spike to 291 (post-holiday clothing refresh); upcoming Mother's Day (5/12) could lift demand further. No major events immediate, but seasonal spring uptick likely vs. early-year hist (Jan-Feb avg ~176 ramp to 233). (b) Demand regimes: Late Feb high (P1-3 avg 299); March-early Apr low (P4-8 avg 221, -26% confirmed); recent P9-11 (173,206,291) avg 223, volatile but stable ~220-230 mean with P11 spike (single period, not sustained shift). Game hist overall avg ~238 (1776/11 recent + prior); forecast P12-P15 ~230-250 (spring bias + recent avg, buffer P11 uptick/Easter/Mother's). (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (all P1-7 orders arrived exactly P5-11: e.g., P7 order arrived P11); no missing orders/delays; next: P8(260) arrives P12, P9(240)/P13, P10(200)/P14; P11(0)/no P15 arrival. (d) On-hand 319 (covers P12 even at 400+ demand); total pipeline 319+700=1019 (~4.4wks at 230/wk); proj ending inv (assume 230/wk): P12~349, P13~359, P14~339, P15~119 (risky if 250+); P16 needs replenishment. (e) Order 240 for P16 arrival: matches recent regime avg 223 + spring safety (20-30 buffer for volatility/Mother's Day); avoids P15/P16 stockout (covers ~1wk demand post-P15 dip) while minimizing holding (profit=holding=1, high current pipeline justifies conservative qty vs. prior highs).",
