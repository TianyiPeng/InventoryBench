Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 4 periods across all recent concluded arrivals (e.g., P46: P42 order arrived lead_time=4; P45: P41=4; no losses or drifts observed, matching promised). Inventory analysis: On-hand=408 (high, from P46 ending after low demand=16); In-transit=250 (likely P43 order=250, arriving during P47 after decision). Covers far beyond expected low demand over L+1=5 periods (~35*5=175). Demand analysis: Sustained low regime per carry-over (deepening to P44-P46 avg=28, P46=16 post-Christmas); date 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas, pre-New Year's) unlikely to spike for ladies skinny ankle jeans (winter casual wear, holiday shopping over). Historical recent: P43-46 avg=35 (56,40,29,16), no rebound. OR recommendation=63 uses full history (pulled up by early highs ~200s), ignores recent deepening low/volatility and high pipeline; uncapped likely higher but capped. Strategy: Override to 0 - excess coverage (658 total post-P47 arrival vs ~175 need), profit=holding=1 prioritizes minimizing ending inventory/holding costs; no stockout risk.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR's 63 to 0 units - on-hand 408 + 250 in-transit (P43 order due P47) vastly exceeds sustained low demand (~35/period recent avg P43-P46, P46=16 post-Christmas); prioritize avoiding holding costs with profit=holding ratio.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Period 47: Demand low regime deepens post-Christmas: P44-P46 avg 28 (-33% vs P43-P45 avg 42); sustained 3 periods <40 (40,29,16) with no holiday rebound confirming continuation of prior low regime.",
