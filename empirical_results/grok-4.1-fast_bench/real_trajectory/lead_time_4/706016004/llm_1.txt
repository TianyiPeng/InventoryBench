No losses/delays.\n(d) Inv/pipeline: OH103 + IT190 (P39:70->43, P40:70->44, P41:0->45, P42:50->46)=293 total for P43-47. P43 supply:103+70=173. Cum to P45 end:243 (risk if 100/wk x3=300). P46 end:293 (4wks). Thin P45(0 arr), P46(50); stockout risk P45/46 if holiday 100+ sustained (cum 400+ >293), but P43/44 buffers strong.\n(e) Order logic: P43 order->P47 (last useful). Expect D47 ~70-100 post-Xmas. Order 100 covers forecast+safety (low hold risk $1/1p vs $4 lost sales). Balances stockouts (P47 start low if prior depletion) vs excess hold; net positive even if low demand.",
