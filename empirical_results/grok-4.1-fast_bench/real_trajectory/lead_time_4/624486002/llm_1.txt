Forecast P47: ~12-15. (c) Lead time: Confirmed stable 4 periods (all recent arrivals e.g. P22\u2192P26, P21\u2192P25); no in-transit, no overdue/lost orders (last order P22 arrived on time). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 1731 (P46 ending), in-transit 0; covers ~115 periods at 15/wk forecast (years ahead); no arrivals scheduled for P47-P50. (e) Order logic: Massive overstock vs. trough demand; order 0 to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while stock covers winter trough + next seasonal ramps (lead time 4 allows future ordering); profit=holding=1 prioritizes avoiding excess hold over minor stockout risk (none imminent).",
