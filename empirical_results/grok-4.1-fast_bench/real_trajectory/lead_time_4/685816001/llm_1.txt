Recent P42 (Nov25 Black Friday) spike 150 one-off, P43 (Dec2) 46 low aligns with winter norms.\n(b) Demand regime: Winter low sustained (P36-43 excl. P42 anomaly: avg ~58; P39-41/43: 64/30/38/46 avg 45); P43 46 confirms continuation post-P42 spike (not sustained). Forecast P44-47: ~45-60/period (total ~200-240), possible P46 Christmas modest uptick but <100 (no evidence of sustained holiday boost for t-shirts).\n(c) Lead time: Confirmed consistently 4 periods (all recent arrivals P38-P42: lead_time was 4); no drifts/losses (e.g., P40 order=80 arrives P44 as expected, no overdue).\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 95; in-transit 180 = P40:80 (arr P44), P41:0 (P45), P42:0 (P46), P43:100 (P47). Total supply for P44-47: 95+180=275 (> expected ~220 even with mild P46 uptick). Post-P44: ~175 start (95+80), ample coverage (covers 4x60=240 or 150+3x50=300 with minor risk).\n(e) Order logic: Pipeline/on-hand covers expected low winter demand + buffer for potential P46 holiday (~50% excess); game ends P47 (P44 order arrives P48 post-end, no value/risk); order 0 minimizes unnecessary pipeline amid break-even profit/holding.",

  "rationale": "(a) Product: RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT (men's basic cotton jersey round-neck, categorized under underwear/upper body garment).

Date 2019/12/16 (Mon), pre-Christmas rush (12/25 Wed in P46), but undershirt unlikely major gift/spike driver vs. fashion apparel; recent post-BF (P42 150 spike) settled to low ~47 (P43-44). (b) Demand regime: Winter low sustained (P40-44 excl. P42 outlier: 30/38/46/49 avg~41; full P40-44 avg~63); P43-44 avg47 continues post-holiday adjustment, no new 3+ period shift (P42 BF anomaly). Forecast P45 ~50-60 (winter baseline + modest pre-Xmas). (c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods (all recent arrivals confirm, e.g., P44 arrival from P40); no missing/overdue orders. In-transit 100 from P43 order, due P47. (d) Inv & pipeline: On-hand 126 covers ~2-3 periods at 50-60/wk (P45+P46 ~110-120); no P45/P46 arrivals; P47 +100 arrival. Ample vs. low winter forecast, low stockout risk even if P46 modest holiday bump (~100 max). High on-hand risks holding cost if demands stay <50. (e) Order logic: Order 0; new order arrives P49 post-game (47 periods total), adds no coverage value, risks unnecessary in-transit/holding if charged; current pipeline + on-hand optimizes coverage vs. cost for remaining P45-47.",
