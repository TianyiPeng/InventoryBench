(b) Demand: low regime sustained (carry-over P41-44 avg28, extended; recent P43-46:29/18/20/23 avg22.5, -20% vs P41-44, volatility low but mean stable ~25; no rebound signal post-P46=23). (c) Lead time: consistently 4 periods (all recent arrivals e.g. P40 ord->P44, P39->P43 confirm); no in-transit, no losses. (d) Inventory: on-hand=282 (high, from prior small orders/drawdown), covers ~11 periods at 25/unit; 0 pipeline - post-P40 no orders, arrivals complete. (e) Order logic: forecast ~25 for P47; excess inventory (282>>demand*5) incurs $282 holding this period alone (profit=sold only); order 0 to deplete stock, minimize holding vs service risk (low demand regime).",
