(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1 demand will be unmet (sales=0); pipeline empty, must build coverage for Periods 1-5 (~750-900 units naive, but conservative ramp-up). (e) Final order logic: Order 200 to initiate pipeline covering ~1-2 periods demand (avg 180) plus safety for lead time 4; avoids overhold (holding=$1 vs profit=$19); will arrive Period 5 (visible Period 6); increment based on future observes.",
