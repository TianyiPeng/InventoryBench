OR recommendation: 27 units (capped at ~mean 10.4 + 1.645\u03c3\u224826.8; uncapped base-stock ~89 ignored due to cap). Strategy: Follow OR's conservative cap for Period 1 to initiate pipeline without excess risk (low holding $1 vs profit $19 favors stock but cap prevents overcommit); upward trend suggests monitoring for future overrides.

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All historical arrivals (e.g., P46 no arrival yet, but prior like P5 arrived from P1 order lead_time=4, consistently across P5-P46 concludes) confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods; no lost shipments evident as in-transit=120 matches P46 order=120, expected P50 arrival. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=641 (from P46 ending), in-transit=120 (P46 order), total=761; recent demand P43-P46 avg=3.5 (8,2,3,1), very low sustained per carry-overs (14+ periods). Covers ~200+ periods at current demand rate. Demand analysis: Product is long-sleeve cotton shirt; date 2019/12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's - no expected demand surge (historical winter low continuation, no holiday spike as P46=1); sustained very low regime P36+ (avg~6 dropping to ~3.5). OR rec=0 uses historical demand/lead time but underestimates inventory buffer - agree fully, no need to order as holding cost $1 vs profit $19 irrelevant with excess stock. Strategy: Order 0 to minimize holding costs while buffer suffices for L+1=5 periods (~20 units needed).",
