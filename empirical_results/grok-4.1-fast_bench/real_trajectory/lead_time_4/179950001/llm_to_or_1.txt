Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11), first decision, on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no prior game history or conclude messages. Product: women's leather hip belt (accessories), mid-February near Valentine's but low seasonal relevance for belts. Historical demands (5 weeks to 2019-02-04): 105,62,72,48,36 showing decline; changepoint after first week (105 outlier?), recent regime last 4 weeks mean=54.5 (down 48% from 105), std~15.8 (lower vol). No lead time observations, use default L=4 (promised). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained lower demand regime (regime_length=4 >=3), informing backend mu_hat~(1+4)*54.5=272.5, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*15.8~35; with q=0.5 (profit=holding=1), z=0 so base_stock~mu_hat, avoids overstock from full-sample mean=64.6. Pipeline covers 0, orders to build for 5 periods demand post-decision.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift after 2019-01-07: avg decreased to 54.5 over last 4 historical periods (-48% from prior 105), lower variance confirmed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18), mid-February, no major calendar events for women's leather belts; demand remains low post-regime shift noted in carry-over (avg ~51.6 over last 5 samples: 62,72,48,36,40 including Period 1 demand=40). On-hand=0, in-transit=81 from Period 1 order (no arrivals expected yet, promised L=4 so arrives during Period 5). No lead times observed, no overdue shipments. Use recent_5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture sustained low demand mean/variance regime (changepoint after 2019-01-07, regime length=5); L=default (promised 4). This lowers base_stock target vs all-data default (mean~65), reducing overstock/holding risk while pipeline covers ~2+ periods demand at current levels, balancing q=0.5 service.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), late February post-Presidents' Day (Feb 18, P2 demand=87 likely holiday spike +60% vs recent avg ~54). Historical downshift confirmed (carry-over: avg 54.5 last 4 hist periods, -48% from 105), validated by P1 demand=40 fitting low regime; P2 spike not sustained. No arrivals yet normal (P1 order expected during P5 arrival, visible P6). On-hand=0, in-transit=158 from P1(81)+P2(77); target base stock ~(1+4)*54.5=272 to cover review+lead with lower mean, reducing overstock risk (q=0.5 balanced). recent_N=4 uses last 4 hist samples (62,72,48,36: mean=54.5, low std~16.7) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low regime, ignoring old high/outlier; L default (promised 4, no observed LTs).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, no major retail events or seasonality spikes for women's leather hip belts (steady accessory). Confirmed low demand regime post-2019-01-07 changepoint (carry-over): last 7 samples [62,72,48,36,40,87,57] avg=57.4 (down ~45% from 105), sustained over 7 periods with moderate variance. No lead-time observations yet (arrived=0 expected; P1 order due during P5). On-hand=0, pipeline=250 (P1:81+P2:77+P3:92), covers ~4 periods at current mean. Set L default (promised=4). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=7 (regime_length=7, max(min(7,20),3)=7) for lower mean/volatility adaptation vs. full historical. With q=0.5 (z=0), base_stock\u2248(5\xd757.4)=287; orders ~37 to reach it, minimizing holding while ensuring coverage; cap prevents excess.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11), early March, no major calendar events impacting women's belt demand. Recent game demands (P1-P4): 40,87,57,61 (mean=61.25, std\u224819.4); slightly higher mean than carry-over historical post-shift avg=54.5, with increased volatility. No concluded arrivals yet (first possible in P5 conclude next period for P1 order); in-transit=288 from P1-P4 orders exactly matches placed quantities, no losses evident. Pipeline covers ~4-5 periods at current mean. Default L (promised=4) as zero observed LTs. recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat uses most recent game demands post-historical shift (regime length=4), informing mu_hat\u22485*61.25=306, sigma_hat\u2248\u221a5*19.4\u224843; with q=0.5 (z*=0), base_stock=mu_hat, targets expected pipeline demand over L+1=5 periods while cap limits overorder. Balances stockouts vs holding at profit=holding=1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18, mid-March, no major holidays or seasonal spikes for women's leather belts). Demands: historical post-shift avg 54.5 (confirmed), game P1-5: 40,87,57,61,98 (avg 68.6, fluctuating but recent regime stable around 65-70, no new changepoint). Lead time: 1 observation (P1 order arrived P5, exactly 4 periods, matches promised; no overdue/lost shipments). Pipeline: 226 in-transit (P2:77, P3:92, P4:38, P5:19) covers ~3+ periods at recent avg. On-hand:0. Use default L (confirmed=4). mu_hat recent_5 (N=5, regime_length=5 game periods, mean~68.6 \xd75=343) to weight recent higher demands vs historical default. sigma_hat default (stable variance). Balances service (covers L+1=5 periods demand ~340) vs holding (q=0.5 moderate stock).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), late March, no major calendar events imminent (Easter ~4/21). Product: women's leather hip belt, steady accessory demand. Game demands P1-6: 40,87,57,61,98,50 (mean=65.5, std~22.4), consistent with hist overall mean~64.6 post early outlier. No new changepoint; prior hist shift to lower mean/variance holds. LT=4 confirmed (P1 order arr P5:4 periods; P2 arr P6:4 periods), no losses/overdues (P3:92 expected P7 arrival). Pipeline=257 + on-hand=27=284 covers ~4+ periods at ~65/demand. Parameters: L default (promised=4 matches obs); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=6 to use latest 6 game samples for (1+4)*recent mean~327, sqrt(5)*recent std~50; balances service at q=0.5 (z=0) vs holding with current high pipeline, targets modest order to replenish without excess.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1), early spring, no major holidays (Easter ~4/21); steady demand expected for women's leather belt accessory. Game demands (P1-7): 40,87,57,61,98,50,57; avg~64.3, recent 4 avg=66.5, consistent with carry-over post-2019-01-07 lower regime (~54.5 avg last 4 hist, overall hist mean 64.6). No sustained new changepoint (P5=98 isolated spike, not 3+ periods). Lead times confirmed 4 periods consistently (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7); next expected P4:38 arrives during P8 (visible P9). No losses/overdues. On-hand=62, in-transit=209 (P4=38+P5=19+P6=108+P7=44), total pipeline~271 covers >4 periods demand. L default (promised=observed=4). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 (last 7 game demands capture current regime/volatility, backend scales to (1+4)=5 periods; avoids old 105 outlier, balances q=0.5 service vs holding).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early April, no major retail events (Easter ~4/21 unlikely to spike belts significantly). Recent demands P6-P8: 50,57,47 (avg 51.3, std ~4.5 low); vs P1-P5 avg 68.6 higher/variable (-25% shift). Historical shift to ~54.5 confirmed ongoing. LT exactly 4 for all observed (P1-4 orders arrived P5-8). No losses/overdues. On-hand 53, in-transit 222 (P5:19/P9, P6:108/P10, P7:44/P11, P8:51/P12). Pipeline ~275 for (1+4)=5 periods (~55/wk matches recent). Default L=4. mu_hat recent_3 captures low regime (5*51.3~257). sigma_hat recent_3 low vol. Balances service (covers recent low demand) vs holding (tight base stock for q=0.5, avoids excess amid stable low demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg decreased to 51.3 over P6-P8 (-25% from P1-P5 avg 68.6), lower variance std~4.5 confirmed.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15): Spring, pre-Easter (4/21) but minimal impact expected for women's leather belts. Demand regime stable low since changepoint P6 (avg 50 over P6-P9:50,57,47,46; std~4.3), confirmed by carry-over. All observed LT=4 (P1-P5 orders arrived exactly on P5-P9). No overdue shipments; in-transit=203 (P6:108+P7:44+P8:51+P9:0 expected P10-P13). On-hand=26 low vs ~50 demand, but pipeline covers. Use recent_4 for mu/sigma to reflect low-demand regime (mu_hat~(1+4)*50=250, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*4.3~9.6); L default=4. Ensures base_stock~250 (z=0,q=0.5), order=min(250-pipeline,cap) to avoid excess holding while covering service.

On-hand=91 (covers ~2 periods), in-transit=116 (P7:44 due P11, P8:51/P12, P9:0/P13, P10:21/P14; covers ~2.5 more periods). Total pipeline+on-hand ~207 vs. 5-period need ~243; low order expected. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect sustained low demand regime (length=5>=3), L default (confirmed=4). This raises service level for low mean/volatility while minimizing overstock/holding (q=0.5).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): Early May, no major holidays (Mother's Day ~May 12 unlikely to spike belt demand significantly). Demand stable in low regime since P6 changepoint (carry-over): P6-P12 demands [50,57,47,46,43,50,58], avg=50.14, std~4.8 (low variance confirmed). All 8 observed lead times exactly 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, ..., P8->P12); no delays/losses. In-transit 109 = P9:0 (arr P13), P10:21 (P14), P11:36 (P15), P12:52 (P16). On-hand 78 covers ~1.5 periods. Pipeline covers next 3 periods (~109 for 3*50=150, slight short). Use L default (promised=4 matches all data). mu_hat recent_N=7 for regime (1+4)*50.14~251 targets base stock for recent mean. sigma_hat recent_N=7 captures low volatility. Balances q=0.5 service vs holding with stable forecast; OR cap prevents overorder.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13), post-Mother's Day (May 12), women's belt accessory may have lingering demand effects; P13 demand=77 (pre-May12) shows recent uptick (P12=58, P13=77 vs prior ~50). Confirmed demand regime low since P6 (carry-over: avg 51.3 P6-P8, extended P6-P13 avg=53.5 std~10.3). All 8 concluded arrivals LT=4 exactly (P5-P12), no losses; P13 arrived=0 as expected (P9 order=0). Pipeline=169 (P10:21 arr P14, P11:36 P15, P12:52 P16, P13:60 P17). On-hand=1 low. L=default (promised=4 confirmed). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=8 (regime length=8 since P6 changepoint, N=max(min(8,20),3)=8) reflects sustained low mean/var vs initial historical high. mu_hat~(5*53.5)=267; sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*10.3~23; q=1/(1+1)=0.5 so z~0, base_stock~267, order~267-(1+169)=97 balancing stockouts vs holding.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20), late spring; possible pre-Memorial Day (May 27) demand uptick for women's leather belt accessories. Recent demands show upward changepoint at P13: P13=77, P14=139 (avg 108, +87% vs P1-P12 avg 57.8), variance increasing. On-hand=0, in-transit=220 (expected: P15=36/P11, P16=52/P12, P17=60/P13, P18=72/P14; all prior arrivals confirmed L=4, no losses). Use recent_N=5 (P10-P14 demands 43/50/58/77/139, regime shift evidence, N=max(min(2+,20),3) adjusted to available recent for stability) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to elevate forecast (mu_hat~(1+4)*73.4=367, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*47.5~106); L default (consistent 4). Ensures base_stock~367 > pipeline 220, ordering ~147 to cover high recent demand over 5 periods, balancing stockouts vs holding.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, Memorial Day - start of summer sales season for fashion accessories like belts). Recent demand spike P13-15: 77,139,138 (avg 118, +130% from prior avg ~55 P6-12), confirmed sustained over 3 periods with seasonal evidence (late May Memorial Day kickoff). No lead time deviations: all 10 observed arrivals exactly 4 periods. On-hand=0 (stockouts P14-15), in-transit=322 (P12-15 orders:52+60+72+138) covers ~2-3 periods at new demand level but short for (1+4)=5 periods (~590). Use default L=4 (matches all history). mu_hat recent_3 for new regime (backend:5*118=590). sigma_hat recent_3 (backend:sqrt(5)*~47.7~106) to capture volatility uptick. Balances high service for profit vs holding by targeting base stock ~590 - 322 pipeline, preventing further lost sales amid spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 (2019/5/6): avg increased to 118 over P13-P15 (+130% from P6-P12 avg 55), higher variance std~47.7 confirmed with Memorial Day/summer seasonal driver.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3): Early June, post-Memorial Day (P16=5/27), summer seasonal for women's belts/accessories continues high demand regime (carry-over P13 shift confirmed). Recent demands P13-P16: 77,139,138,138 (avg 123, std~30.7, +125% from prior low ~55). On-hand=0, in-transit=447 exactly matches P13(60)+P14(72)+P15(138)+P16(177), all prior arrivals on exact LT=4 (no losses/overdues). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high regime (regime_length=4>=3); default L=4 reliable. Parameters target base_stock ~123*5 +0*30.7*sqrt(5) ~615 to cover 5 periods high demand, minus pipeline, balancing q=0.5 service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained through P16: avg 123 over P13-P16 (+125% from P6-P12 avg 55), std~30.7 confirmed.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10): Early summer season for women's leather belts/accessories, high demand regime sustained (Memorial Day/summer driver). Demands P13-P17: 77,139,138,138,121 (avg 122.6, +123% from P6-P12 avg~50-55, std~27). Pipeline 555 units from P14(72)-P17(168) orders, all prior arrivals confirmed LT=4 (no losses/overdues). On-hand=0, P14 order arrives during P18 post-decision. Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/variance regime (regime_length=5>=3, N=5); L=default (consistent LT=4). This boosts base_stock for (1+4)=5 periods high demand (~613 mu, ~133 sigma), balancing profit=holding=1 via q=0.5 service, while cap limits overorder; addresses no LT drift.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained through P17 (2019/6/3): avg 122.6 over P13-P17 (+123% from P6-P12 avg 50.1), higher variance std~27 confirmed.

On-hand=0, in-transit=541 matches expected arrivals: P15 order 138 (due P19), P16:177(P20), P17:168(P21), P18:58(P22); all prior 13 arrivals exactly 4 periods, no losses/drift. Use L default (promised 4, matches all observed). mu_hat recent_6 scales recent high mean x(1+4)=5 for review+lead coverage. sigma_hat recent_6 captures elevated volatility. Balances q=0.5 service vs holding by targeting base_stock ~ recent high mean + z*sigma (z~0), with cap limiting overorder; compensates OR backend's use of promised L/historical stats by feeding current regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24), late June summer period; women's leather belt demand in sustained high regime since changepoint at P13 (2019/5/6, Memorial Day/summer driver), confirmed over P13-P19 (7 periods): demands [77,139,138,138,121,126,122], avg=123 (+123% from prior P6-P12 avg~51), std~27. All observed lead times exactly 4 periods (13 arrivals from P1-P15 orders, no losses/drift). On-hand=16 (low, expect stockout risk this period), in-transit=478 (P16:177 arrives P20 during this period after decision, P17:168/P21, P18:58/P22, P19:75/P23). Use default L=4 (promised/observed match). mu_hat recent_7 scales (1+4)*123=615 for review+lead coverage of high regime. sigma_hat recent_7 uses elevated volatility for safety stock amid summer demand. Balances high service for profit vs holding by anchoring to sustained regime data, preventing understocking with strong pipeline.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained through P19 (2019/6/17): avg 123 over P13-P19 (+123% from P6-P12 avg 51), std~27 confirmed.

Period 21 (2019/7/1): Early July, summer season ongoing near Independence Day (July 4), women's leather belt/accessories likely sustained high demand post-Memorial Day driver. High demand regime confirmed P13-P20: demands [77,139,138,138,121,126,122,98], avg=119.9 (+135% vs P6-P12 avg=51), std\u224830.2 (calculated sqrt(var=911.1)). All 20+ concluded arrivals show exact lead_time=4 (no drifts/losses); in-transit=422 (P17:168+P18:58+P19:75+P20:121, all on schedule), on-hand=95 ample coverage. No overdue shipments. Set L=default (promised=4 confirmed), mu_hat=recent_8 (5*119.9\u2248600 targets high mean over review+lead), sigma_hat=recent_8 (sqrt(5)*30.2\u224867 buffers volatility). With profit=holding=1 (q=0.5,z=0), this drives base_stock\u2248600 (high service), capped policy prevents excess amid pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8), summer season for women's leather belt accessory; high demand regime from P13 (Memorial Day/summer onset) sustained through P21 with avg 117 over P13-P21 (+102% from P1-P12 avg 58), despite slight recent dip P20=98/P21=94 (still above prior regime); std ~27 confirmed higher variance. All observed lead times exactly 4 periods (latest: P21 arrival from P17 order), no losses/overdues, in-transit 337 covers upcoming (e.g., P18 order=58 arriving P22). On-hand 169 sufficient short-term. Use recent_N N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on sustained summer high-demand regime (regime_length=9, max(min(9,20),3)=9), L default as actual=promised=4 matches all history. This boosts base_stock to cover ~5 periods (1+4) high demand ~585 mean, balancing profit=holding=1 via q=0.5 service level while minimizing excess hold via recent volatility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15 mid-July, summer season for women's leather belt accessory). Demand softened post-early summer peak: P20-22 demands 98/94/75 avg=89 (-27% from P13-P19 avg=123), lower variance std~10.1 vs prior ~27. Changelength=3 periods confirmed sustained decrease. All lead times exactly 4 periods (latest P22: ordered P18 arrived P22). No lost shipments; in-transit=358 (P19-22 orders:75+121+83+79) + on-hand=152 covers >5 periods at 89 demand. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture new lower regime (backend: mu_hat=5*89=445, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*10.1~22.5), L=default=4. This lowers base_stock~445 to reduce holding costs amid softening demand while maintaining service vs prior over-forecasting risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward at Period 20: avg 89 over P20-P22 (-27% from P13-P19 avg 123), lower variance std~10.1 confirmed (vs prior ~27).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22), late July post-summer peak for women's leather belt (accessories). Demand regime downward shift at P20 sustained through P23: demands P20=98, P21=94, P22=75, P23=72 (avg 84.75, std~11.4, -30% from P13-P19 peak avg~123, lower var vs prior ~27). All observed lead times exactly 4 periods (latest P23: P19 order arrived P23), no losses/overdues; in-transit=283 matches P20=121+P21=83+P22=79+P23=0 (expected P24-P27). On-hand=155 covers ~2 periods. Use L default=4 (confirmed). mu_hat recent_4 (regime length=4>=3), sigma_hat recent_4 to lower base_stock matching reduced mean/volatility, balancing service vs holding (profit=holding=$1, q=0.5) while pipeline covers 5 periods ahead.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime sustained through P23: avg 84.8 over P20-P23 (-30% from P13-P19 peak 123), std~11 confirmed (vs prior ~27).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29, late July post-summer peak). Downward demand regime from P20-P24 sustained: demands [98,94,75,72,52], avg=78.2 (-36% from P13-P19 peak avg~123), low std~9.6 (vs prior ~27). High on-hand=224 covers multiple low-demand periods; in-transit=162 (P21:83 arr P25, P22:79 arr P26, P23/P24:0). All observed lead times=4 periods consistently (latest P20 order arr P24), no losses. Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect current low-demand/low-var regime over regime_length=5; default L=4 ensures OR backend targets base stock for ~5-period (1+L) coverage at q=0.5 service (profit=holding=1), minimizing overstock risk amid high inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5): Early August, post-Memorial/summer peak for women's leather belts; downward demand regime from P20 sustained through P25 (avg 76.2 over P20-P25, -38% from P13-P19 peak 123), std~17 (up slightly from ~11 in P20-P23).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12): Late summer, post-summer peak (Memorial Day driven high in May-Jun P13-19 avg123). Downward regime since P20 confirmed sustained: P20-P26 demands [98,94,75,72,52,66,69] avg=75.1 (-39% from P13-19 peak 123), std\u224816.1 (vs prior high regime ~27). On-hand=251 covers ~3.5 periods at 70/demand; pipeline=61 matches expected (P23:0/P27, P24:0/P28, P25:5/P29, P26:56/P30), no losses/overdues\u2014all observed LT=4. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect sustained lower mean/variance regime (N=7=max(min(regime_length=7,20),3)); L=default (confirmed 4). Parameters target base_stock ~ mu_hat=5*75.1=375.5 + safety, covering 5-period demand ~375 vs current 312 inventory position; balances service (q=0.5) vs holding with recent stats, ignoring early high-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime sustained through P26 (2019/8/5): avg 75.1 over P20-P26 (-39% from P13-P19 peak 123), lower variance std~16.1 confirmed (vs prior ~27).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019/8/19): Late summer (back-to-school proximity for accessories/belts), but demand remains in downward regime since P20 changepoint (post-peak summer/Memorial Day). Recent P20-P27 demands [98,94,75,72,52,66,69,63], avg=73.6 (-40% from P13-P19 peak avg~123), std~14.5 (lower vs prior ~27). On-hand=188 covers ~2.5 periods at recent avg; in-transit=125 (P24:0/P28, P25:5/P29, P26:56/P30, P27:64/P31) aligns perfectly, no losses/overdues\u2014all prior arrivals confirmed L=4. Use recent_8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect sustained lower mean/variance regime (regime_length=8, N=8); default L=4 (consistent observed). With profit=holding=1, lowers base_stock to cut holding costs on ample inventory while protecting service.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime sustained through P27 (2019/8/12): avg 73.6 over P20-P27 (-40% from P13-P19 peak 123), lower variance std~14.5 confirmed (vs prior ~27).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26): Late August, back-to-school season may mildly lift accessory demand like belts, but recent data shows sustained downward regime from P20-P28 (9 periods: demands 98,94,75,72,52,66,69,63,84; avg~74.8, std~15.2), -39% from P13-P19 peak ~123. Inventory: on-hand=104 covers current demand; in-transit=181 exactly matches undelivered orders from P25(5)+P26(56)+P27(64)+P28(56), all on promised LT=4 track with no losses/overdues observed (consistent arrivals at exactly 4 periods). Use L=default (stable LT=4). mu_hat=recent_9 (regime_length=9>=3, captures current low-demand mean for (1+4)*74.8~374 over review+lead). sigma_hat=recent_9 (low vol std~15 for balanced base-stock). This boosts service under low demand while minimizing hold costs vs. all-data default; q=1/(1+1)=0.5 implies conservative z~0.

No evidence of new shift (P28-29 at 84/83 slight uptick but <3 periods). On-hand 26 low vs recent ~80 demand (risk stockout today), but in-transit 265 ample (~3.5 periods coverage). Expected P30 arrival: P26 order=56 (on schedule). All historical arrivals confirmed lead_time=4 (no losses/overdues). Use recent_N=10 (regime_length=10 since P20 changepoint) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect lower mean/variance vs summer peak; L default (promised=4 matches all observed). Parameters lower base_stock to curb overstock/holding costs while pipeline covers demand.

On-hand=0, P30 ended 0 after demand=111>sold=82. In-transit=296 exactly matches expected arrivals (P27:64 in P31, P28:56 in P32, P29:89 in P33, P30:87 in P34; all prior lt=4 confirmed, no losses). L default as all observed lt=4 consistent. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_3 (changelpoint P28, regime_length=3 so N=3) to boost forecast capturing uptick (backend: mu_hat~5*92.7=463.5), balancing higher service vs holding (q=0.5); covers ~4-5 periods demand while pipeline provides buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 28: avg 92.7 over P28-P30 (+26% from P20-P27 avg 73.6), higher variance std~15.9 confirmed.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16): Late September, back-to-school season may sustain recent upward demand for women's belts/accessories. Recent demands P28-P31: 84,83,111,100 (avg 94.5, +28% from P20-P27 avg 73.6, std~13.5 sample), confirming sustained upward regime shift since P28 (4 periods, >3 sustained). No lead time deviations; all observed LT=4 periods exactly, no losses (P27/P28 arrived=0 matched zero orders from P23/P24). On-hand=0, in-transit=351 covers near-term (e.g., recent orders P28:56/P29:89/P30:87/P31:119 arriving P32-P35). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current regime mean/variance (mu_hat~(1+4)*94.5=472.5, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*13.5~30), balancing higher service for stockouts vs holding (profit=holding=1, q=0.5). L=default (promised 4 matches observed).

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime sustained through P31 (2019/9/9): avg 94.5 over P28-P31 (+28% from P20-P27 avg 73.6), lower variance std~13.5 confirmed (vs prior downward ~14.5).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23), late September fall fashion season for women's leather belt accessories; no immediate holidays but steady demand post-summer. Demand in upward regime since P28 (2019/8/19), sustained through P32: demands P28-P32 [84,83,111,100,89], avg=93.4 (+27% from P20-P27 avg 73.6), std~11.9 (slightly lower than prior ~13.5). On-hand=0 after P32 stockout (demand=89>sold=56), in-transit=412 exactly matches expected pipeline from P29-P32 orders [89+87+119+117], all prior arrivals confirmed lead_time=4 (e.g., P32 arr from P28).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30), late September approaching fall/Halloween season for women's leather belt (accessories/fashion item), potential demand uptick from fashion shifts. Recent demands: P28-P32 sustained upward regime avg 93.4 (+27% from prior), P33=189 spike (+112% over P32), stockout (sold=89<189). On-hand=0, in-transit=378 (P30=87\u2192P34, P31=119\u2192P35, P32=117\u2192P36, P33=55\u2192P37; all LT=4 confirmed, no losses/overdues). All historical LT=4 consistent. Use recent_N=6 (P28-P33 demands:84,83,111,100,89,189; regime_length=6 from P28 changepoint, avg~109, std~40.5) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained upward + recent volatility/spike, yielding mu_hat~(1+4)*109=545, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*40.5~90; L default=4. Raises base_stock/ordering to improve service level on higher recent demand while q=0.5 limits excess holding.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7): Early October, fall season for women's leather belt/accessories; steady demand expected post-summer, pre-holidays (Halloween late Oct). Upward demand regime from P28 (per carry-over) sustained: P28-P34 demands [84,83,111,100,89,189,95], avg 107.3 (+15% from carry-over P28-P32 avg 93.4), includes P33 spike (189, possible event) but P34 normalized at 95; regime length 7 periods, no new changepoint. On-hand=0, in-transit=460 (high pipeline: e.g., P31 order=119 arriving P35, P32=117 P36, P33=55 P37, P34=169 P38, plus earlier; covers >>5 periods at ~100 avg). All observed LT=4 consistently (e.g., P34 arrive from P30, P33 from P29, etc.; no losses/delays). Set L=default (promised 4). mu_hat=recent_N N=7 (backend:5*107.3\u2248536). sigma_hat=recent_N N=7 (captures recent vol incl. spike). With q=0.5 (profit=holding=1), targets base stock ~mu_hat (z=0) + safety; high pipeline prevents overordering, matches recent mean/vol for service vs holding balance.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14), fall season post-Labor Day and back-to-school (P33 9/23 spike to 189 likely event-driven, not sustained as P34-35 avg 92.5). Upward demand regime from P28 sustained through P35: avg 105.1 over P28-P35 (8 periods, +43% from prior P20-P27 avg 73.6), higher std ~31 due to P33 outlier (vs prior ~12). Lead times consistently 4 periods across all observed arrivals (latest P35: P31 order, no losses or delays; in-transit 418 + on-hand 29 covers >4 periods at ~90-100 demand). Use default L (promised 4 reliable). recent_N N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current upward regime (mu_hat~(1+4)*105.1=525.5, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*31~69), balancing service vs holding (q=0.5 conservative base-stock avoids excess amid high pipeline).

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime sustained through P35 (2019/10/7): avg 105.1 over P28-P35 (+43% from P20-P27 avg 73.6), higher std~31 confirmed (driven by P33 spike=189).

On-hand=49, in-transit=380 exactly matches expected arrivals from P33(55)+P34(169)+P35(77)+P36(79), all lead times consistently 4 periods (no losses/overdues). Demand upward regime sustained P28-P36 (9 periods): avg=104.2 (+42% vs P20-P27 avg73.6), higher std~30 (driven by P33=189).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demands P34-P37: 95,90,97,98 (avg~95, low variance); P33 spike=189 outlier but regime high. On-hand=6 low, but in-transit=418 ample (e.g., P34 order=169 arrives P38). All observed lead times=4 periods consistently (latest P37 arrived from P33). No overdue/lost shipments. Use default L=4. recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current high-demand regime (N=10 as regime_length~10>3, <20), informing backend base_stock for (1+4)=5 periods demand ~518 mean, balancing profit=holding=1 (q=0.5 service).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4): Early November, pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday holiday season for women's leather belt accessory; anticipate potential demand uptick based on calendar (spikes possible in P42-P43). On-hand 127 + in-transit 343 covers recent demand (~90-100/period). All observed lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple arrivals e.g., P38:169 from P34; no losses). Demand upward regime sustained since P28 (2019/8/19, avg~105 P28-P35 per carry-over), extended to P28-P38 (11 periods, avg~98.5, evidence: consistent 80-100+ except P33=189 spike and P38=48 dip). No new sustained shift (P38 low is single period, not 3+). Use L default (promised=4, matches all history). mu_hat recent_11 (regime length=11, N=11) for (1+4)*~98.5\u2248492 demand over review+lead. sigma_hat recent_11 captures higher volatility (std~35 from 189/48).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11, Veterans Day), approaching Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29); women's leather belt may see modest holiday demand lift, but recent P38=48, P39=41 (avg 44.5, -46% vs P36-P37 avg 97.5) not sustained (only 2 periods, <3+ threshold). Upward regime from changepoint P28 (per carry-over) extended through P39: 12 periods P28-P39 demands avg 93.75 (+28% vs P20-P27 avg 73.6), higher variance due to P33=189 spike and recent lows. No new changepoint confirmed. All observed lead times=4 (e.g., P39 arrival from P35 order), no losses/overdues; in-transit=289 matches P36-P39 orders (79+93+94+23). Pipeline+OH=452 high vs expected (1+4)*93.75~469 base_stock. Use recent_12 (regime_length=12, N=min(12,20)=12) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target current regime mean/variance, yielding conservative base_stock minimizing holding costs while covering ~5-period demand; L=default (promised 4 matches all history).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18), pre-Thanksgiving (Nov 28 during P42), women's basic leather belt (accessories). Recent demand changepoint at P38 (10/28): sharp drop to avg 39 over P38-P40 (48,41,29; -60% from P34-P37 avg 95), low variance std~9.6 confirmed (regime length=3). High pipeline (OH 213 + IT 227=440) exceeds 5-period forecast ~195, so low mu_hat/sigma_hat ensures base_stock ~197 < pipeline (order~0) to minimize holding costs amid lull (holiday spike uncertain for belts; recent data dominates). L=4 confirmed consistent across all observed arrivals (e.g., P40 from P36, P39 from P35). No overdue/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward at Period 38 (2019/10/28): avg 39 over P38-P40 (-60% from P34-P37 avg 95), lower variance std~9.6 confirmed.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Approaching Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29), potential demand spike for women's leather belt accessories due to holiday shopping, but no evidence yet as recent demands P38-P41 (48,41,29,33) confirm sustained downward regime avg 37.75 (-60% from P34-P37 avg 95), low std~8.5. High pipeline (on-hand 273 + in-transit 134 = 407) covers 10+ periods even at prior highs. All observed lead times consistently 4 periods (e.g., P37 order arrived P41), no losses. Use default L=4; recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low mu_hat~5*37.75=189, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*8.5~19; base_stock~189 (z=0 since q=0.5), order=0 as pipeline>>189, minimizes holding costs while covered for spikes.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime sustained through P41 (2019/11/18): avg 37.8 over P38-P41 (-60% from P34-P37 avg 95), lower variance std~8.5 confirmed (vs prior ~31).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2 Cyber Monday, post-Black Friday). Accessory belt likely sees holiday gift demand spike continuation from P42 demand=227 (+494% vs P38-P41 avg 37.8 low regime). Calendar: Thanksgiving/Black Friday (P42 Nov25=227), Cyber Monday today, ramp to Christmas (P46 ~Dec23). Low demand P38-P41 anomaly ended, no longer holds. On-hand 140 + in-transit 40 (P39 ord23 arr today + P40 ord17 arr P44 + P41/42 ord0) =180 pipeline covers ~1 week low demand but risks stockouts in high holiday regime. LT consistently 4 periods (all 38+ concludes confirm), no losses/overdues. Changepoint: upward shift P42 holiday high mean~227, high vol. Forecast next 5-wk total demand ~850 (weekly ~170: 220 CM, 160, 170, 220 pre-Xmas, 80 post), weekly std~65 (evidenced by recent spikes 227/189 + highs~120 std~30-50). Explicit seasonality-based params set high mu_hat=850 (base_stock~850 > pipeline180, orders ~670 capped~ mu/5=170 +0.73*sigma~170+110=280) to aggressively build inventory for peak service despite h=p=1, prioritizing profit from sales over holding; high sigma_hat=145 boosts cap for more ordering now.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), pre-Christmas holiday season (Christmas 12/25 on P46). Recent demands: P41:33, P42:227 (Black Friday 11/25 spike), P43:87 indicate emerging high demand regime shift from prior downward low (P38-P41 avg 37.8, std~8.5). Changepoint at P42: +315% avg increase to 157 (P42-P43), high variance ~100 driven by holiday calendar events (Black Friday confirmed spike, Christmas ramp-up expected on P44-P46). Pipeline: in-transit 294 (17 arriving P44 from P40, 0 P45/P46, 277 P47 from P43); on-hand 76 low vs expected 5-period demand ~580. All observed lead times=4 (e.g., P43 arrived P39 order). L default. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_3 (N=3 for emerging regime length~2+, min 3; demands P41-P43 avg~116, std~100) to weight recent holiday upshift (backend: mu_hat=116*5=580, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*100~224), enabling OR base_stock~mu_hat (q=0.5,z=0) + safety to cover spikes, prevent stockouts (high profit loss) while cap limits overorder vs holding.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), approaching Christmas (Dec 25), holiday demand surge confirmed with P42 (11/25 Black Friday)=227, P43=87, P44=108 (avg 140.7, +273% from P38-P41 avg 37.75), sample std=75.5 (high variance). On-hand=0, in-transit=486 (P43 ord=277 + P44=209), P45 arrival=P41 ord=0 so start=0, risk stockout. All historical arrivals exactly LT=4 periods (e.g., P40->P44, P39->P43), no losses/overdues. Use L default (promised 4). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=3 to capture holiday regime over (1+4)=5 periods (mu_hat~703, sigma_hat~sqrt(5)*75.5~169), raising base_stock=mu_hat (since q=0.5, z=0) above pipeline=486 to cover peak demand, minimize lost sales during Christmas while capping overstock via backend policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 42 (2019/11/25): avg 140.7 over P42-P44 (+273% from P38-P41 avg 37.75), higher variance std=75.5 confirmed with Black Friday/Christmas holiday driver.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23): Christmas week holiday peak for accessories belt (giftable). High demand regime from P42 sustained: demands P42=227, P43=87, P44=108, P45=104 (avg 131.5, std~62; +247% vs P38-P41 avg~38), driven by Black Friday/Christmas. On-hand=0, in-transit=704 (P43 ord277 arr P47, P44 ord209 arr P48, P45 ord218 arr P49); P46 arrival=0 (P42 ord=0), expect stockout ~130 demand. Lead time consistently 4 periods (all 40+ arrivals confirmed W=4, no losses/overdues). Use default L=4; recent_N N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set mu_hat=5*131.5~657, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*62~138, raising base stock ~657 to cover (1+4)*holiday demand, minimizing lost sales (profit=1) vs holding (1), given pipeline timing.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas/New Year's Eve, expect demand drop after holiday peak (carry-over P45: +273% shift at P42 Black Friday/Christmas driver, avg 140.7 P42-P44). Recent demands P43-P46: 87,108,104,72 (avg 92.75, -18% from holiday avg ~140, std~16.5 lower variance vs holiday ~75). On-hand=0, stockouts P45-P46; in-transit=704 (P43:277 + P44:209 + P45:218 + P46:0, all on track for L=4 arrivals). No overdue/missing shipments; all historical LT=4 confirmed. Changepoint post-holiday peak ~P42, current taper regime length=4 (P43-P46). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect normalized post-holiday demand/volatility, L default (stable). This lowers base_stock vs full history/holiday, reduces overstock risk with high pipeline (704>> recent demand), balances service/holding given q=0.5.
