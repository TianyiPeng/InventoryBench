Demand analysis: Historical samples (5 weeks ending 2019-02-04) average ~342 (292,300,355,391,372), with increasing trend to 372. Actual demands: P1 (2019-02-11):325 (slight dip post-historical), P2 (2019-02-18):421 (spike, +30% over prior). Recent avg (P1+P2)=373 (+9% over historical mean), higher volatility. Product is sports tights (H&M ladies sport leggings); late Feb 2019 post-Valentine's/Chinese New Year, no immediate major calendar events, but possible fitness/early spring demand uptick. Inventory: On-hand=0 entering P3 (stockouts in P1/P2), in-transit=820 covers ~2 periods at recent avg but arrives later; high stockout risk for P3-P4.
