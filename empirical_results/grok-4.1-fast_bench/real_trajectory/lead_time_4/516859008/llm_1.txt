Fashion belts likely spike for holiday outfits/gifts; anticipate demand ramp-up similar to prior back-to-school/holiday surges (+44% peaks seen). (b) Demand regime: Pre-holiday high sustained P38-42 avg 104 (P42=115 peak); P43=50 sharp drop (-56%) possibly post-Thanksgiving/Black Friday lull (Nov 28/Cyber Monday Dec 2), but single-period anomaly vs sustained prior regimes\u2014no confirmed downshift (needs 3+ periods). Holiday calendar overrides, forecast P44-P45 ~110 (+10% vs recent avg), P46-P47 ~140-160 peak. Historical Jan low irrelevant. (c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods (all 40+ arrivals confirm, e.g., P43 arrival from P39); no losses/drift. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 204 (high). In-transit 570: P40 ord140\u2192P44 arr, P41:140\u2192P45, P42:140\u2192P46, P43:150\u2192P47.

(e) Order 120 for P48: Matches forecasted holiday demand (~120 avg), replenishes pipeline at recent order levels without excess (high inv 250+ projected costs holding $250/period = lost profit); balances stockout risk (past losses e.g. P33) vs holding cost.",
