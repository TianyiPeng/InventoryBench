Date 2019/12/16 (Mon) is pre-Christmas (Dec 25, ~9 days away), in holiday shopping ramp-up; potential demand lift for basics/gifts but recent data shows lows (P43-44:47,57) post-Thanksgiving spike (P42=204 near 11/28 holiday), suggesting volatility not sustained peak. Historical Jan 2019 highs (72-99) indicate possible post-holiday surge but irrelevant now. (b) Demand regime: Carry-over notes late Nov downtrend P39-P41 avg76 (-57% from fall highs); extended with P43-P44 lows avg52 but interrupted by P42 holiday spike 204; recent 3 periods avg103 highly volatile, no new sustained regime (lacks 3+ consistent periods post-spike). Low winter baseline ~60 with holiday fluctuations. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (latest P44 arrival from P40 confirms; all recent P39-44 arrivals on schedule); no missing/overdue orders (in-transit 600 matches expected: P41=200\u2192P45, P42=200\u2192P46, P43=200\u2192P47). (d) Inventory strong: OH=627 (P44 end), +200 arrive P45 \u2192 start ~827; pipeline covers 600 over next 3 periods at ~100/wk forecast; total covers >> remaining 3 periods (45-47) even at 200/wk spikes; high OH risks $1/period holding across 627+ units. (e) Order 0: Ample coverage (827+ start P45, pipeline for P46-47) vs low-recent demand (~60 avg) and endgame (P45 order arrives P49 post-total 47); minimizes holding costs while avoiding stockout risk; no need to replenish pipeline.",
