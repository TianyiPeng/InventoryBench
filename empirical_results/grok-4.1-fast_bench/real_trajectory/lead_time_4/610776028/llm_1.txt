Non-seasonal staple, but Feb 2019 timing post-winter holidays, pre-Valentine's (Feb 14) which may slightly boost apparel; history shows ramp-up possibly signaling spring transition or product momentum. (b) Demand regime: Historical weekly data (Jan7:0, Jan14:0, Jan21:8, Jan28:17, Feb4:27) indicates accelerating growth (recent 3-period avg=17.3, up ~+9/wk linear trend); forecast Period 1 (Feb11) ~35, rising to ~50 by Period 5; no sustained regime shift confirmed yet (only 5 points). (c) Lead time: No conclude messages; promised 4 periods, no inference possible; no missing orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1 demand will stock out fully (post-decision); pipeline empty, must initiate coverage for Periods 1-5 via new order arriving Period 5. (e) Order logic: Target coverage for 5 periods (L+1) at escalating forecast (35+42+49+56+63=~245 total), but conservative start discounting trend uncertainty and equal P/H costs favoring slight understock vs. long hold; order 150 to build base while monitoring.",
