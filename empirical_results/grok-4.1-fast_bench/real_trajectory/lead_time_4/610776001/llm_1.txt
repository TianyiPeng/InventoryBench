Year-round staple, mild seasonal relevance: February (winter) but lightweight suitable for layering/indoor; minor Valentine's Day (Feb 14) proximity unlikely to spike demand significantly. Historical data anchors: prior weeks (Jan7-Feb4) show demand 105-212, recent increase evident. (b) Historical demand regime: 5 weeks avg 157 (145,144,105,181,212); dip mid-Jan (105), then uptick last 2 weeks avg 197 (+18% vs prior 3-week avg 131).
