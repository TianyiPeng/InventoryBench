Post-Chinese New Year (Feb 5) \u2013 possible replenishment dip or normalization. Winter-to-spring transition; not heavy seasonal peak but steady fashion demand. Historical seed (Jan 7-Feb 4): 84,68,51,53,68 (mean=64.8, recent=68, range 51-84). (b) Demand regime: No in-game history (Period 1); seed data shows stable mean ~65 with minor fluctuations (std~12.8), no clear regime shift; forecast ~65-75/period, slight Valentine's bump possible.
