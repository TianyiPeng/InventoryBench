Current status: Period 42 (2019/11/25), on-hand=167, in-transit=0, so inventory position=167. No pipeline risks. Demand analysis: Sustained decline per carry-over (single digits/low teens through late Oct/early Nov), but recent P39-41 (11/4-11/18): demands 15,18,12 (avg=15, up +67% from P36-38 avg9.3). Full recent P37-41 avg=12.6. Product is women's V-neck satin blouse (everyday, but lace trim suitable for holiday parties). Date=11/25 (pre-Thanksgiving Mon Nov25, Thu28; Black Friday Fri29) suggests potential mild uptick for holiday shopping, but no spike yet (P41=12). Expected demand next 5 periods (L+1): conservatively 15-20/period =75-100 total. On-hand 167 covers 8-13 periods (> remaining 6 periods to 47), ample buffer vs safety needs. OR recommendation=147 ignores recent regime shift to low demand (uses full history w/ early highs ~100s), overestimating base stock (implies ~314 total IP target). Strategy: Override to 0 - prioritize drawing down excess inventory to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period); 167 provides full coverage even if holiday demand doubles to ~30/period (still ~5+ periods coverage).
