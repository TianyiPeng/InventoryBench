(b) Demand regime: long-term avg ~290 (P5-P42), recent early Dec P43-45: 143/209/231 avg 194 (-33%), sustained 3 periods post-Thanksgiving dip; holiday proximity may reverse to prior highs (e.g., P33:405, P12:438). Forecast P46-P47 ~300-350, then ~280. (c) Lead time confirmed consistently 4 periods (all arrivals, incl. latest P45 from P41); no discrepancies or lost orders; in-transit exactly matches outstanding: P42(300)+P43(350)=650. (d) On-hand 1186 (high, ~4x weekly demand); pipeline covers P46(300), P47(350), P48(0), P49(0); projected (D=280): P46 end~1206, P47~1276, P48~996, P49~716, P50~436 (safe but depleting; higher D=300 accelerates to ~400 P50 end). Total coverage OH+pipeline=1836 (~6.5 weeks). (e) High profit($19) vs low holding($1) favors stocking for holiday risk/Jan (hist ~260-300); order 300 = long-term avg to replenish P50 arrival, maintain buffer ~500-800 end-P50, balance service vs gradual drawdown.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Early December demand shift lower: avg 194 (P43:143, P44:209, P45:231) vs long-term avg 290 (-33%) over 3 periods.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) Product: Fine-knit trainer socks (women's socks/tights), basic winter apparel. Date 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas, New Year's Eve week). World knowledge: Post-holiday demand typically low for apparel as gift season ends; cold weather supports steady but not spiking sock demand; historical Jan 2019 avgs ~266, but recent Dec shift lower overrides. (b) Demand regime: Confirmed low Dec regime sustained P43-46: 143/209/231/224 (avg 202, -30% vs long-term ~290); forecast P47 ~220 (conservative, no uptick evidence yet). Early-year historical ~260 aligns loosely but recent dominates. (c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods across all observed arrivals (e.g., P46: P42 order; no deviations/losses); expected: P47=350(P43), P48=0(P44), P49=0(P45), P50=300(P46). In-transit 650 matches. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 1262 + transit 650 = IP 1912 (~8-9 periods at 220/wk); post-P47 (~1262+350-220=1392 ending) remains excess vs low demand. (e) Order logic: Excess coverage (IP covers 8+ periods), low demand regime, $1 holding vs $19 profit favors avoiding buildup; mirror recent 0-orders in high-inv periods; order 0.",
