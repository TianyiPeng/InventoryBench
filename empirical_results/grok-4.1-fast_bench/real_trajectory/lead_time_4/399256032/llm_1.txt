Date 2019-02-11 (Monday), near Valentine's Day (Feb 14) - minor potential uplift for women's apparel as gifts/outings, but jeans are year-round/staple, more winter-suited. No major spikes expected; historical data (Jan-Feb) shows rising demand possibly due to post-holiday refresh or early spring prep. (b) Historical demand: 51 (1/7), 64 (1/14), 75 (1/21), 99 (1/28), 145 (2/4) - strong upward trend (+25% to +46% WoW), accelerating; recent avg last 3 periods ~106, but momentum suggests P1 forecast ~160-180. No prior regimes, treat as emerging high-demand phase. (c) No order history, so no lead time or missing order data; promised LT=4 periods - first order arrives during P5 (visible P6). (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; P1 demand fully at risk of stockout (post-decision). Pipeline empty. (e) Order to cover protection interval (current P1 + LT=4 \u2192 5 periods) at ~170 avg forecast amid uptrend/Valentine's buffer: target ~850 total, but conservative first order builds pipeline without excess hold risk; place 200 (covers ~1-2 periods post-arrival + safety).
