{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed consistently as 4 periods across multiple arrivals (e.g., P46 no arrival as expected, P43 order=30 due in P47; no lost shipments evident). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=99, in-transit=30 (P43 order arriving during P47), total position=129 units pre-demand, ample for 12+ periods at recent ~10 demand/period.
