No lost shipments evident. Pipeline breakdown: In-transit 490 = P43 order 150 (arrives P47), P44 120 (P48), P45 0 (P49), P46 220 (P50). On-hand=0 entering P47. Demand analysis: Recent P42-P46 demands=232,72,79,228,144 (volatile holiday avg=151); P46=144 (Christmas week) down from P45=228 spike but still elevated vs fall avg~120. Current date 2019/12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's eve - expect demand moderation/taper (retail slowdown after holidays, jeans less urgent post-gifting), but volatility warrants caution to avoid P49 low coverage (0 incoming). Historical early-year (Jan) ~130 avg aligns with potential stabilization. OR rec=158 uses promised L=4 and full history (ignores recent volatility/seasonality), yielding reasonable base-stock order. Strategy: Follow OR unchanged - 158 covers ~1 period avg demand, bolsters P51 pipeline amid expected post-holiday ~100-150 demand; avoids overstock (holding $1) given current 0 on-hand and coverage through P50.",
