Matches carry-over P24 insight (+525% vs prior low). Stable high ~100-120, no new shift. Historical early-year samples (Jan-Feb ~80 avg) suggest possible annual cycle, but prioritize recent data. Forecast P27+: ~110. (c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (latest visible: prior arrivals). No missing/lost orders (all past orders concluded).
