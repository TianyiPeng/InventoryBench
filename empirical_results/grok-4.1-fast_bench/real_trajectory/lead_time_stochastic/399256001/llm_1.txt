Historical Feb highs ~300 pre-stock align with seasonal apparel upticks. (b) Demand regimes: Stable Oct-Nov ~215 avg (P39-41:222/220/209); P42 Black Friday outlier 467 (+117% vs prior avg), initiating holiday spike but 1pd only (not sustained 3pd). Forecast P43-47: 300-500/period (avg ~400, total ~2000) based on holiday calendar + BF signal, vs summer lows/back-to-school ~150-220. (c) Lead time: Historical 1-3pd variable (recent P32 LT3); promised 2 unreliable (~60% lost/delay). Recent: No arrivals since P35 (8pd dry); P40 order overdue 3pd (exp P42 LT2, absent P42); P41 overdue 2pd (exp P43); P42 pending. Losses sustained (e.g., P34/P29 confirmed lost), in-transit includes stuck lost orders. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 807 (~2pd at 400/dpd); in-transit 9000 unreliable (likely ~60% lost/stuck, minimal near-term arrivals expected). Post-P42 BF drawdown from 1274\u2192807 signals stockout risk if holiday demand persists without replenishment. (e) Order 900: Matches historical batch size; covers ~2pd expected demand arriving ~P45 (LT2-3), buffering holiday peaks P46-47 despite pipeline risk. Low holding ($1 vs $19 profit) favors overstock near endgame (5pd left, total exp demand 2000 > on-hand). Conservative vs demand surge, avoids stockout lost profit.",
