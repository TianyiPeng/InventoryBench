World knowledge: US winter (cold Dec), short-sleeved T-shirt demand suppressed by weather despite holiday gifting/shopping surge; no Thanksgiving spike observed (P42 demand=42 modest vs prior lows). Historical early-year highs (Jan-Feb ~130 avg) irrelevant now. (b) Demand regime: Early winter low deepened sustained P37-41 avg19 (<33, -50% vs prior); P42=42 (+121% fluctuation) single period, not sustained (needs 3+); forecast P43 ~25-45 low, no holiday spike evidence yet. (c) Lead time: Variability 1-3 sustained (recent P39 LT2, P36 LT3, P32 LT1/3); P42 arr=0 consistent (likely no major orders expected e.g. P40/41 orders=0); no new consecutive misses/losses sustained (isolated, fits variability). No overdue flags beyond known. (d) Inventory & pipeline: OH=80 covers 2-4 periods low demand (~30 avg); in-transit=2210 massive (accumulated pipeline, recent small orders P39=60 etc.); total supply vastly exceeds needs, risks huge holding costs ($1/unit/period) near game end (43/47). (e) Final order logic: Order 0; OH + pipeline overcovers low-demand horizon (5 periods left) with LT~2-3; prioritize minimizing holding vs minor stockout risk (profit=holding=$1); no demand uptick sustained to justify adding.",
