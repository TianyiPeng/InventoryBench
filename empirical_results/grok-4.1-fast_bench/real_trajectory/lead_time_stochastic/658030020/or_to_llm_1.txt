Inventory analysis: On-hand=117 covers ~1.5-2 periods at recent avg demand ~70 (P35-P39:78,71,64,82,56); in-transit=1046 unreliable due to lost shipments, actual near-term pipeline likely limited to recent orders like P38/120 (possible LT2 arrival P40), P39/100 (LT1 P40 or LT2 P41), plus any LT3 from P37 but already arrived elsewhere - net position vulnerable if no arrivals. Demand analysis: Fall volatility sustained (carry-over P32-P36 avg95 std~30, extended P32-P39 avg~84.5 over 8 periods std~28, +190% vs summer lows); P39=56 dip but volatile pattern holds; date=2019-11-11 (Mon) pre-Thanksgiving (11/28 ~P42) & Black Friday (11/29 ~P42), world knowledge: ladies stretch denim jeggings (casual lower body) likely see holiday shopping spike for gifting/casual wear, similar to early-year peaks (P1-5 avg~98). OR recommendation: 0 units - ignores lost shipments (assumes full pipeline coverage) & equal-weights all history (dilutes recent highs); OR underestimates due to bloated pipeline assumption.

Inventory analysis: On-hand=164 ample for 2+ periods at recent holiday avg~97 (P44-46: 99/106/85), covers P47-P48+ even if demand ~80-100; in-transit 1246 unreliable due to losses, but current on-hand buffers risk. Demand analysis: Product is ladies' push-up denim jeggings (fashion lower body); date 2019/12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week expects demand dip after sustained holiday peak (P44-P46 avg 96.7, +89% vs fall P32-P40 avg82 per carry-over), similar to post-Thanksgiving dip (P41-P43 avg54); no regime shift yet (single P46=85 not sustained decline). OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2/historical demand, appropriately conservative given high apparent pipeline/on-hand vs critical fractile (profit=4, holding=1, q=0.8). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - no need to order with 164u buffer for LT=2+1=3 periods demand (~250-300), avoids excess holding amid expected post-holiday taper and lost shipment risks; monitor P47 conclude for dip confirmation.",
