  "rationale": "(a) Product: Ladies push-up jeggings (stretch denim, skinny low-waist 5-pocket). Fashion apparel suitable for holiday parties/outfits/gifts. Date 2019/12/9: Mid-December pre-Christmas ramp-up (16 days to 12/25), post-Black Friday (11/29)/Cyber Monday (12/2=P43); expect demand spike like historical winter (Jan-Feb avg~70-100+, peaks 166-187) and Sep back-to-school (152). (b) Demand regime: Recent P39-P43: 56/60/52/66/45 (avg 56, volatile -7% to +27%); aligns with carry-over pre-holiday low stabilization. No sustained shift yet (holiday uptick anticipated but unconfirmed <3 periods). Forecast P44 ~60, rising to 100-150 peaks P45-47 (total remaining ~400-600). (c) Lead time/loss: Recent LT=1-3 (P40\u2192P43 LT3; P39\u2192P41 LT2; P36\u2192P39 LT3). Persistent high loss risk (e.g., P34 200 lost confirmed P41; historical 5+/10). In-transit 1500 includes lost shipments (never arrive, stay pending). No new overdues signalled in P43. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 426 (~7wk@60 or ~3 peaks@150). In-transit 1500 unreliable (partial arrivals expected, many lost). Covers base but vulnerable to spike + losses. (e) Order logic: 4 periods left (44-47), prioritize sales (profit $4 >> final holding $1). Order 200 buffers losses/stockouts (historical peaks caused stockouts e.g. P33); LT~2 arrives P46 sellable in holiday peaks, minimal final inv risk vs. missed profit.",
