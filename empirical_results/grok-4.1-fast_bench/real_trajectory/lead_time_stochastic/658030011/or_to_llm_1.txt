  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LT variable 1-3 periods (P43 conclude: P40 LT=3, P41 LT=2); sporadic losses confirmed ongoing (P39/130, P40/120, P41/130 lost past LT=3 in P42, inflating in-transit ghosts to 1279 total). Inventory analysis: On-hand 206 covers ~1.5-2 periods at recent high demand ~110; massive in-transit 1279 unreliable due to sustained loss pattern, so discount pipeline heavily. Demand analysis: High fall/holiday regime sustained P25-P42 avg~113 (up 200% from summer P18-P24 avg38); P43 demand=44 appears isolated post-Thanksgiving dip (Dec2), expect rebound to 100-150+ for Christmas peak (Period44 Dec9 aligns with holiday shopping ramp for ladies denim jeggings); historical early-year samples (83,67,107,53,116 avg~85) irrelevant now. OR recommendation: 0 units - underestimates seasonality/holiday surge, ignores losses/variable LT, over-relies on full-history mean pulled down by summer lows and bloated pipeline. Final strategy: Override OR to 150 units, targeting base-stock for (actual LT~2.5 +1)=3.5 periods coverage ~400 units (recent \u03bc~114 \xd73.5), compensating for unreliable pipeline/losses while avoiding excess holding (high on-hand buildup post-P43 low demand); aligns with recent order sizes (140-150) and holiday anticipation.",
