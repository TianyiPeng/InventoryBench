Dec 2, 2019 (P43): Cyber Monday (post-Black Friday Nov29/Thanksgiving Nov28), peak holiday shopping season into Christmas (Dec25). Jeans demand surges for gifts/winter apparel; historical early-year ~50-70 aligns with initial data, but calendar drives spikes (e.g., prior Memorial/July4/Thanksgiving boosts confirmed). (b) Demand regime: Fall high volatile ~75-95 (P31-41 avg~80, sustained); P42=268 (+235% vs fall avg) confirms holiday surge onset post-Thanksgiving, Cyber Monday P43 likely sustains 200+; forecast P43-47: 150-250 avg (holiday peak P45-47 ~250+), total ~900-1200. (c) LT/missing orders: Promised LT=2, actual 1-3 variable sustained (e.g., P32->P35 LT3, P36->P39 LT3); no arrivals P42 (expected none recent as ordered=0 P37-42); in-transit 1430u fully junk (old losses P1/3/4/10/14/17/20/23/24/26/27/29/32/33 sustained pattern, no resolutions); recent LT reliable but loss risk high ~20-30%. Order P43 expects arrival P45 (LT2) or P46 (LT3), visible P46/P47. (d) Inv/pipeline: On-hand 466 (covers ~2 periods at 200/demand); reliable pipeline=0 (all junk); high on-hand buffers P43-44 but depletes by P45 w/o orders; holding risk low near end (5 periods left). (e) Order logic: Aggressive order to pipeline for holiday peak P45-47 coverage (exp demand 750+ total rem), target 250u balancing LT=2-3 arrival, loss risk (effective ~200u), vs holding $1/u; avoids stockout lost profit $19/u during peak; conservative vs prior back-to-school 250-300.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand surge confirmed P42:268 (+235% vs P31-41 fall avg~80), sustained 1 period but Thanksgiving/Cyber Monday/Christmas calendar driver strong; monitor for 3p extension.",
