Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2; history shows variation (1-3 periods) with many losses (e.g., P37-P40 confirmed lost per carry-over), inflating in-transit to 1187 (mostly ghosts). Recent arrivals: P45 had P42(120,LT=3), P43(250,LT=2); P46 arrived=0, no new confirms. Inventory: On-hand=354 (high, covers 5+ periods at 70 demand), plus unreliable pipeline - no imminent stockout risk. Demand analysis: Holiday peak P40-P42 avg139 (Black Friday/Cyber); softening sustained P43-P46 avg69 (71,70,81,54, -50% vs peak), now post-Christmas P47 (2019/12/30) for jeans - expect continued low ~50-70 (no reversal observed, aligns with seasonal post-holiday drop). OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2 and full history (ignores losses/regimes); aligns perfectly with high stock and softening demand - no override needed. Strategy: Order 0 to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) on excess 354+ while ghosts persist; monitor P47 demand for further softening confirmation.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - on-hand 354 covers 5+ periods of expected post-Christmas low demand (~50-70, continuing P43-P46 softening avg69); unreliable in-transit ghosts make additional orders risky for holding costs.",
