Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals confirm LT variability (LT=2 or 3), e.g., P45: P42 order LT=3, P43 LT=2; P43: P40 LT=3, P41 LT=2. Pipeline unreliability persists per carry-over (many losses, e.g., P44 insight), with 1546 in-transit likely including overdue orders, but no new conclusive losses beyond P45 (P42/P43 arrived). Inventory: On-hand 321 sufficient for 6+ periods at recent demand ~50 (P43-46:52,52,50,52 avg 51.5). Demand analysis: Post-Christmas (2019/12/30), low demand sustained (carry-over P40-41 decline to ~53 avg pre-holidays; P43-46 stable ~52 despite P42 141 spike possibly Thanksgiving/early holiday). Women's blouse demand low end-of-year, no major events boosting (New Year's minor). OR recommends 0 using promised LT=2 and full history (ignores losses/delays/regimes); aligns perfectly with high on-hand and low demand outlook - no override needed. Strategy: Order 0 to avoid adding to unreliable pipeline and accumulating holding costs.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - on-hand 321 covers 6+ periods of sustained low demand (~52 recent avg, post-Christmas lull for women's blouses); unreliable pipeline (1546 units) adds buffer despite losses.",
