(c) LT: Variable/unreliable per carry-over (1-3 periods, disruptions/streaks, partial resumptions e.g. P39 odd LT=2 arrived P41 vs prior LT1; P37 odd LT1 P38); no new arrivals P40 but P41 arrival confirms ongoing variability, no confirmed losses recently; in-transit inflated historically by losses but recent deliveries (monitor P42 conclude for P40/P41 orders). (d) Inv & pipeline: OH=239 (~1.3w at 179 or 1w at 250); in-transit=2570 (massive, covers 15w+ demand even if partial losses/delays); total supply ample but LT risk could delay coverage for P42-43 spikes. (e) Order logic: Order 250 to buffer Black Friday spike risk (OH covers base but vulnerable to 250+ demand if low P42 arrival), conservative vs pipeline excess/holding costs ($1/u/period, 5 periods left); aligns recent order sizes (P41=250), targets service while avoiding overstock (projected ending inv low post-demand).",

Apparel like jeans sees gifting/party demand spikes in Dec (post-BF/Cyber P42-43), aligning with historical high-demand winter refresh (e.g., back-to-school peaks P30-34 avg323). BF P42=506 confirms holiday volatility for fashion bottoms.\n(b) Demand regime analysis: Holiday peak confirmed (P42=506 +182% vs P35-41 avg179). Post-BF cooldown P43-44 avg112 (-78% vs P42, but only 2 periods, seasonal context expects Christmas uptick P45-47 ~200-400+ based on BF pattern/BTS peaks; prior stable P35-41 ~179, P38-41 ~169 avg. Forecast P45 ~180 (moderate ramp), P46-47 potential 300-500 spikes. Volatility high (std dev ~120 recent).\n(c) Lead_time vs. missing orders: LT unreliable/disrupted (carry-over: ongoing streaks, no P44 arrival despite exp P43 odd LT1/P42 even LT2; recent ex P41 odd LT=2 P43, P39 odd LT=2 P41 vs prior LT1 pattern). Promised LT=2, observed 1-3 variable. No new arrivals P44 (reinforces); in-transit bloat suggests cumulative delays/losses (e.g., P43 500u overdue past LT1 P44, possible LT2 P45?). Lost shipments persist in-transit indefinitely.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: OH=27 critically low (post P44: start140 -113demand=27). In-transit=3470 massively bloated (holding ~$3470/period risk, but endgame 3 periods left mitigates; mix delayed arrivals/losses). Potential P45 arrivals: P43(500u odd possible LT2), others overdue. Pipeline covers far excess if arrives, but disruptions risk gaps.\n(e) Final order logic: Low OH=27 risks full P45 stockout (lost ~$720 profit at 180demand). Huge pipe risky for holding but LT disruptions justify safety order. Endgame (P45-47), new order (LT1-2) minimal extra holding (1-2p $100-800 vs $1600+ sales).
