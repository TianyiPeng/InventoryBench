  "rationale": "(a) Product: Women's soft knit sweater/jumper (nightwear/underwear category but upper body garment), highly seasonal for winter. Date 2019/12/23 (Mon): Christmas week (Dec 25 Wed), peak holiday gifting/cold weather demand driver for sweaters; expect sharp surge overriding recent lull (historical fall peaks ~200-300, holiday potentially 300-500+ vs recent ~60). (b) Demand regime: Recent P42-45: 149 (Thanksgiving surge), then P43-P45 avg 63 (71/60/59, -58% drop post-Thanksgiving), confirming late Nov/early Dec lull; but Christmas overrides to high regime ~250-400 forecast based on seasonal calendar + fall peaks (P33=307, P31-33 avg202) + gifting uplift. Historical early-year data (P1-5 avg ~110) irrelevant now. (c) Lead time: Recent confirms mixed LT=1-3 (P45: LT3/2; P43: LT3/2; P36 reconfirmed LT3); no new losses (recent orders P40-43 arrived P43/45); P44(400u) expected P46/47 (LT2-3), P45(400u) P47/48; sustained unreliability but recent reliability holds. No overdue signals. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 1784 (covers 4-7wks at 250-400/wk), in-transit 2350 (likely P44=400 soon + P45=400 + possibly others), total ~4134 (10+wks coverage); post-P45 ending 1784 after low demand confirms buffer ample vs peaks. (e) Final order logic: Order 400 to sustain pipeline amid LT variability/loss risk, cover Christmas peak + post-holiday winter (Jan demand historically ~110 avg), balance service (avoid stockout like P33/34) vs holding ($1/u low vs $19 profit); high current stock minimizes overorder risk.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand pre-Christmas lull sustained P43-P45 avg 63/period (71,60,59; -58% vs P42 Thanksgiving 149), confirming post-Thanksgiving decline into holiday buildup.",
