Recent concludes P20-P21 arrived=0; P22 arrivals unknown but likely low given pattern. Pipeline won't reliably cover.

Losses pattern: P29(100) now confirmed lost (ordered P29, no arr by P32 conclude LT=3 elapsed vs recent 1-3); in-transit 1435 inflated by accumulated historical losses (never clear 'in-transit').

Effective coverage strong short-term but discount losses/ramp risk. (e) Order logic: Conservative 100 to replenish losses (P29 lost), buffer fall ramp (seasonal uptick imminent), avoid overstock (276 high holding risk if trough lingers) while pipeline partially covers; matches recent low-order success (100s arriving LT1-3).",
