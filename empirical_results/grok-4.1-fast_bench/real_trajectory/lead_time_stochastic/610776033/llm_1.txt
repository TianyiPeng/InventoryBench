No major T-shirt boosts from Christmas/Chanukah; historical winter trough (Nov-Dec) confirmed deep low. (b) Demand regime: Winter trough sustained deep low (carry-over P36-P42: deepening to avg 22.5 P38-P41); recent P42(64 Thanksgiving?), P43(63 post-BF), P44(12) mixed/spiky but reverts low - no sustained shift (P42-P44 avg~46 volatile, not 3+ consistent); forecast P45 ~15-25 (trough extension). (c) Lead time/missing: No new orders since P32; prior all lost (effective in-transit 0 per P35 carry-over); 2500 in-transit = ghost/overstated lost orders (no arrivals since P35); LT variable 1-3 but irrelevant w/o pipeline. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 180 (P44 ending); effective pipeline 0; covers ~10 periods at 20 demand/period (3 periods left: total exp demand ~60); slow depletion (P33:603 \u2192 P44:180 over 12p). (e) Order logic: High on-hand vs critically low demand + endgame (45/47) = no order needed; avoid adding to holding costs ($1/unit/period) on excess inv (R_t penalized by ending inv); service assured, order 0 to liquidate slowly.",
