Variability persists (LT=1 or 2), but lost shipment pattern dominates: longstanding overdues (e.g., P10 200u 12+ periods past expected P12, P21 250u expected P23 LT=2 but pattern suggests likely lost). Effective pipeline ~0 despite 1652 in-transit (all unaccounted as lost per carry-over). Step 2: Inventory & demand analysis. OH=9 (low, will stockout P23 ~100 demand). No reliable near-term arrivals expected (P21 250 expected P23 LT=2 unreliable; P22 250 expected P24+). Recent demand sustained uptick mid-summer for jersey skirts: P16-22 demands [85,73,81,99,162,111,91] avg 100.3 (+87% vs P13-15 avg 53), aligns with July peak seasonal for skirts (post-Easter normalization complete, summer steady). Initial historical ~80 irrelevant. Step 3: OR recommendation. OR=0 due to naive pipeline view (ignores losses, uses promised L=2 + old historical demand ~80). Step 4: Strategy. Override OR aggressively: treat effective inv=9, forecast 3-period (L+1=3) demand ~300 (100*3), safety for var/LT/losses +100 (z~0.8 fractile 4/(4+1), sigma~30 \u2192 +~80), target base ~400, order=400-9=391 but cap conservatively at recent successful orders (250) to avoid overstock if rare delivery.

Inventory analysis: On-hand=120 covers ~1 period at recent demand ~158, high risk of stockout in P45/P46 Christmas peak; effective pipeline=0, so inventory position=120 critically low.
