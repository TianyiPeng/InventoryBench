(b) Demand regime: Steady mean ~157 with variance; recent increase (Jan28-Feb4: +40% from prior low 105), but only 2-3 points\u2014not yet sustained (needs 3+ consistent).

(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; P1 demand fully stocked out (post-decision). No arrivals until P3 (if LT=2). Pipeline empty. (e) Final order logic: Since profit=holding=1/period, target zero ending inv long-term but cover LT+1=3 periods ahead (P3-P5) to build pipeline and minimize future stockouts.

(b) Demand regime: Low regime persists/deepens - P29-32 avg81 (109,74,72,70) vs P25-31 avg~94 (-14%), new lows 70-74; sustained <110 over 8+ periods P25-32 (vs early-year 150-200, P18-20 324). Forecast P33: ~70-90, continuing fall drop. (c) Lead time/missing orders: LT variability 1-3 sustained (last: P23 LT3 P26, P25 LT2 P27); no P32 arrival (normal, recent order P32=300 expected P34-35). Losses sustained (11+ cases per carry-over, e.g., P24 confirmed); in-transit=3290 bloated by indefinite lost shipments (pattern: persist forever, effective pipeline lower). No new LT obs or losses confirmed in P32. (d) Inv & pipeline: On-hand=567 (P32 end), covers ~6-8 periods at 80/demand even w/o arrivals. In-transit=3290 unreliable (historical losses inflate); recent pipeline sparse post-P27. High on-hand risks holding costs ($1/unit/period). (e) Order logic: Demand low (~80), on-hand ample (567 >> forecast*4 periods buffer), bloated/unreliable pipeline, LT variability/loss risk \u2192 order 0 to minimize holding vs service (no stockouts risk).",

  "rationale": "(a) Product: Women's basic jersey T-shirt (everyday upper body garment). World/calendar: 2019-12-16 (mid-Dec, pre-Christmas week). T-shirts are summer/fall wear; winter demand trough persists (cooler weather suppresses); no Christmas gift spike expected for basics (unlike holiday-specific apparel). Aligns with seasonal decline confirmed in carry-over (late Oct-early Dec <50, now early-mid Dec).\n(b) Demand regime: Stable winter low sustained <50 over 10+ periods (P33-42 avg~34 per carry-over); recent P41-44: 25,47,20,19 (avg~28, -18% vs prior); P42=47 possible Thanksgiving blip, then drop to ~20 consistent with deepening trough but not yet 3-period new regime. Forecast P45: ~20-25 (low plateau).\n(c) Lead time: Variability 1-3 periods sustained (recent LT=3 P32->35); high loss risk (11+ cases, lost stay in-transit inflating to 2990u ghosts). No recent orders (last P32), so no expected arrivals; no new LT/loss data.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=413 (high, covers ~20 periods at 20-25 demand); in-transit=2990u ineffective (lost backlog per carry-over, effective pipeline~0). No imminent arrivals; excess on-hand will draw down naturally over remaining 3 periods (45/47 total).\n(e) Order logic: Low forecast (~25), ample on-hand (413 >> 75 needed for P45-47), high holding cost ($1/u/p), loss risk, endgame (2 periods left). Order 0 to avoid adding to inventory/phantom transit; prioritize drawdown to minimize cumulative holding penalties.",

  "rationale": "(a) Women's basic lightweight jersey T-shirt: Seasonal winter demand trough confirmed (late Dec 2019/12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's Eve); T-shirts near-zero in cold weather, aligns with carry-over fall/winter decline from summer highs; historical Jan 2019 avg~157 irrelevant as current regime overrides with evidence of sustained lows <50 since Sep. (b) Demand regime: Stable deep winter low; recent P43-46 avg 24 (20,19,35,22) vs P38-42 avg~34 (-29%), extending <30 over 4 periods/14+ total; plateaued 19-35, no uptick signals despite holidays. Forecast P47-50: 20-30/period conservative. (c) Lead time: Stabilized variability 1-3 periods (last P32->P35 LT=3); no new orders since P32 so no arrivals expected soon; sustained loss pattern (11+ cases) means in-transit 2990 inflated by lost shipments (persist indefinitely), effective pipeline ~0 reliable units; no overdue new orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 356 covers ~12-18 periods at 20-30 demand (total drop P35-46: 747->356 matches ~391 demand); no reliable in-transit arrivals imminent; high buffer absorbs holding cost ($1/unit) short-term. (e) Final order logic: Order 0 to minimize new exposure to LT variability/loss risk (11+ cases); rely on ample on-hand buffer through winter trough; holding cost offset by avoiding lost orders, prep for potential spring uptick without overstock.",
