Historical data (Jan-Feb 2019): 557,438,489,500,649 (mean=527, recent uptick to 649 on 2019-02-04). Date 2019-02-11 (Mon), post-Chinese New Year (Feb 5), no major Western holidays; minor pre-Valentine (Feb 14) lift possible but jeans not primary gift. Expect steady ~500-650 demand. (b) Demand regime: No in-game history (Period 1); anchor to historical mean 527, trending up (last=649, +23% vs prior avg). No sustained shift yet. (c) Lead time: Promised 2 periods; no concluded arrivals to infer actual or losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. P1 & P2 demand will stockout fully. P1 order arrives P3 (if LT=2), before P3 demand. No overdue orders. (e) Final order logic: Order to cover ~3 periods demand post-arrival (LT+1 coverage) at 550 avg (historical mean + recent bias), safety 10-20% for variance/possible LT drift/stockouts costing $4 vs hold $1. Total: 3*550 + 100 safety = 1750? Conservative ramp: start with 700 (covers ~P3-P5 demand + buffer, avoids excess hold early while building pipeline via future orders).",

Late Sep 2019 (P34: 2019/9/30) \u2013 fall shoulder season; jeans demand rebounds post-summer as weather cools, aligning with observed fall patterns (back-to-school tail-end possible, Halloween buildup distant). Matches initial historical data ~500 avg (Jan-Feb 2019). (b) Demand regime: Fall rebound sustained P27-33 avg480 (+81% vs P22-26 summer avg265, 7 periods); recent P30-33: 526/540/451/781 avg575 (spike P33=781 highest recorded, potential further upside but 1-period). Prior summer dip ~265 confirmed low; no new regime shift beyond extended fall high ~450-600. (c) Lead-time/missing orders: Promised LT=2 variable (recent: LT1-2 e.g. P32 arrivals P30 LT2/P31 LT1; sporadic LT3 P26; historical losses P1/3/4/10+ overdues). P33 arr=0 (expected P31 LT2/P32 LT1=500 but none); disruptions persist but resumed P32; in-transit 4800 signals many pending/overdues/lost inflating pipeline. No confirmed new LT shift. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout risk P34); in-transit=4800 (~8-10 periods at 480-600 demand, high holding exposure). Expected P34 arr: P32 o=500 (LT2), possibles from earlier pending (e.g. P33 o=0 LT1 none); prior patterns suggest partial arrivals. (e) Order logic: On-hand=0 + recent high demand (~550) risks stockout, but massive pipeline covers 8+ periods even at LT=2-3; order conservative 400 to buffer delays/losses + upside demand without exploding holding costs ($1/unit/period on 4800+ already risky); targets service while pipeline digests.",

Holiday season drives apparel demand spikes for gifting/festive wear; P42 (11/25 Thanksgiving/Black Friday)=1366 confirms holiday surge capability, P43 (12/02 Cyber Monday post-dip)=306 low but expect ramp-up P44-P47 toward Christmas. Matches historical early-year avg~500 but seasonal highs possible. (b) Demand regime: Pre-holiday low sustained P35-41 avg314 (~250-350); P42 holiday spike +370%; P43 dip 306; now Dec holiday ramp expected ~450-600+ (fall high regime P27-33 avg480 extended contextually), vs summer lows ~250-350. Recent P39-43: avg 505 but volatile (lows 257-308, highs 1366). Forecast P44 ~400-500 (post-dip ramp), rising to 600-1000 P45-47. (c) Lead-time/missing: Variability LT1-3 confirmed (e.g., P41\u2192P43 LT2, P36\u2192P39 LT3, P37\u2192P38 LT1); disruptions easing (recent arrivals, no new losses P40-43 despite prior gaps), but P40-42 no-arr noted. No prolonged absences beyond LT3; in-transit steady high ~4700-5100 signals delays not losses. Promised LT2 holds avg. (d) Inv/pipeline: On-hand 94 (low, risks P44 stockout if >94 demand); in-transit 4700 massive (covers 10+ periods at 400 avg demand, ~1175/period if spread LT1-3). Recent arr P43=400 (P41); expect clustered arrivals P44-46 from pending (e.g., P39/P40? orders inferred pending). Ending inv P43=94 low post-sale. (e) Order logic: High pipeline 4700+on-hand94 covers remaining 4 periods (est total demand 2000-3000) amply despite LT variability; adding orders risks excess holding ($1/unit/period) as game nears end (P44/47). Order 0 prioritizes avoiding overstock vs minor P44 stockout risk (94 buffer, post-dip demand ~400 feasible); monitor arrivals P44 conclude for adjustments.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand volatility confirmed: P42 spike 1366 (+370% vs P35-41 avg290), P43 post-dip 306, Dec ramp expected (1 period evidence); no new sustained regime shift.",
