In-transit=1312 is extreme backlog (up from prior peaks), with recent deliveries (500 units P35-P36) showing some improvement but historical high loss rate (e.g., P29-P30 lost) means cannot fully rely on pipeline arriving intact. Step 2: Inventory & demand analysis - On-hand=0 after P37 stockout (demand=185, sold=131); recent demand sustained high in peak fall hoodie season late Oct: P33-P37 avg 245 (374,259,240,169,185), up +10% from P34-P36 avg 223, confirming ongoing seasonal surge into cooler weather/possible Halloween; historical early-year data irrelevant now. Expected demand next 3-4 periods (covering LT+1): ~250/period x4=1000 units; massive in-transit may cover if low loss, but stockouts persist (P37 lost ~54 sales). Step 3: OR recommendation - 0 units, likely due to high historical/pipeline in base-stock calc using promised LT=2 and full history (ignores recent surge, losses, LT variability); OR underestimates fall peak. Step 4: Strategy - Override OR's 0 with 300 units to buffer against losses/variability, matching prior successful orders (e.g., P35=300 arrived quickly LT=1); ensures coverage for ~1-2 periods demand atop backlog, minimizing holding risk since on-hand=0 and profit=19>>holding=1.

Inventory: On-hand 195 covers ~1 period at recent avg demand ~240 but risks stockout in P45 if demand >195 (like P44=249); massive pipeline 1912 provides buffer but history of losses (e.g., multi-period streaks) and LT delays warrant caution. Demand analysis: Peak fall/winter hoodie surge sustained into pre-Christmas (2019/12/16, week before Dec 25); recent P42-P44 demands 690/156/249 (avg 365, +38% vs prior P33-P41 avg 217); holiday gifting/cold weather drives continued high/volatility (expect 250-400+ for P45-P47). OR recommends 0 (base-stock covered by historical mean/pipeline assuming promised LT=2, ignores recent surge/seasonality/losses). Strategy: Override OR upward to 300 units (matching past peak orders like P39-41) to buffer 1-2 periods demand (~500-600 total) amid losses/LT risk; low holding ($1) vs high profit ($19), near endgame (45/47), prioritizes avoiding stockouts (e.g., P42 lost 603 sales).

No new overdue confirmations in P45 conclude. Inventory: On-hand 238u risks stockout in P46 if demand exceeds ~250 (recent P43-P45 avg 221, but P42=690 Black Friday spike; overall P42-P45 avg 338).

Expect P46 demand 300-500+ (holiday peak like P42=690). Historical early data irrelevant; seasonal winter/Christmas drives surge. OR recommendation: 0u (conservative, assumes promised L=2, full historical mean, sufficient pipeline > base-stock ~mu_hat=3*~200?=600 + safety). Override: OR underestimates holiday peak and loss risk; order 300u (matching recent successful replenishments P43/P45) to cover post-P46 (arrives ~P48-49) amid expected continued high demand into holiday/weekend, low holding cost justifies buffer vs stockout loss ($19p/u).
