{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent concluded arrivals show LT variability sustained (e.g., P40 order LT=3 arrived P43; P41 LT=2 arrived P43; P39 LT=2 arrived P41); losses confirmed for overdue 2+ periods (pattern sustained, total lost 448+ units). No new arrivals in P45 conclude as expected (no orders due LT=2 from P43/44). Promised LT=2, but plan for 2-3 periods coverage due to delays/losses. Inventory: On-hand=16 (low, risks stockout P46); in-transit=528 (high but unreliable - sustained loss pattern means effective pipeline lower, many likely lost/overdue). Demand analysis: Date 2019/12/23 = Christmas week; product maternity leggings sees holiday volatility per carry-over (spikes P33=114 Thanksgiving, P42=129 late Nov BF, followed by dips P43-45 avg48 (-62% vs spike), high variance ~35 P40-44). P45=47 confirms post-spike dip; P46 anticipates repeat Christmas spike ~120 (matching prior peaks), then possible P47 dip ~50. Historical initial avg~66, but seasonal shifts confirmed (summer low, fall recovery, Nov softening, holiday volatile). OR rec=0 (uses promised LT=2, full history mean/variance, ignores losses/seasonality/volatility - underestimates need with low on-hand). Strategy: Override to 120 units for (L+1)=3 periods coverage (~120 P46 spike + 50 P47 dip + safety 50 for loss/volatility), targeting base-stock ~220 (mean 80 recent volatile *3 + z*sigma ~0.84*50), minus unreliable pipeline/on-hand ~16. Ensures no stockout during spike despite losses; holding cost low vs profit/loss.",

  "carry_over_insight": "Pre-Christmas dip P43-45 avg 48.3 (-63% vs P42 spike 129), low demand sustained 3 periods into mid-Dec for maternity leggings; holiday volatility pattern (spike-dip cycle) extended - monitor P46-47 Christmas for spike confirmation.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LTs variable 1-3 periods (e.g., P40->P43 LT=3, P41->P43 LT=2, confirmed in P43 conclude); promised LT=2 still relevant baseline, no new concluded arrivals in P46 (expected from recent orders pending); loss pattern sustained (total 448 units lost historically), but no new overdues visible yet (e.g., P45 order=80 expected P47 if LT=2, arrives after this decision; P46=120 expected P48). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 risky for immediate demand, but in-transit=648 massive (covers ~14 periods at recent avg demand 46); recent no arrivals P44-46, so pipeline building from P39+, P40-P46 orders undelivered yet. Demand analysis: Recent P43-46 avg 46.5 (43,54,47,42), low variance, sustained post-Thanksgiving/Christmas dip (-64% vs P42 spike=129); holiday volatility pattern (spike-dip) confirmed no Christmas spike (P45-46 avg44.5 low); date 2019/12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's likely continued low for maternity leggings (non-gift seasonal item, entering Jan slow). Historical initial ~66, but summer low P16-29 ~46, fall recovery P30-37 ~81, Nov softening P36-41 ~60, holiday spike-dip. OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2 & full history (ignores recency/losses), aligns with high pipeline & recent low demand regime. Strategy: Follow OR 0 - no order needed; 648 pipeline buffers LT variability/losses & covers 10+ periods low demand (~46); avoid adding to holdings given $1/period cost & on-hand=0 but imminent arrivals likely (P45/P46 orders).
