Socks practical for winter/gifts/stock-up; expect demand uptick vs low regime (cold weather + holidays), but basic not flashy gift. Historical Jan~34 avg similar winter base. (b) Demand: Winter low regime P36-41 avg~42 stable (carry-over), P42=101 spike (+138% vs prior avg, range confirms volatility 33-101 P36-42 avg~57 skewed high). Holiday signal emerging but 1pd only (not sustained); forecast P43 ~70 (modest holiday lift + volatility buffer from 45-100 range). (c) Lead time/missing: Promised LT2, actual 1-3 observed recently (P41: LT2 P39->P41; P39: LT3 P36->P39; P38: LT1); sustained multi-order loss pattern (carry-over, e.g., P40 100 likely lost overdue past LT2 no arr P42-42). P42 arr=0 confirms no recent arrivals; in-transit 1780 phantom accumulation (losses indefinite). No reliable P43 arrivals expected (P41 order60 exp P43 LT2 unconfirmed/risk lost). (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout risk P43), in-transit=1780 unreliable (mostly lost per pattern). Pipeline deficit: no credible inflows near-term, must order to rebuild post-P42 stockout. (e) Order logic: Target cover 3pd horizon (LT2+1, adj losses/volatility) at ~70pd x3=210, but conservative 100 vs holding risk/profit bal (recent small orders 60 sufficed lows but missed P42; holiday upside justifies modest up).",
