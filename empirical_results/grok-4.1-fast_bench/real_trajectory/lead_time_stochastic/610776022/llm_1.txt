(c) Lead-time/missing: Promised LT2, but sustained losses (carry-over P45: no arrivals P37-P45=9 periods, 3400 intransit stagnant); last arrival P36 (P35 LT1); no new LT inferences, reinforces total shipment failure pattern\u2014treat intransit as lost.

{
  "rationale": "(a) Product is women's everyday basic jersey T-shirt (upper body garment). Date 2019/12/30 (Mon, post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week). Winter in Northern Hemisphere suppresses T-shirt demand (indoor layering preferred); no holiday uplift for basics as gifts favor seasonal items. Historical high demand Jan-Feb (avg~162) shifted to ultra-low winter collapse (single digits since Oct). (b) Demand regime: Sustained winter bottom confirmed; P44-P46: 3,8,5 (avg5.3, -60% vs P37-P39 avg21); P43-P46 avg5.5 continues pre-Christmas collapse (P43-45 avg6); no rebound post-holiday, aligns with seasonal suppression for summer item. Forecast P47: ~3-6 units. (c) Lead-time/missing orders: Sustained loss/delay pattern; no arrivals P37-P46 (10 straight periods, arrived=0 each conclude) despite in-transit 3400 stagnant; prior losses (e.g., P1,P3-P4,P8-P10 etc.) unresolved; LT variable (1-3) when arrives, but promised 2 irrelevant amid chronic losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 203 (from P46 end) covers 30-60+ periods at ~5/demand; in-transit 3400 phantom/lost (no movement 10+ periods, accumulation since ~P17); high holding risk but no stockouts imminent. (e) Order 0: Excess on-hand buffers ultra-low demand indefinitely; unreliable supplier risks adding to lost pipeline; prioritize avoiding holding costs on new orders amid demand trough.",
