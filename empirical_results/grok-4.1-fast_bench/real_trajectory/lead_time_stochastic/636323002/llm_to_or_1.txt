Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11): First period, on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Product is ladies ankle-length denim jeans. Historical weekly demands: 2019-01-07:1, 01-14:3, 01-21:27, 01-28:17, 02-04:34. Clear changepoint after 01-14 (demand jumps from avg=2 to avg=26, +1200%), sustained over last 3 periods (regime_length=3). Use recent_3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture rising demand regime. L=default (promised=2, no observed lead times yet). No conclude messages, no shipments to reconcile. Parameters ensure higher mu_hat~(1+2)*26=78 covers elevated demand over 3 periods with high service (q=19/20=0.95), recent sigma for appropriate safety stock; balances profit vs holding by avoiding understocking rising sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-01-21: avg increased from 2 (first 2 weeks) to 26 (+1200%) sustained over 3 weeks

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18), ladies skinny ankle denim jeans. Sustained high demand regime since 2019-01-21 (carry-over: avg~26 over 3 weeks, confirmed by P1 demand=43 post-Valentine's). On-hand=0, in-transit=41 (P1 order, arrived=0 normal for L>=1, no conclude yet so no overdue/loss). No observed lead times. Use default L (promised=2). Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (changelpoint at 2019-01-21, regime length>=4 with P1; hist samples 27,17,34: mean=26, std~8.54). Yields mu_hat=3*26=78, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*8.54~14.8. Base_stock~78+1.645*14.8~103 (q=19/20=0.95). Pipeline=41 \u2192 order~62 (capped if needed), covers ~3 periods high demand (~30/period), pulls backend forecast up from default mu=49 (all-sample mean16.4*3), balances service vs holding.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25): Late February, ladies skinny ankle jeans; no major holidays, but demand regime shift from early Jan low (avg 2) to high (avg 26+) confirmed and escalating with P1 demand=43, P2=179 (recent avg ~111). On-hand=0, in-transit=95 (P1 order=41 due P3 arrival post-decision, P2=54 due P4). No concluded arrivals yet, so no LT observations; default L=2 expected. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat capturing regime since 2019-01-21 (demands 27,17,34,43,179; mean=60, high std~67), yielding mu_hat~(1+2)*60=180 to cover ~3 periods high demand and build base stock against stockouts (0 sales prior periods). High service q~19/(19+1)=0.95 prioritizes avoiding lost sales over holding; recent stats bridge backend's use of full historical low-mean data.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, no major retail events; ladies ankle denim jeans, demand likely steady but recent surge. On-hand:0, in-transit:266 (P1:41 overdue-expected P3 arrive but arrived=0 in P3 conclude; P2:54 expected P4; P3:171 expected P5). No arrivals P1-3. Recent demands P1-3:43,179,136 (avg=119.33, std=69.51), sustained high vs historical post-01-21 avg~26. L: default (promised 2; one overdue but not prolonged/multiple evidence for change). mu_hat: explicit 358=(1+2)*119.33 to capture recent high mean over review+lead. sigma_hat: explicit 120=sqrt(3)*69.51 for high volatility. Raises base_stock~358+1.645*120~555 >266 pipeline (orders~289), ensures high service (q=0.95) despite stockouts/missing arrivals, limits excess holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1 (2019-02-11): avg increased from 26 (2019-01-21 to 02-04) to 119 (+358%) sustained over 3 periods (43,179,136)

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), early March, no major holidays for ladies denim jeans; steady seasonal demand expected post-winter. Demand regime high since P1 (43,179,136,67; avg 106, previously noted shift to ~119 over first 3). P4 demand=67 lower (-44%) but single period, not sustained changepoint (needs 3+). P1 order=41 overdue (placed P1, expected arrive P3/visible P4, absent from P4 conclude, still in-transit), likely lost; adjust indirectly via demand focus. One LT observed=2 (P2 order in P4). Pipeline=446 (P1:41 lost?, P3:171 exp P5, P4:234 exp P6) covers ~3-4 periods at recent avg. Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high-demand regime (N=4=max(min(4,20),3)); default L=2 (matches sole observation, no sustained LT shift). Ensures base_stock targets service for volatile high demand while pipeline buffers holdings.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18), early spring; ladies skinny ankle jeans (denim trousers) likely softening post-winter peak as no major events (St. Patrick's past). Demands: P1-5: 43,179,136,67,35 (recent drop P4-5 avg51 vs P1-3 avg119, but only 2 periods not sustained). On-hand 0, in-transit 497 = P1:41 (overdue since P3, likely lost), P3:171 (overdue since P5, likely lost), P4:234 (due P6 LT2), P5:51 (due P7). Confirmed LT=2 (P2 order arrived P4). L default (promised 2 confirmed once). mu_hat recent_5 (N=5, regime post-upward shift ~P1, length5>3; backend 3*92=276 covers high mean despite drop). sigma_hat recent_5 (volatility from peaks). Boosts base_stock vs default low initial samples (mean16), higher service for losses/stockouts, balances high profit q=19/20.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), late March, ladies skinny ankle jeans. Recent demand P4-6: 67,35,52 (avg 51, down -57% from P1-3 avg 119), suggesting downward regime shift sustained 3 periods. No major calendar events imminent (Easter ~4/21). On-hand=0, in-transit=446 (likely P1:41 overdue 4p past exp P3; P3:171 overdue 2p past P5; P4:234 overdue 1p past P6), indicating delayed shipments beyond promised LT=2, not yet concluded as arrived (potential losses if prolonged). Observed LTs: P2-order LT=2, P5-order LT=1. L=explicit 3 to bridge OR backend's lack of awareness of delays/missing arrives, increasing base-stock horizon to cover extended LT risk. mu_hat=recent_3 captures lower demand regime (backend: 4*51=204), sigma_hat=recent_3 for reduced recent volatility (std~13 vs all-sample higher). Balances high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding by tempering mean down but safety up via longer L, leveraging pipeline buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward at Period 4 (2019-03-04): avg decreased from 119 (P1-3:43,179,136) to 51 (-57%) sustained over 3 periods (P4-6:67,35,52); Delayed shipment pattern: P1/P3/P4 orders (41/171/234) still in-transit, overdue 4/2/1 periods past promised LT=2

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): Early spring, ladies skinny ankle denim jeans; no major holidays imminent (Easter ~4/21), expect steady/possible mild uptick in spring fashion but recent demand downward regime sustained P4-7 (67,35,52,41 avg 48.75, std~14). Pipeline 446 = P1:41 (placed P1, overdue 5+ past LT=2), P3:171 (overdue 3+), P4:234 (overdue 2+); prolonged absence signals likely lost shipments (no conclude messages), making pipeline unreliable/unusable. On-hand=0, recent sales misses. Observed LTs: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6). To bridge OR backend's lack of lost order awareness and high illusory pipeline, set explicit L=5 > promised 2 to extend horizon, inflating base_stock ~560 (default mu_hat=6*52.9~318 + z*~242 using all-history mean 52.9/std~60) >446 for order ~114 (near cap~152). Defaults for mu/sigma leverage full history avg close to recent regime, balancing service vs holding; high L hedges supply risk without over-forecasting demand.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments confirmed: P1 order (41u) overdue 5 periods past LT=2, P3 (171u) overdue 3 periods; pattern sustained with no arrivals despite multiple periods past promised.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring, ladies ankle denim jeans; no major calendar events driving demand spikes. Demand in downward regime since P4 (chngpt confirmed in carry-over), avg 58.8 over 5 periods (P4-8:67,35,52,41,99), volatile but sustained lower than prior 119 avg (P1-3). On-hand=0, pipeline=532 (P1:41 overdue~6pd past LT2, P3:171 overdue~4pd, P4:234 overdue~3pd, P8:86 recent) covers ~9pd demand, suggesting lost/delayed pattern persists (no new arrivals). Observed LTs only 2: LT=2 (P2->P4), LT=1 (P5->P6). Use 'calculate' for L to avg observed LT=1.5 (backend adjusts base_stock for shorter actual LT). 'recent_N' N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures recent regime (lowers mu_hat from full-hist higher mean, reduces new orders amid high pipeline; high q=19/20=0.95 ensures service despite losses/stockouts).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15), mid-spring, ladies skinny ankle denim jeans; Easter Sunday on 04-21 likely to drive apparel demand spike this week (P8 demand=99 possible precursor, historical spikes to 179/136). Recent demand regime P4-P9 avg=54 (67,35,52,41,99,32), volatile std~23/pd. On-hand=0, in-transit=532 overstated: P1(41 overdue~9pd), P3(171 overdue~7pd), P4(234 overdue~6pd) likely lost (+sustained pattern), effective pipeline~86 (P8 order). Ongoing stockouts. Observed LTs: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), avg=1.5 but losses imply longer effective LT/risk. Set L explicit=3 to buffer delays/losses (1+L=4pd coverage). mu_hat explicit=500 (~125/pd elevated for Easter spike + historical peaks; 4*125=500). sigma_hat explicit=150 (inflated ~sqrt(4)*~38pd equiv, covers vol + uncertainty). z~0.95 (19/20), base_stock~500+1.645*150~747 >532 pipeline \u2192 order~215; cap~500/4 +1.645*150/sqrt(4)~125+123=248, so orders ~215 units to rebuild vs effective pipeline~86, targeting high service (profit>>holding) despite losses.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22), late spring; ladies skinny ankle denim jeans \u2013 no major calendar events (post-Easter 04-21), expect steady/moderate demand. Demands: early spikes P2-3 (179/136), regime shift down P4+ to ~51 avg (P4-7:67/35/52/41), P8 outlier 99, recent P9-10 drop to 32/23 (avg27.5). Full history mean=70.7, std~52.4, recent lower ~40/vol lower. On-hand=63 (covers ~2pd recent dmd), in-transit=661 but ghosts dominant: P1(41 ov8pd), P3(171 ov6), P4(234 ov5) lost per pattern, P10(215) pending ~LT2. Reliable future supply low; backend subtracts full pipe=724 unaware of losses. Set L=explicit 8 to inflate base_stock~(1+8)*70.7 +1.645*sqrt(9)*52.4 ~639+258=897 >724+cap~157, yielding order~157 (max cap) to rebuild. Default mu_hat/sigma_hat leverage full high mean/vol for inflation while respecting q=0.95 high service.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29): Late spring, ladies ankle denim jeans; steady seasonal demand expected, no major events. Recent demands P9-11:32,23,24 (avg 26.3, low vol), confirming further downward shift post-P8 outlier. Pipeline: on-hand 39 + in-transit 661 (includes likely lost P1:41 ov9p, P3:171 ov7p, P4:234 ov6p; P10:215 expected if LT=2). Observed LTs (3 arrivals): 2(P2->P4),1(P5->P6),2(P8->P10); recent avg~1.67. Use recent_N=3 for L (recent LTs), mu_hat/sigma_hat (new low-demand regime length=3, N=3); lowers base_stock to reflect subdued demand/vol, offsets bloated pipeline from losses \u2192 low/0 order-upto, balances high service (q=0.95) vs holding while 39 on-hand covers ~1.5 periods low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward at Period 9 (2019/4/8): avg decreased from 58.8 (P4-8:67,35,52,41,99) to 26.3 (-55%) sustained over 3 periods (P9-11:32,23,24); Lost shipments pattern sustained: P1(41u),P3(171u),P4(234u) overdue 9/7/6 periods past LT=2 with no arrivals.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6): Early May, no major retail events for ladies denim jeans (skinny ankle style); recent demand regime low and sustained P9-12: 32,23,24,22 (mean=25.25, std~4.6), continuing downward shift from prior carry-over. On-hand=17 < expected ~25 demand, risks stockout. Pipeline intransit=661 (P1:41 overdue ~12p past LT2, P3:171 ~10p, P4:234 ~9p confirmed lost pattern; P10:215 overdue past promised LT2 as no P12 arrival). Effective reliable inventory ~17 only (assume P10 lost per sustained pattern). Backend subtracts full bloated pipeline=678, would order 0 with normal params. Bridge gap by explicit mu_hat=690 (~effective 3*25=75 + ~615 ghost inflate moderated for cap), sigma_hat=10 (~recent vol sqrt(3)*4.6~8 inflated slightly); base_stock~690+1.65*10~706.5, orders ~28 (min(28, cap~ mu_hat/(1+L_calc~2.67)~260)). L=calculate (avg 3 observed LTs:2(P2-P4),1(P5-P6),2(P8-P10)=1.67). Ensures order ~1 period demand to cover stockout risk without excess (high profit/low holding favors service).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13): Mid-May, off-peak for ladies denim jeans (skinny ankle style), demand regime low post downward shift at P9 (P9-13 demands:32,23,24,22,8 avg21.8, std~7.9); P13=8 continues suppression. On-hand=9 low; in-transit=690 overstates effective pipeline (confirmed lost: P1=41 overdue~12p, P3=171~11p, P4=234~10p past LT2; P10=215 overdue 2p no P12/P13 arrival; only P13=29 pending LT~2). Inventory position~699 but effective~38. Observed LTs (arrivals P4=2p,P6=1p,P10=2p avg1.67) reliable but low arrival rate. To bridge lost shipments inflating pipeline, set L explicit=10 (high to scale default mu_hat=(11)*mean_all~644, sigma_hat=sqrt(11)*std_all~160 \u2192 base_stock~907 >>699+cap), triggers order=historical cap~58+1.645*48~138 units for buffer vs low demand~20/p while high z*=1.645 ensures service; cap leverages historical peaks/vol for safety stock without over-reliance on recent low std.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20): Late spring, low seasonal demand expected for denim jeans as summer approaches; recent demands P9-14 avg ~22 (32,23,24,22,8,23), confirming sustained low regime but with P13=8 dip. On-hand=0, in-transit=763 bloated by confirmed lost shipments P1(41),P3(171),P4(234 total 446u overdue 12+/7+/5+ periods) + P10(215u overdue 3 periods, expected arrive P12 but no arrivals P12-14) + recent P13(29),P14(73). Effective reliable pipeline low (~763-661 lost?=102?), recent stockouts (P14 sold 9/23). Backend subtracts full pipeline unaware of losses, so inflate L explicit=9 to make (1+9)*historical_mean=10*56=560, sigma_hat~sqrt(10)*52\u2248164, z*sigma\u2248269, base_stock\u2248829 >763, prompting order ~66 (capped near ~56 + 269/sqrt(10)\u2248136). Defaults for mu_hat/sigma_hat leverage full-history high mean(56)/volatility to buffer service (q=0.95) vs holding, covering potential spikes while addressing losses/delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further downward shift at Period 12: avg decreased from 26.3 (P9-11:32,23,24) to 17.7 (-33%) sustained over P12-14 (22,8,23); Lost shipments pattern sustained: P10 order (215u) overdue 3 periods past LT=2 (no arrival in P12-14 concludes)

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

In-transit=763 overstated due to sustained lost shipments (P1:41 overdue 13+ periods, P3:171 ov12+, P4:234 ov11+, P10:215 ov4+, P13:29 ov2 past LT=2 confirmed no P15 arrival; ~690u likely lost). Pipeline illusion suppresses orders; inflate mu_hat explicit=1150 (~3 periods inflated demand) with L=2 sets base_stock ~1150 + z*sigma >763 + cap (~380), yielding order ~380u to replenish losses (min(base-pipe~387, cap~383)) without excessive cap via low recent sigma.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03, early summer Monday); ladies skinny ankle denim jeans - fashion item with volatile demand, potential summer relevance unclear but historical spikes (max 179 P2). Recent demands P13-16: 8,23,18,93 (avg 35.5, std~34 per period) with P16 stockout of 93 (~$1770 lost profit). On-hand=0; in-transit=1158 includes sustained lost shipments (~661u overdue: P1=41/16+ overdue, P3=171/14+, P4=234/13+, P10=215/7+, P13=29/4+, P14=73/3+) + recent P16=395 (expected P18). Observed LTs only from arrivals: P4(L=2 from P2), P6(L=1 from P5), P10(L=2 from P8) - avg~1.67, no new LT shift. Downward regime P12-15 (~18 avg) broken by P16 spike but not sustained (1 period). To address ghost pipeline overstatement (lost don't serve demand but subtract from order qty), use default L=2 but explicit mu_hat=1100 (~367/wk equiv, above all-time avg56 but covers spikes/loss risk), sigma_hat=300 (elev > sqrt(3)*61~106 default, buffers volatility + unreliable pipeline); yields base_stock~1100+1.645*300=1593 >1158 (order~435), cap~1100/3 +1.645*300/sqrt(3)~355+285=640 >435 ok.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10, early summer, ladies skinny ankle denim jeans; Father's Day ~June 16 may mildly boost apparel). Recent demand: P13-17 (8,23,18,93,69) mean 42.2, up from prior low ~17.7 (P12-15), with spike P16=93/P17=69 suggesting possible upward shift but only 2 periods (not sustained 3+). High on-hand=326 covers ~5 periods at recent mean; in-transit=1199 inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P1=41 overdue~17p, P3=171/~15p, P4=234/~14p, P10=215/~8p, plus P13=29 overdue 3p/P14=73 overdue 2p) totaling ~763 ghosts\u2014effective pipeline lower ~436 incoming soon. Observed LTs (arrivals only): P4(LT2 P2), P6(LT1 P5), P10(LT2 P8), P17(LT1 P16) avg=1.5; 'calculate' uses this avg for realistic L~(1+L=2.5) buffering variability/loss risk without overstocking ghosts. mu_hat recent_5 (N=5=max(3,min(~5 recent volatile regime,20))) partially weights uptick (42.2*2.5~105 base) vs prior low for conservative order amid high inv. sigma_hat recent_5 captures vol (std~37*sqrt(2.5)~58) for z*~1.64 (q=19/20=0.95). Lowers base_stock vs default (all-demand mean~57*(3)=171) to minimize holding on bloated pipeline while covering ~2-3p demand (~120).

Recent changepoint at P16: demand avg 71.3 (P16-18:93,69,52) vs prior regime 17.8 (P12-15:22,8,23,18; +300%), sustained 3 periods, N=3 used for forecast (mean=71.3, sample std=20.6). Pipeline: on-hand 274 + in-transit 1199=1473 reported; but sustained lost shipments ~763u (P1:41 overdue~16p, P3:171/~14p, P4:234/~13p, P10:215/~7p, P13:29 overdue~4p, P14:73 overdue~3p); reliable pending ~436u (P17, LT>=2 confirmed no P18 arrival). True IP~710 >> true base~3*71.3 +1.645*sqrt(3)*20.6 ~214+59=273 (order 0 correct). To bridge lost gap permanently bloating pipeline: explicit inflate mu_hat by lost qty for target base_stock=lost+true_base~763+273=1036 (orders true needed later despite ghosts). mu_hat=977=3*71.3+763; sigma_hat=36~sqrt(3)*20.6; expected base=977+1.645*36~977+59=1036. L=2 explicit for cap~977/3 +1.645*36/sqrt(3)~326+34=360 (covers future needs). Balances high service (q=0.95) vs holding by compensating phantom inventory precisely.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 16 (2019-05-27): avg increased from 17.8 (P12-15:22,8,23,18) to 71.3 (+300%) sustained over 3 periods (P16-18:93,69,52)

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24, late June summer period for ladies skinny ankle denim jeans; steady summer demand expected, no immediate holidays). Recent demand regime shift upward sustained P16-19: demands 93,69,52,68 (mean=70.5, std\u224816.9); regime length=4 >=3, evidence confirms +300% from prior avg~17.8. On-hand=206 (covers ~3 weeks at 70/wk), in-transit=1199 overstated due to sustained lost/delayed shipments (e.g., P1:41 overdue ~17p, P3:171/~16p, P4:234/~15p, P10:215/~8p, P13:29/~5p, P14:73/~4p, P17:436 overdue 1p past LT=2 no arr in P19 conclude). No new arrivals expected immediately. L=explicit 3 to bridge losses/delays (effective LT longer than observed 1-2 on arrived orders; avg observed LT=1.5 but ignores infinities from losses). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 for current high-demand regime (backend: mu=(1+3)*70.5=282, sigma=sqrt(4)*16.9\u224833.8). Higher L/mu inflate base_stock to compensate ghost pipeline (backend subtracts unreliable in-transit), ensuring coverage for 4p demand (~282) at q=19/20=0.95 high service vs holding; current high on-hand limits orders via base_stock-pipeline<0 likely, cap irrelevant; maximizes R by avoiding stockouts on high-profit item.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments pattern sustained: P17 order (436u) overdue past LT=2 (expected arr P19, none in P19 conclude); total overdue units >>1000 with no resolution.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01, early summer): Demand sustained high in recent regime (changepoint P16, sustained 5 periods P16-20:93,69,52,68,99; avg mu_p=76.2, sigma_p~19.4). On-hand=107 covers ~1 period demand; in-transit=1199 bloated by chronic lost shipments (e.g., P1=41 overdue 20p, P3=171 ov19p, P4=234 ov17p, P10=215 ov11p, P17=436 ov4p, others; total lost>>1000u, pattern sustained per carry-over). Backend unaware of losses sees pipeline~1306, risks order=0. Set explicit L=15 (to compensate effective infinite LT from losses: base~(1+15)*76.2 +1.64*sqrt(16)*19.4 ~1218+128=1346>1306, triggers order); mu_hat recent_5 (regime N=5, scales to (16)*76.2~1218); sigma_hat recent_5 (scales to sqrt(16)*19.4~78). Ensures order up to cap~76+1.64*19.4~108 matching recent demand, replenishing true pipeline while balancing high profit(19)/holding(1) service.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08), summer denim trousers post-July 4 holiday (P21 demand 132 spike). Recent demand regime upward shift at P19 sustained 3 periods: P19-21 avg 99.7 (68,99,132) vs prior P16-18 71.3 (+40%). Pipeline 1240u but ~1200u lost/overdue (P1:41 ov~20p, P3:171 ov~7p, P4:234 ov~6p, P10:215 ov~4p, P13:29 ov~3p, P14:73 ov~3p, P17:436 ov~5p), effective pipeline ~40u (P21:41). On-hand 0. Use default L=2 (promised/observed avg~1.5-2). mu_hat recent_N=3 captures new high-demand regime (backend: ~3*99.7=299). sigma_hat explicit=800 inflates for pipeline uncertainty/losses (z*sigma~1316, base~299+1316=1615>1240, order~375 up to cap~860). Ensures backend orders aggressively to rebuild inventory (covers ~4p demand@100 minus effective pipeline), leveraging high q~0.95 for profit despite low holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 19 (2019-06-17): avg increased from 71.3 (P16-18:93,69,52) to 99.7 (+40%) sustained over 3 periods (P19-21:68,99,132)

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15, mid-summer), ladies skinny ankle denim jeans; current high demand regime since P19 (avg 99 over P19-22: 68,99,132,97), P22 stockout (demand 97, ending OH=0). In-transit 1615 heavily inflated by sustained lost shipments (e.g., P1:41 overdue ~22p, P3:171/~20p, P4:234/~19p, P10:215/~13p, P13:29/~10p, P14:73/~9p, P17:436/~6p, others pending); effective reliable pipeline near 0. Observed LTs (4 arrives: P2@2, P5@1, P8@2, P16@1, avg=1.5). Use L=calculate (avg=1.5). To force base_stock >>1615 despite inflated pipeline (backend subtracts all in-transit), explicit mu_hat=1800 (~720/period inflated for lost compensation + buffer 6 periods@100), sigma_hat=250 (inflated for regime/LT volatility + lost uncertainty); yields base_stock~1800+1.645*250~2210, order~595 (after -1615), cap~980 allows it. High q=0.95 favors overstock vs lost sales ($19>>$1 holding). Covers ~6 future periods demand post-order.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22, mid-summer): Ladies skinny ankle denim jeans likely in sustained high summer demand regime (carry-over upward shifts P16/P19/P22, confirmed by P19-23 demands:68,99,132,97,126 avg=104.4, vs prior ~18-71). On-hand=290 covers ~2-3 periods demand; in-transit=1796 includes many overdue/lost (e.g., P1/3/4/10/13/14/17 orders no conclude past LT=2, pattern sustained per carry-over). Observed LTs (6 total: P2@2,P5@1,P8@2,P16@1,P21@2,P22@1 avg=1.5) mixed 1-2, no new shift. Recent regime length=5 (P19-23 high demand changepoint P19), so recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to forecast high mean/vol across (1+L)~2.5 periods (~260 demand). L=calculate uses avg observed LT=1.5 (backend ignores lost). High recent mu_hat elevates base_stock/q=0.95 service despite unreliable pipeline, minimizing stockouts (profit$19>>holding$1); recent sigma_hat matches vol. No need explicit as methods capture.

Carry-over insight: Demand high summer regime extended: avg 104.4 sustained P19-23 (68,99,132,97,126 +40% vs prior 71.3 P16-18); LT alternating 1-2 sustained (last 6 obs exactly 2,1,2,1,2,1 avg1.5)

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent LT pattern sustained alternating 1-2 over last 6 observations (P2:2, P5:1, P8:2, P16:1, P21:2, P22:1 avg1.5). High pipeline 1796+216=2012 includes sustained lost shipments (e.g., P17:436 overdue ~7 periods, older P1/3/4/10), but recent P21/P22 arrived on schedule. Use recent_N N=6 for L/mu_hat/sigma_hat to target current short LT and high-demand regime: mu_hat~(1+1.5)*99.3~249, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.5)*26.1~41; supports high service q=19/20=0.95 (z~1.645, base~249+68~317) vs holding, cap limits excess while compensating lost pipeline risk via elevated recent mean/vol.

On-hand 448 covers current, in-transit 2339 includes P27 order 1140 (expected LT~2, arrives during P29) + chronic lost (e.g., old P1/3/4 etc.). Observed LTs: 7 recent (P2->4:2, P5->6:1, P8->10:2, P16->17:1, P21->23:2, P22->23:1, P23->26:3; avg 1.71). L recent_7 reflects lower actual avg vs promised 2, preventing understock from LT optimism. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_10 captures high-demand regime (changepoint P19 sustained >10 periods, N=min(regime=10,20)=10), scaling (1+L)~2.7x recent mean/vol for base_stock to cover ~3 periods demand ~288 while high pipeline limits overorder via cap. Addresses lost via realistic LT/demand, balances service vs holding.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02): Early September, back-to-school season likely sustains demand for ladies denim jeans (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens). Recent demand P20-29 (99,132,97,126,74,90,94,79,102,80) avg 97.3, consistent with high summer regime extension (P19-23 avg104.4, P24-29 avg86.5 still elevated ~85-100). No new regime shift. On-hand 368 covers multiple periods (~4x recent demand), in-transit 2339 high but unreliable due to sustained lost/delayed shipments (e.g., P27 1140 overdue past LT=2, no arr in P29 conclude; historical losses P1/P3/P4 etc.). LT observations: recent 7 (3,2,1,1,2,1,2) avg~1.7, but LT=3 (P23->P26) and overdue suggest risks; use default L=2 (promised) for backend stability. mu_hat recent_10 (P20-29 avg97.3 x3=292) captures sustained high demand regime (post-P19 shift, length>10). sigma_hat recent_10 for matching volatility (~20). Parameters ensure high service (q=19/20=0.95) over 3 periods while high pipeline tempers new orders, minimizing hold cost on excess.

Carry-over insight: Demand high regime sustained into Sep (P24-29:74,90,94,79,102,80 avg86.5, -17% vs P19-23 104 but still +20% vs pre-P16); LT pattern update: avg1.7 sustained (last 7 obs:3,2,1,1,2,1,2), includes LT=3 confirming occasional drift

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09): Early September post-summer; high demand regime sustained into Sep (P24-29 avg86.5, P24-30 avg82.3), P30 demand=57 dip (-30%) but single period, not sustained 3+ for new changepoint. Product: ladies skinny ankle denim jeans, seasonal summer high extended but possible back-to-school stabilization. On-hand=1451 + in-transit=1199 (likely includes old lost + recent pipeline) provides 20+wks coverage at ~80/wk demand, high holding risk. Reconcile pipeline: recent arrivals confirm LT drift (P27 LT3 arr P30, P23 LT3 arr P26); no new overdues resolved. LT: recent 7 obs (3,3,2,1,1,2,1) avg~1.86 vs promised 2, use recent_N=7 to capture drift. mu_hat: recent_N=8 (P23-30:126,74,90,94,79,102,80,57 avg87.8) for sustained high regime. sigma_hat: recent_N=8 (std~25) for current volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16): Early fall transition for ladies skinny high-waist ankle denim jeans; post-summer demand drop evident P30=57/P31=37 (avg47) vs sustained high P24-29 avg86.5 (-45%), potential seasonal decline confirmed by 2 periods but not yet 3+. On-hand=1414 (covers ~38 periods at recent 37 or ~20 at 70); in-transit=1199 exactly lost shipments sum (P1:41+P3:171+P4:234+P10:215+P13:29+P14:73+P17:436, all overdue 10-30+ periods past LT=2, no concludes). Real pipeline=1414 high vs expected future demand ~70*16 periods=1120; no order needed, backend safe at overstated 2613. L recent_4 (last LT obs: P30/P27=3, P26/P23=3, P23/P21=2, P23/P22=1; avg2.25) accounts for recent LT drift vs promised 2. mu_hat recent_10 (P22-31 avg83.6, regime from P22 upward shift sustained 10 periods despite tail drop) for (1+L)~3.25*84~272. sigma_hat recent_10 (low vol~25) for safety ~1.6*sqrt(3.25)*25~82; base~354 <<1414 prevents overstocking, balances holding vs service amid drop.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23): Late September, post-summer seasonal demand drop for ladies denim ankle jeans confirmed; recent P30-32 demands 57,37,36 avg=43.3 (-50% vs P24-29 avg86.5), sustained 3 periods indicating new low-demand regime. High inventory: 1378 on-hand + 1199 in-transit (includes old lost shipments + recent pipeline); no stockouts, heavy holding costs ahead. LT observations: 8 total (2,1,2,1,2,1,3,3) avg~1.9; recent include LT=3 drift but avg stable near promised 2. Use 'calculate' for L to leverage avg observed LT~1.9 bridging drift; 'recent_N' N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat capturing downward changepoint at P30, lowers base_stock/mu to reduce overstock risk given massive pipeline (OR caps order anyway). Balances high service (low demand risk) vs holding by downweighting prior high regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward at Period 30 (2019-09-02): avg decreased from 86.5 (P24-29:74,90,94,79,102,80) to 43.3 (-50%) sustained over P30-32 (57,37,36)

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30), late Sep fall transition for ladies skinny ankle denim jeans; no immediate holidays, demand stable low post downward shift at P30 sustained 4 periods (P30-33 demands:57,37,36,40; avg=42.5, std\u22489.8 sample). On-hand=1338 + in-transit=1199 covers 60+ periods demand, prioritize low parameters to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) vs profit $19. Recent LT (last 6 observed arrivals for orders P8 LT2, P16 LT1, P21 LT2, P22 LT1, P23 LT3, P27 LT3; avg=2.0, sustained variable 1-3 pattern). L recent_N=6 reflects true avg LT~2 > promised in places. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=4 anchors low mean/vol regime (changepoint evidence: -50% vs P24-29 avg86.5, stable <50 4 periods), yields low base_stock=\u03bc\u0302+z\u03c3\u0302 so order\u22480 given pipeline >> (1+L)*42.5.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7), fall season post-summer peak for ladies denim jeans; demand in sustained low regime since P30 changepoint (avg ~41 over P30-34:57,37,36,40,34, -50% vs prior 86.5), confirmed by P33=40,P34=34; high OH=1304 + IT=1199 covers >>50 periods at current demand, minimizing holding costs. No overdue recent shipments (last order P27 arrived P30 LT=3). LT observations (chrono reverse):3(P27@P30),3(P23@P26),2(P21@P23),1(P22@P23),1(P16@P17),2(P8@P10),1(P5@P6),2(P2@P4); last 8 avg=1.875~promised 2. Use recent_N N=8 for L to capture sustained avg1.9 w/ occasional 3 drift. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=5 for low demand regime (mean~40.8, low std~8), yielding low base_stock to avoid overstock vs high historical default; balances high profit service vs holding by reflecting current low mu/sigma over ~2.9 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Jeans demand low post-summer peak, no calendar spikes imminent (Halloween minor for apparel). High on-hand=1268 + in-transit=1199 covers >>30 periods at 40/wk demand, minimizing holding costs ($1/u/period) key. Old lost shipments (e.g., P1/3/4 etc.) likely comprise much of in-transit, no recent arrivals (last P30: P27 LT=3). Observed LTs (8 total:2,1,2,1,2,1,3,3 avg1.875) varying 1-3; use 'calculate' for L to reflect avg~1.9 vs promised 2.

High on-hand=1244 covers 30+ periods at ~38/demand; in-transit=1199 likely includes historical lost/severely delayed shipments (early P1/P3/P4/P10 etc., total historically >>1000 overdue), but recent arrivals complete (no new losses). LT pattern sustained avg~1.9 (last 8 observed LTs:2,1,2,1,2,1,3,3 from P4/P6/P10/P17/P23x2/P26/P30); use recent_N=8 for L, recent_N=7 for mu/sigma to reflect low-demand/low-var regime and LT drift, ensuring base_stock targets ~38*(1+1.9)~72 with low sigma~10*sqrt(2.9)~17, z~1.64 for q=19/20=0.95 \u2192 order near 0 given massive pipeline/on-hand, minimizing holding costs.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): Late October, fall season for ladies skinny ankle denim jeans; post-summer high demand, current low demand regime since changepoint P30 (2019-09-02) sustained over 8 periods (P30-37 demands:57,37,36,40,34,36,24,35; avg=37.4, stable ~30-50 range, -50%+ vs summer peaks ~86-104). High inventory: on-hand=1209 covers ~35 periods at recent avg; in-transit=1199 likely includes historical lost shipments (e.g., early P1/P3/P4 etc. per carry-over) + no recent orders since P27. No new arrivals/overdues in P37. LT inference from 8 concluded arrivals (P2LT2,P5LT1,P8LT2,P16LT1,P21LT2,P22LT1,P23LT3,P27LT3): avg=1.875, occasional drift to 3. Use recent_N=8 (regime_length=8, min(8,20)=8>=3) for L/mu_hat/sigma_hat to match sustained low demand/volatility and LT avg~1.9; lowers base_stock vs default (avoids overordering on high historical mean), balances high q=19/20=0.95 service vs holding given excess pipeline (~2408 total inv covers 60+ periods). Anticipate potential holiday uptick (Thanksgiving/Black Friday ~4wks) but prioritize data-driven conservatism.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime extended P30-37: avg37.4 sustained 8 periods (57,37,36,40,34,36,24,35; stable post-P33 update); LT avg1.9 sustained last 8 obs (2,1,2,1,2,1,3,3) with occasional LT=3

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): Early November, post-Halloween/pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday; ladies denim jeans in sustained low demand regime (P30-38: demands 57,37,36,40,34,36,24,35,25; avg=36, std~9.5), no evidence of holiday uptick yet despite calendar proximity. Massive pipeline (OH=1184 + IT=1199=2383 covers ~66 periods at 36/unit). LT stable avg1.9 over last 8 observations (2,1,2,1,2,1,3,3), no new arrivals in P38. No overdue new shipments flagged. Use recent_N N=8 for L to capture recent avg~1.9 (vs promised 2); recent_N N=9 for mu_hat/ sigma_hat to anchor on stable low regime (mu_hat~(1+1.9)*36~140, low sigma), ensuring low base_stock, minimal ordering to cut holding costs on excess inventory while covering LT+1 demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11): Low demand regime sustained since changepoint P30 (2019-09-02), now 10 periods (P30-39 demands:57,37,36,40,34,36,24,35,25,29 avg35.3, stable ~30-40/wk post-initial 57); no evidence of holiday spike yet (P36-39:24,35,25,29 despite approaching Black Friday 11/29, consistent with extended low regime per carry-over P38). High inventory position: OH=1155 + IT=1199=2354 (~67 periods at 35/wk), IT likely stalled lost shipments (no arrivals P31-39, pattern sustained). LT pattern sustained avg1.9 (all 8 obs: P4:2,P6:1,P10:2,P17:1,P23:2/P23:1,P26:3,P30:3; recent emphasize occasional LT=3). Set L recent_8 (avg~1.9) to reflect recent drifts vs promised 2; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_10 (low regime length=10, N=max(min(10,20),3)=10) to lower base_stock=\u03bc\u0302+z\u03c3\u0302, reduce overstock risk/order qty=0 given high pipeline/holding costs, balance service (cover 1+L~3 periods ~105 demand) vs low demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18), approaching Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29), but no demand spike observed; low regime sustained P30-40 (11 periods: demands 57,37,36,40,34,36,24,35,25,29,24 avg34.3, stable ~25-40 recently). High inventory: on-hand 1131 + in-transit 1199 (includes historical lost shipments like early P1/P3/P4 unresolved). LT pattern sustained avg1.9 over last 8 observed arrivals (2,1,2,1,2,1,3,3). Use recent_N N=8 for L to reflect shorter actual LT vs promised 2, reducing base stock. recent_N N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat matches low regime length, forecasting low demand over (1+L)~2.9 periods (~100 total), balancing high q=0.95 service vs holding costs with excess stock; OR will likely order 0.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25): Approaching Black Friday (Nov 29) and holiday season; ladies denim jeans may see demand spike similar to past peaks (e.g., 179,132), but no evidence yet\u2014recent P38-41 demands 25,29,24,31 avg 27.25, confirming sustained low regime from P30 (12 periods, avg~34, std~9). On-hand 1100 + in-transit 1199 (mostly lost overdue shipments per carry-over, e.g., P1/3/4/10/13/14 totaling ~763u+) provides ~70 periods coverage at recent demand rates; ample buffer vs holding cost. No recent arrivals (last P30 LT=3), lost pattern sustained but no new LT obs. Use recent_N N=12 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to track low regime (changepoint P30 downward sustained 12p, N=min(12,20)=12); recent_N N=8 for L (last 8 LT obs:2,1,2,1,2,1,3,3 avg1.875). Params ensure conservative base_stock ~100 +1.6*~15*sqrt(2.875)~ ~140, order=0 (base <<2299 pipeline), balancing low holding vs high service; lost gap bridged by high current inv, few periods left (/47).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): Early December, approaching Christmas peak (Dec 25 ~P46); ladies denim jeans likely to see holiday demand uptick for gifts/winter wear, but recent demand stable low regime P30-42 (13 periods: demands 57,37,36,40,34,36,24,35,25,29,24,31,62; avg36.2) with P42=62 (+72%, possible Thanksgiving/Black Friday precursor 11/25). No sustained shift yet (1 period <3). On-hand 1038 + in-transit 1199 = ~2237 covers >60 periods at 36/wk; no arrivals since P30 (LT=3 from P27), in-transit likely recent orders (P31+ ordered=0s visible) + old lost (P1/3/4 etc overdue 40+ periods). LT sustained avg1.9 (last 8 obs:2,1,2,1,3,3,? per carry-over P38). High pipeline/on-hand suppresses orders. Set L recent_8 for avg~1.9< promised2, bridging backend. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_13 for low regime evidence (stable avg36, low vol~11 std), (1+L)~3 periods demand ~108 mu, low base-stock target minimizes holding on excess stock while covering; high q=19/20=0.95 ensures service if spike materializes.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16), pre-Christmas (Dec 25), ladies denim ankle jeans; potential holiday spike but recent demands low & declining (P41-44:31,62,24,15 avg33, P42=62 pre-Thanksgiving not sustained). Low regime sustained since P30 (Sep 2, 15 periods: demands avg~30.5, stable post-P33 shift). High pipeline (999 on-hand +1199 in-transit=2198) covers 50+ periods at avg30 demand; no recent orders (last P27 arr P30 LT3), no overdue new shipments. LT pattern stable avg1.9 (last 8 obs). Use recent_N N=15 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=15<20) to set low mu~91, sigma~sqrt(3)*~15 for (L+1=~3) low demand forecast; recent_N N=8 for L~1.9.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): Pre-Christmas week for ladies skinny ankle denim jeans; potential holiday spike but no evidence\u2014recent P42-45 demands 62/24/15/21 (avg 30.5, P44-45 low at 15/21 confirms no uptick yet). Low demand regime from P30 sustained 16 periods (P30-45 avg 33.1, std~12.8). High inventory (on-hand 978 + in-transit 1199 = 2177) vs expected ~110 over L+1 periods. Reconciled pipeline includes historical lost shipments (e.g., P1/3/4 overdue indefinitely). No new arrivals since P30 (LT=3 for P27 order); LT pattern sustained avg1.9. Set L recent_8 (last 8 obs: 2,1,2,1,2,1,3,3 avg1.875) to match observed drift/occasional 3. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_16 to anchor on sustained low regime (mean33.1*~2.9~96, sigma~12.8*sqrt2.9~22; z~1.64 yields base_stock~140 << pipeline, order=0, balances low holding vs service for profit=19/h=1).

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime extended P30-45: avg33.1 sustained 16 periods (57,37,36,40,34,36,24,35,25,29,24,31,62,24,15,21; stable ~30s with P42=62 outlier -12% deviation); no pre-Christmas spike evident (P44-45:15,21 low)

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30), post-Christmas period for ladies skinny ankle denim jeans; expect continued low demand as no holiday spike observed (P46=11 low, aligning with non-seasonal product). High on-hand=967 covers ~60+ periods at recent ~16/demand; in-transit=1199 likely permanent lost shipments (e.g., P10:215 overdue ~35 periods, P14:73 overdue ~31, P17:436 overdue ~28 past LT=2). No recent orders, no imminent arrivals. Confirmed downward changepoint at P44: demand avg 15.7 (P44-46:15,21,11) vs prior 35 (P30-43) (-55%), sustained 3 periods. Use L recent_8 (avg1.9 from last 8 obs:2,1,2,1,2,1,3,3) to reflect recent LT stability/drift. mu_hat recent_3 (mean15.7*(1+L)~47) and sigma_hat recent_3 (low std~4.1 *sqrt(1+L)~7) yield low base_stock ~47 + 1.6*7 ~64 << pipeline 2166, ensuring order~0 to avoid adding to holding costs while covering low demand over L+1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward at Period 44 (2019-12-09): avg decreased from 35 (P30-43) to 15.7 (-55%) sustained over 3 periods (P44-46:15,21,11)
