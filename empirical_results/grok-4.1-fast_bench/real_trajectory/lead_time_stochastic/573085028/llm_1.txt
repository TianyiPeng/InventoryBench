Major retail event: Christmas demand surge for apparel/gifts/clothing; expect sharp spikes in women's jeans as seasonal/holiday wardrobe upgrades. Matches historical surges (BTS Aug ~250avg, fall Oct ~224avg). (b) Demand regime: Holiday peak emerging - P43=235, P44=370 (avg 302.5, +320% vs Nov lull P39-41 avg72); building on Dec uptick, prior regimes (fall surge P35-37 avg224, post-BTS decline P30-32/32-34 avg~120/96). Forecast P45 ~380-450 (escalating to Christmas week peak), P46 peak ~450+, P47 post-holiday ~250 decline.

No new LT shift; discount pipeline ~30-50% for losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=285 (low vs ~400 exp P45 demand, risk ~100+ stockout if low arrivals); in-transit=2066 (huge, includes P42=300/P43=300 + prior pending; exp P45 arr ~300-600 if LT=3/2 succeed, but loss risk high \u2192 effective ~200-400). Post-P45: ample if arrivals materialize, but endgame (3pd left) holding risk on excess. (e) Final order logic: Order 350 to buffer P45-47 holiday peaks (~400/450/250 total ~1100) net low on-hand + uncertain arrivals/losses; prioritizes service ($4 profit/lost sale) over holding ($1/pd, max 2-3pd exposure); conservative vs pipeline glut but losses justify. Avoids 0 (stockout risk) or excess (>400 adds end-hold penalty).",
