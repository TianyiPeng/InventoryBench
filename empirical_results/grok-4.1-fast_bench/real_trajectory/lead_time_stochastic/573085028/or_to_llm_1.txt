{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised L=2, but historical variability (LT=1,2,3 observed recently, e.g., P45 arrive from P42 LT=3; many losses after 2+ periods past due per carry-over). No new concludes for recent orders yet (P44 order 300 expected P46 LT=2; P45 350 possible LT=1 P46 or LT=2 P47). In-transit 1572 includes historical lost (e.g., prior ~1000s lost per carry-over) but also recent viable pipeline (P44 300 + P45 350 + older undelivered). Effective pipeline likely covers 5-10 periods even with 50% loss rate. Inventory analysis: OH=7 very low (risk stockout P46 pre-arrivals), but arrivals add before demand; huge pipeline buffers post-P46. Demand analysis: Holiday pre-Christmas spike sustained P43-45: 235/370/293 (avg 299, +340% vs P39-42 low avg68); 2019-12-23 (Mon pre-Xmas Wed) expects peak ~300-400 for women's jeans (gift/party wear). Post-P46 (P47 ~12/30) likely sharp drop. Historical early-year low (e.g., Jan-Feb ~60s). OR rec=0: sensible as base-stock satisfied (pipeline >> mu_hat + safety for L=2, recent high demand partially reflected but historical bias low); cap not binding. Strategy: Follow OR 0 - no order needed; pipeline covers peak + post-holiday (even conservative effective ~800+ units incoming soon > 3 periods x 300=900); avoid excess holding into demand drop; monitor P46 arrivals for LT/loss confirmation. Covers (L+1)=3 periods outlook.",

Recent demand: holiday spike P43-45 avg~299, P46=162 (-46% drop), signaling post-holiday decline aligned with calendar (Christmas rush over, New Year's low for women's everyday jeans). Lead-time inferred from recent concludes: mix of LT=1,2,3 (e.g. P45 arrive P42 LT=3, P43 arrive P41 LT=2); promised=2, but losses common (carry-over lists many e.g. P38, P42 lost). OR recommends 0 using promised LT=2 and full-history demand (diluted by early lows); valid as pipeline covers 10+ periods even at 150 demand (1572/150~10pd), far exceeds (L+1)=3 periods need.
