Late July 2019 (P25, 7/29) is peak summer; fashion accessories like casual belts see high demand in warm weather for outfits. Approaching back-to-school (Aug) may sustain/boost. Matches recent data shift to high summer demand; early-year (Jan-Feb) highs possibly winter fashion, now summer regime. (b) Demand regime: High summer sustained P19-P24 (6/17-7/22): demands 88,50,127,113,38,93 (avg 84.8, median 90.5; P23=38 likely outlier e.g. weather). +280% vs spring P10-18 avg~22. Expect ~90/period continuing into late summer. (c) Lead time: Variability 1-2 periods sustained (e.g. P21 LT=2 arr P23, P22 LT=1 arr P23, P23 150 likely LT=2 arr P25 since no P24 arr). No new losses (recent P20-P22 all confirmed); P24 arr=0 consistent with LT=2 for P23. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 69 (risky for ~90 demand but arrivals resolve before demand). In-transit 450 covers ~5 periods (450/90); likely includes P23:150 (P25) + others (state aggregate high despite tracking; ample coverage). Total on-hand + pipeline >> near-term needs. (e) Order logic: Strong pipeline minimizes stockout risk; on-hand + P25 arrivals likely cover P25 demand. Hedge potential LT drift/demand peak (recent 127 max) + future periods with modest order for P27 arrival. Balance holding cost vs service: order 100.",

  "rationale": "(a) Product: Benny hip belt (women's narrow imitation leather belt accessory). Fashion accessory relevant for fall/winter outfits but not core holiday gift; recent Dec data shows low demand despite Christmas proximity (P43-45:12/10/19). Calendar: 2019-12-23 (Mon pre-Christmas Eve) typically peaks retail/gifts, but this SKU persisted low 'despite holidays' per carry-over (no spike observed P43-45 early-mid Dec). (b) Demand regime: Post-Halloween low sustained P38-45 (8 periods:76,42,38,28,39,12,10,19 avg~33, -60% vs fall high 104); downtrend pre-Christmas persists (low single digits to teens), no evidence of holiday spike for this accessory; forecast P46 ~25-40 (conservative continuation). (c) Lead time: Variability 1-3 periods sustained (recent: P42 ord arr P45 LT3, P40 LT3, P39 LT2); lost shipments pattern (~600 total, incl P38:150 overdue/confirmed lost); no new overdues (recent orders P42+ arrived or none placed P43-45); assume LT=2-3 for planning, order conservatively due to losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=386 (covers 10+ periods at ~30/demand), in-transit=600 (likely 3-4 shipments arriving LT1-3, ample pipeline); total visible ~986 vs forecast 30*4=120 next periods >> coverage; high holding risk. (e) Final order logic: No order needed (zero stockouts recently, excess inv eats holding $1/unit/period); prioritize drawing down stock vs risking more pipeline amid unreliable supplier/holiday uncertainty; covers LT+1=3-4 periods demand easily.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-Halloween low regime further sustained pre-Christmas P38-45 avg33 (8 periods, demands incl 12/10/19 downtrend persists despite Dec holidays, -60% vs fall high); prior regime extended with added evidence.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) World/product: Benny hip belt (women's narrow imitation leather belt accessory). Date 2019/12/30 (Mon, New Year's Eve week). Post-Christmas/New Year period typically low demand for fashion accessories after holiday peak; no major spikes expected (historical Jan demand avg~35 but recent Dec low overrides). (b) Demand regime: Post-Halloween low regime sustained P38-46 (9 periods, avg~30 declining to recent P43-46 avg14:12/10/19/14), -60% vs prior fall high; downtrend persists post-Christmas despite holidays, forecast ~15/period short-term. (c) Lead-time/missing: Variability 1-3 periods confirmed (recent: P42 LT3 P45, P40 LT3 P43, P39 LT2 P41); no new lost shipments (P46 arrived=0 as expected, no orders due LT1-3 from P43-45 all 0); sustained lost pattern ~600 units (hanging in-transit, e.g. P38 confirmed lost). (d) Inv&pipeline: On-hand 372 (P46 end); in-transit 600 (likely mostly lost/irredeemable); real pipeline thin/zero near-term (no recent orders P43-46=0); total position covers 20-25+ low-demand periods. (e) Order logic: High on-hand buffers low forecast demand + LT variability/safety (372 >> 15*4=60 cover); avoid adding to lost/holding risk (holding $372/period vs profit $60/15 sold); order 0 preserves R_t.",
