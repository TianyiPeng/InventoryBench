Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), near Valentine's Day (02-14) - women's lingerie product may see demand spike, but historical demands declining (83,59,64,50,36; mean=58.4, std=17.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no prior orders or conclude messages for lead time inference. Use defaults: L=promised 2; mu_hat=(1+2)*58.4\u2248175; sigma_hat=\u221a3*17.4\u224830. Supports high service level (q=4/5=0.8) to capture sales while minimizing hold costs, covering 3 periods demand proactively for potential holiday bump.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18), women's thong underwear post-Valentine's (Feb 14). P1 demand=32 continues downward trend from historical (most recent:36 on 02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=87 (P1 order, no overdue as LT=2 expects arrival in P3). No lead time observations yet. Changepoint evidence: demand declining, historical first 3 avg 68.7 to last 3 avg 50 (-27%), validated by P1=32. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (backend: 3*50=150) and sigma_hat (lower vol) to target lower base stock ~mu + 0.84*sigma, avoiding excess holding on pipeline+decline. L default (promised 2). Balances service (covers ~3 periods @~50/demand) vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand trend sustained over 6 periods: first 3 historical avg 68.7 to last 3 historical avg 50 (-27%), confirmed by P1 demand=32

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), late February, no major calendar events for women's lingerie/thongs (post-Valentine's low demand phase). Demand history shows sustained downward trend: historical first 3 avg 68.7, last 3 hist avg 50 (-27%), P1=32, P2=40 confirms low regime around 35-45 (recent 5: 64,50,36,32,40 avg 44.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=132 (P1 order=87 + P2=45), no arrivals yet as expected (P1 order arrives during P3 if LT=2, visible in P4). No confirmed lead times (no 'arrived>0' concludes yet), so default L=2. Use recent_5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect low demand regime (changeloint after hist D3=64, regime length ~5 periods, N=5>=3). Parameters target base_stock ~44.4*(1+2)=133 + z*sd*sqrt(3), balancing coverage for ~3 periods low demand (~120-135) vs holding, with pipeline covering near-term; reduces overstock risk vs default higher mean.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, no major calendar events impacting women's lingerie demand. Historical demands (5 samples avg 58.4) show downward trend (carry-over: first 3 avg 68.7 to last 3 avg 50, -27%), confirmed by game P1-3 demands 32,40,42 (recent avg 38, std ~5.3). Changelpoint post-2019-02-04 sustained lower regime (length 3+ game periods). On-hand 0, in-transit 152 (P1:87 overdue - expected P3 conclude but arrived=0; P2:45 expected P4; P3:20 expected P5). No confirmed arrivals/lead times (all conclude arrived=0, no 'lead_time was W' messages), so default L=2. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect lower mean/volatility regime (backend: mu~(1+2)*38=114, sigma~sqrt(3)*5.3~9.2). Lowers base_stock ~114 + 0.84*9~123 vs pipeline 152 \u2192 order~0, preventing overstock/holding costs amid high pipeline and potential P1 loss, while high q=0.8 maintains service if arrivals materialize.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), early March post-Valentine; lingerie demand in stable low regime ~38-42 (P1:32, P2:40, P3:42, P4:40; avg 38.5) confirming carry-over downward trend from historical highs (avg~58). On-hand=5 low, in-transit=107 (P1:87 overdue - expected LT2 arrive during P3/visible P3 conclude but arrived=0; P3:20 pending LT2 arrive P5). One confirmed LT=2 (P2->P4). No sustained LT shift yet (single confirmed, one delayed). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low-demand low-vol regime (std~3.8); L default=2 as backend promised. Params target ~115 mean demand over 3 periods, low sigma for tight base-stock; pipeline covers but flags P1 delay risk - OR balances high service vs holding with ample pipeline.

Carry-over insight: P1 shipment delayed beyond promised LT2 (expected visible P3 conclude, absent in P3/P4); monitor for pattern

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6, 2019/3/18: mid-March, no major retail events for women's lingerie (thong briefs); demand steady but downward trend sustained (carry-over: historical drop -27%, confirmed by game demands avg ~36 vs early ~69). On-hand=0, in-transit=117 (P1:87 overdue since expected P3 conclude, absent P3-P5 \u2192 likely lost inflating pipeline; P3:20 overdue past P5 expected; P5:10 recent). Recent demand regime last 5 periods (P1-P5): 32,40,42,40,24; mean=35.6, std\u22487.6; changepoint evidence: sustained low post-historical drop (regime length=5+). L default (promised 2, one confirmed LT=2 from P2\u2192P4; delays/losses noted but single confirmed avg=2). mu_hat recent_N=5 captures lower mean regime *(1+L). sigma_hat recent_N=5 for current vol. Params lower base_stock vs all-data to match demand drop, balance high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding amid inflated pipeline from losses (backend subtracts full in-transit \u2192 conservative order now, but regime params prevent over/under later).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed for P1: 87 units no arrival in expected P3 conclude or subsequent P4/P5 (3+ periods past); emerging delay pattern P3:20u absent expected P5 conclude

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), women's thong underwear, late March no major events, steady low demand regime. Recent demands P1-P6: 32,40,42,40,24,33 avg~35.2 (downward trend confirmed prior). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=108 (P1:87 overdue/lost, P3:20 overdue past LT3 visible P6 concl absent, P6:1 pending). Stockout risk immediate. Lead times observed: P2->P4 LT=2, P5->P6 LT=1; but P1&P3 lost/delays signal longer/variable LT. Set L explicit=3 to extend coverage for delays/lost (OR unaware), targeting ~4 periods demand. mu_hat recent_N=6 captures low mean~35.2 \u2192 (1+3)*35.2\u2248140. sigma_hat recent_N=6 low vol~6.8 \u2192 \u221a4*6.8\u224813.6. Higher L boosts base_stock despite high pipeline to preempt losses/stockouts; recent params prevent overstocking given profit=4/holding=1 high service but low demand.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern sustained: P1 (87u) and P3 (20u) no arrival after 4+ and 3+ periods past promised LT2 (absent P3-P6 and P5-P6 concludes respectively)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1): Women's microfibre thong briefs (lingerie). Early April, approaching Easter (4/21/2019) but no major demand spike expected for steady underwear category. OH=0, IT=153 inflated by confirmed lost P1(87u, absent P3-P7 concludes: 5+ periods past promised LT2 arrival), P3(20u, absent P5-P7: 4+ past); effective IT ~46u from P6(1u, exp P8 if LT2), P7(45u exp P9). Recent demand P1-7: 32/40/42/40/24/33/38 avg=35.6 (-48% vs hist avg~58), std~5.9; downward regime changepoint sustained 7 periods (carry-over confirmed trend). No new arrivals P7 conclude.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8, early April; Easter on 4/21 ~2 periods away - anticipate potential uptick in women's lingerie/underwear demand due to spring renewal). Recent demands P6-P8: 33/38/44 (avg 38.3, +7% vs P1-P5 avg 35.6, rising +15%/+16% period-over-period). On-hand 2 (low), in-transit 144 overstated by ~107 lost (P1:87, P3:20 confirmed absent 6+/4+ periods past LT2). Effective pipeline ~37 (P8 order). Observed LTs (arrived only): P2:2, P5:1, P6:2, P7:1 (avg 1.5, recent mixed 1-2); losses indicate risk. Set L='default' (promised 2, stable for arrived). mu_hat='explicit' value=180 ((1+2)*45, explicit forecast uplifts recent 38+~18% for Easter seasonality + loss compensation to induce base_stock > overstated pipeline). sigma_hat='explicit' value=25 (elevated for demand vol + LT/loss uncertainty; >sqrt(3)*recent std~9). Expected base_stock~180+0.84*25~201, order~55 (covers ~1.5 periods demand, starts recovery vs stockouts; high service q=0.8 prioritizes profit over holding).

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick regime at P6: avg 38.3 over 3 periods (+7% vs prior P1-P5 35.6, +15-16% consecutive increases); sustained into Easter (4/21)

Period 10 (2019/4/15), approaching Easter (4/21, likely P11), women's thong underwear with sustained demand uptick P6-P9: 33\u219238\u219244\u219249 (consecutive ~13% growth, mean 41 vs P1-P5 mean 35.6 +15%). Forecast escalation pre-Easter peak ~55(P10)+65(P11)+75(P12)=195, buffer to 225 equiv pd75. Pipeline: on-hand 0, in-transit 200 includes confirmed lost P1(87u absent P3-P9, 7+pd past LT2)+P3(20u absent P5-P9, 5+pd past)=107u lost; reliable ~93u (P8:37u expect P10 LT2 since absent P9; P9:56u LT1/2 P10/P11). Backend blind to losses, sees pipeline 200>> base_stock default~ (3*45)=135, underorders risking stockouts in peak. Override with explicit mu_hat=225 (3pd peak cover), sigma_hat=40 (boosted buffer ~pd std23 equiv recent std7 + historical~17 + growth vol); L default=2 conservative amid observed LTs 1.5 avg (1,1,2,2). Ensures base_stock~225+0.84*40\u2248259>200 triggers ~58u order (under cap~113), high service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Easter demand acceleration: P6-P9 mean 41 (+15% vs P1-P5 35.6), consecutive ~13% increases sustained 4 periods (33\u219249 total +48%)

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22), post-Easter Monday. Pre-Easter demand acceleration sustained P6-P10: demands 33,38,44,49,53 (mean 43.4, +22% vs P1-P5 mean 35.6; consecutive increases ~15-20%). Product: women's thong underwear (steady category, potential Easter gifting boost now passed; anticipate stabilization at ~45). On-hand=40 (from P10 ending), in-transit=166 (includes P10 order=59 pending + prior lost P1=87/P3=20 still undelivered after 8+/6+ periods, effective pipeline lower). Observed LTs: 6 arrivals (P4 LT2-P2, P6 LT1-P5, P8 LT2-P6/LT1-P7, P10 LT2-P8/LT1-P9) avg=1.5, alternating 2-1 pattern sustained. No new post-Easter demand evidence. L=recent_N N=6 (avg recent LT=1.5 < promised 2, lowers base_stock timing but accounts for faster arrivals). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 (regime_length=5 from P6 uptick changepoint, mean~43.4 \u2192 mu~(1+1.5)*43.4~117; low recent std ~7.9 \u2192 sigma~sqrt(2.5)*7.9~12.5). Higher mu from recent demand + q=0.8 boosts service level to cover losses/delays (OR unaware); cap limits overorder; balances profit vs holding on high pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29), post-Easter (4/21). Product: women's thong underwear; spring/Easter demand uptick sustained (lingerie relevant for holidays). Demands P6-P11: 33,38,44,49,53,60 (mean 46.2, +48% cumulative increase from P6=33); changepoint at P6 confirmed by carry-over (avg 38.3 P6-P9 +15% vs prior), extended by P10=53/P11=60 consecutive rises. On-hand=0; in-transit=166=107 lost (P1:87+P3:20, per carry-over) +59 (P10 order, LT1 ruled out by P11 arr=0, expected LT2 arr during P12 visible P13).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6), post-Easter, approaching Mother's Day (5/12) - expect sustained high demand for women's lingerie gifts. Recent demands P8-P12: 44,49,53,60,81 (mean 57.4, strong acceleration +48% from P8=44 to P12=81). On-hand=0, in-transit=166 (ghost: lost P1=87, P3=20, P10=59 confirmed overdue/absent P11 LT1 & P12 LT2). No reliable pipeline soon, P12 stockout lost 81 sales. Observed LTs avg 1.5 (mix 1-2), but sustained losses require inflating coverage. Set L explicit=3 (effective LT w/losses), mu_hat recent_N=5 (backend: 4*57.4=229.6), sigma_hat recent_N=5 (backend: sqrt4*~14.4=28.9). Base_stock~230+0.84*29~253 >166 pipeline \u2192 order~87 capped~81 (matches recent demand*1.3), balances lost sales vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern update: P10 (59u) confirmed lost (absent P11-P12 concludes, 2+ periods past LT2); total lost 166u in-transit; Post-Easter demand spike sustained P10-P12: 53,60,81 (avg 64.7, +70% vs P1-P9 avg 38)

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13) post-Mother's Day; women's thong underwear demand elevated recently (P7-13 avg 52.6 vs all-sample ~48.4), post-Easter spike (P10-12 avg64.7) with P13 dip to 43 but regime avg sustained up (+~8%). Pipeline 248 = confirmed lost 166u (P1:87, P3:20, P10:59) + P13:82 (due P15); sustained ~46% loss rate (194 arrived vs 360 ordered P1-10), no imminent arrivals, ghost pipeline suppresses OR orders. Observed LTs (6): three 1s/three 2s avg1.5 but losses imply unreliable/ longer effective LT. Set L explicit=5 to inflate (1+L)=6x recent mean ~316 >>248 for base_stock > pipeline. recent_N=7 (regime ~7 periods post-P6 uptick/changepoint per carry-over P9) for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures sustained higher mean/vol (std recent7 backend-computed ~15-20). OR q=4/5=0.8 yields z~0.84, safety~0.84*sqrt(6)*std~ sigma_hat*0.84; total base_stock ~313 + 50+ >>248 prompts refill order (capped reasonably), ensures service vs recent stockouts (P11-13) while holding cost managed by backend policy.

On-hand=0, pipeline=325 bloated by 166 confirmed lost (P1:87, P3:20, P10:59 remain in-transit indefinitely); real pending P13:82 (due P15 if LT=2), P14:77 (due P16). Recent stockouts P11-P14.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27, Memorial Day holiday - potential retail demand boost for summer lingerie/underwear). Recent stockouts (on-hand=0, P11-P15 sold limited by inv), pipeline=362 bloated by sustained lost shipments (~166u confirmed P1/P3/P10 + P13 82u overdue/absent P15 conclude for LT2). Demand regime post-Easter changepoint P10 sustained 6 periods P10-P15: mean=57.3 (+50% vs P1-P9=38), std=12.8 (high vol incl P12=81). To counter permanent pipeline bloat from losses, set L=explicit 7 for extended coverage (1+L=8, mu_hat~(8*57.3)=458, sigma_hat~sqrt(8)*12.8=36.3, base_stock~458+0.84*36=488>362), triggers order up to cap~57+1.65*12.8~80 despite high position, rebuilding effective inv (q=0.8 high service). recent_N=6 matches regime length (min(6,20)=6>3).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3): Early summer, women's thong underwear; steady demand expected, no major events. Recent demand P13-P16: 43,55,52,54 avg51 (+34% vs P1-P9 avg38); post-Easter high regime P10-P16 avg56.9 (+50%). Confirmed lost shipments: P1(87),P3(20),P10(59),P13(82),P14(77) total 325u ghost inventory bloating in-transit 441u (effective pipeline ~116u from P15:37+P16:79 pending). Ongoing stockouts (ending inv=0 P11-P16). No arrivals P15-P16 concludes confirm recent losses. To compensate ghost overstatement in pipeline (backend subtracts full 441u), inflate mu_hat explicitly by ghost amount: normal (1+2)*recent avg ~170 +325=495, set 500 for buffer. L default (promised 2, observed arrived LT avg1.5 close). Sigma recent_7 (P10-P16 std~11.9, sqrt3*11.9~20.6) for post-Easter volatility. Forces base_stock ~500 +0.84*21~517 >441, order ~76 (under cap~ mu_hat/3 +1.645*sigma/sqrt3 ~167+28~195), replenishing effective position while balancing holding via q=0.8 service.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern sustained: P13(82u) lost (absent expected P15 conclude), P14(77u) lost (absent P16 conclude); total confirmed lost 325u (+159u); Post-Easter high demand regime extended P10-P16 avg56.9 (+50% vs P1-P9 38), recent P13-P16 stabilized avg51 (+34%)

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10, early summer Monday); women's microfibre thong briefs (lingerie/underwear) likely sees steady/higher demand in warming weather. Post-Easter high demand regime sustained P10-P17 (8 periods, avg 63, +50-70% vs P1-P9 avg 38), peaks P12:81/P17:106 (+96% vs P13-P16 avg51), volatility high (std~20). Lost shipment pattern sustained (325u confirmed lost bloating in-transit 402u; actual reliable pipeline ~77u pending P17 only). On-hand 10 low vs expected demand ~60-100. Reconcile: no arrivals expected P18 (P17 LT1/2 would arrive P18/P19). To force OR backend ordering despite bloated pipeline, use default L=2 (promised/observed avg1.5), explicit mu_hat=480 (~160/period = recent 63 x2.5 adjustment for ~60% loss rate recent orders P10/13/14 lost vs P15/16 arrived), recent_N=8 sigma_hat for high-vol regime (P10-P17 std~20, sqrt(3)*20~35, z~0.84*35~29; base~480+29=509>412 pipeline, order~97 capped appropriately). Ensures high service level q=0.8 for profit max vs holding, replenishes true supply gap proactively.

On-hand=0, in-transit=500 bloated with confirmed lost ghosts (325u+ like P1=87,P3=20,P10=59,P13=82,P14=77); recent P17 ord=77, P18=98 expected P20 if LT2 but loss pattern sustained risks more ghosts. No P19 arrivals visible yet (normal). Changepoint: demand acceleration P17+ (2 periods 100+ vs prior avg51, emerging sustained summer signal). Set L explicit=3 to buffer losses/delays beyond promised LT2 (observed LTs avg1.5 but ignores lost); mu_hat recent_N=5 (P14-P18:55,52,54,106,139 mean=81.2 \u2192 (1+3)*81.2=325 base, high service for spikes); sigma_hat recent_N=5 (std~39 \u2192 sqrt(4)*39~78, covers vol); drives higher base_stock despite ghost pipeline, balancing profit via sales vs holding (low on-hand now).

Period 20 (2019/6/24, summer start). Women's microfibre thong briefs: steady category but recent demand spike P17-P19 (106,139,84 avg 109.7, +115% vs P13-P16 avg 51.4). On-hand 14 low vs ~110 demand (likely stockout P20). In-transit 402 inflated by sustained lost shipments (~325 confirmed + P17 77u delayed/absent P19 conclude, overdue 1+ past LT2; total lost pattern implies ~50% delivery rate). Observed LTs avg~1.4 (9 arrivals: mostly 1-2), but unobserved losses/delay bias low; explicit L=3 best estimate for effective coverage given unreliability. Explicit mu_hat=700 covers ~4 periods inflated demand (110*4*1.6 loss adjust) to yield base_stock >>416 pipeline forcing orders. Explicit sigma_hat=100 captures/inflates recent vol (last5 std~33) for buffer/service. Ensures OR ignores bogus pipeline, orders ~250u (2+ periods demand), balancing lost risk vs holding (q=0.8 high service). Cap ample ~250u.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand spike sustained P17-P19 avg110 (+115% vs P13-P16 avg51); P17 order 77u delayed beyond LT2 (absent expected P19 conclude, 1+ periods past)

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1, early summer Monday post-Independence Day week start). Women's thong underwear demand sustained high in summer heat: P17-P20 avg 106.8 (106,139,84,98 all >80, +110% vs P13-P16 avg51), expect continuation ~110/period. On-hand=0 chronic stockouts; in-transit=660u (total ordered 1068u, arrived 408u=38% delivery rate), stuck with lost shipments (e.g. P1/3/10/13/14/17 confirmed absent multiple periods past LT2). Recent LTs stable mix 1-2 (last 3 observed: 2,1,1 avg1.33). To counter ghost pipeline suppressing orders (base < pipe => permanent 0 orders), explicitly inflate mu_hat=1000 (~9.5x recent 3pd demand 320, offsets ~660 lost inv), sigma_hat=200 (high vol for safety ~168u, recent std low but spikes justify); L recent_3 for accurate LT~1.33 (1+L~2.33pd). Yields base~1168 >660 pipe (order~508), cap~1000/2.33 +1.64*200/sqrt(2.33)~429+214=643 >508. Rebuilds real pipeline despite unreliable supplier.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern sustained: P17(77u) confirmed lost (absent P19-P20 concludes, 3+ periods past LT2), cumulative in-transit 660u mostly lost (38% historical delivery rate 408/1068); Summer demand spike extended P17-P20 avg106.8 (+110% vs P13-P16 avg51, all >=84).

======================================================================

On-hand=0, in-transit=1169 (cumulative lost ~62% undelivered per carry-over 38% delivery rate; recent lost P17 77u confirmed, P20 258u/P21 509u pending LT2 expected P22/P23). Pipeline inflated by lost shipments (no new overdue confirmations yet). Observed LTs: 9 arrivals avg~1.44 (seq 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,1; recent mixed 1-2). Use 'calculate' for L (avg all observed ~1.44 vs promised 2, reflects actual shorter when deliver). Demand params 'recent_N' N=5 (changepoint P17 summer shift, regime=5>=3; mean107.8, std~20.4). Params yield high mu_hat~(1+1.44)*107.8~280, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.44)*20.4~32; boosts base_stock >> pipeline losses/cap to order aggressively vs stockouts, balancing q=0.8 service vs holding.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15, mid-summer): sustained summer demand spike for women's thong underwear, driven by hot weather; P17-P22 demands 106-114 (avg 108.8, +110% vs P13-P16 avg 51), 6-period regime confirmed (all >=84, no drop). On-hand 144 covers ~1 period demand; in-transit 911 severely inflated by confirmed lost shipments (cumulative delivery 42% 666/1577 ordered thru P22, many ghosts like P1/3/13/14/17). P21 order 509 expected arrive P23 (LT2) but high loss risk per pattern. Reconcile: recent arrivals ok (P20->P22 LT2), but ghosts overstate IP~1055; effective IP closer to on-hand 144 + pending P21 (if delivers). To bridge backend's unawareness of losses, inflate base-stock target >> reported IP: L=calculate (observed avg LT 1.5 from 10 arrivals: 5x1, 5x2); explicit mu_hat=1300 (~12 periods x108.8 demand, ample buffer vs unreliable supply); explicit sigma_hat=100 (elevated vs recent per-period sd~18, adds ~84 safety stock at z~0.84). Forces order ~ (1300+84) -1055 ~329 (under cap~520+100), replenishes true needs despite ghosts, balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding by building position for sustained high demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand spike sustained P17-P22 avg 108.8 (+110% vs P13-P16 avg 51); 6 consecutive periods >=84 confirming regime extension.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22), late summer peak for women's thong underwear; sustained high demand regime P17-P23 avg 108.6 (760/7, +110% vs P1-P16 avg~46), 7 consecutive periods >=84 confirming no reversal. On-hand 546 covers ~5 periods at 108/wk; in-transit 732 inflates pipeline (total ordered 1907, arrived 1175, effective delivery ~62% incl. recent LT2 successes P20/258u P21/509u but prior losses like P17/77u overdue 5+ periods). Recent LTs avg~1.7 (last 5: 2,2,1,2,1). Default L=2 (matches promised/recent successes); recent_N N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat shifts to current regime (mu_hat~(1+2)*108.6=326, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*17=29), inflating base_stock to compensate ghost inventory & ensure (L+1)=3 periods coverage at high demand, balancing q=0.8 service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand spike extended P17-P23 avg 108.6 (+110% vs P1-P16 ~46), 7 consecutive >=84; recent deliveries improved (P20/P21 LT2 successes) but losses persist (P17 77u absent P19-P23).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29), late summer; women's thong underwear in sustained summer demand spike P17-P24 avg 105.3 (8 periods, 7/8 >=82, +110% vs P1-P16 avg~46). On-hand 464 (~4wks), in-transit 732 overstated by persistent losses (~400u est. at 55-62% non-delivery hist., effective reliable ~464+330 P23 expected LT2 + recent reliable ~800 or 7-8wks). Recent LT successes (P20/P21 full LT2), but losses inflate pipeline causing OR underorder. Target base_stock ~1300-1360 (12wks demand 105*12 + safety) to prompt moderate order ~100-160 replenishing effective position vs future summer demand, balancing service (avoid stockout post-summer?) vs holding ($1/u). L default (promised 2, recent successes LT2). mu_hat explicit 1300 covers inflated pipeline. sigma_hat explicit 60 (~2x recent sqrt(3)*18=31) boosts safety stock ~48u.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand spike extended P17-P24 avg 105.3 (+110% vs P1-P16 avg 46), 8 periods sustained (min 82, 106-139 peak); recent delivery successes LT2 full: P20(258u P22), P21(509u P23)

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5), early August mid-summer; Liza Thong women's underwear in sustained summer demand spike regime (P17-P25: 9 periods, demands 106/139/84/98/112/114/107/82/94 avg 104, min 82, +125% vs P1-P16 avg 46.25). On-hand 370 covers ~3.5 periods; in-transit 887 (total ordered 2062, arrived 1175, delivery rate 57% implying ~506 expected). Effective position ~876 >> target base_stock ~3*104 + z*sqrt(3)*17.4 ~312+25=337. Overdue: P23 order 330u absent P25 conclude (1+ past LT2), older losses persist but recent LT2 successes (P20/P21). No LT changepoint; default L=2. recent_N N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat uses summer regime (length=9, evidence: sustained high mean/variance post-P16). Ensures OR backend targets high service level for summer demand while high pipeline suppresses order qty, avoiding overstock/holding costs amid possible delays.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand spike extended P17-P25 avg 104 (+125% vs P1-P16 avg 46), 9 consecutive periods >=82 confirming regime; Delivery rate improved to 57% overall (1175 arrived / 2062 ordered), recent LT2 full successes (P20 258u P22, P21 509u P23) despite isolated delays (P23 330u 1+ past)

On-hand 639 covers ~6wks@100/d, in-transit 557 (includes P25=155 expected LT2 arrive P27 after decision; recent deliveries: P23@330 LT3 P26, P21 LT2 P23, P20 LT2 P22 succeeding; older losses per carry-over but recent 57% delivery improved). No new overdues. L recent_5 (LTs: P26 LT3, P23 LT2, P22 LT2, P19 LT1, P17 LT2; avg~2) accounts for recent LT2-3 mix. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_10 captures summer changepoint regime (N=10=min(regime_len10,20)), mu~(3)*100=300 higher for spike, sigma~sqrt(3)*~22=38 for elevated vol; boosts base_stock/pipline target to cover demand+L despite partial losses (OR subtracts full in-transit, higher params offset overstated pipeline), balances high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding with ample current inv.

High on-hand=734 (~12 periods at 60d), in-transit=402 (likely mostly lost old shipments, recent P23/P25 delivered LT3/2); total pipeline covers 20+ periods. Recent LTs last 5 concluded: P27 LT2 (P25), P26 LT3 (P23), P23 LT2 (P21), P22 LT2 (P20), P19 LT1 (P18) avg=2.0. Losses pattern sustained but recent delivery rate improved ~57%. No new overdue flags. Changepoint evidence: demand drop post-P25, regime_length=2<3 so conservative; use recent_N=5 (P23-27 demands 107/82/94/61/60 mean~80.8 std~20.5) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to adapt downward vs prior high regime/default (all-history mean~65), recent_N=5 LT for L~2. Lowers base_stock to cut holding costs on excess inv while high q=0.8 maintains service; cap limits overorder.

Post-summer demand drop confirmed P26-P28: 61,60,61 (avg 60.7, -37% vs P25 94, -42% vs P17-P25 summer avg~105), sustained 3 consecutive periods matching early-year historical ~60; changepoint at P26 with regime_length=3. High pipeline (673 on-hand +402 in-transit=1075) covers 15+ periods at 60/demand; historical losses persist (in-transit likely includes undelivered), but recent deliveries reliable (P25 LT2 P27, P23 LT3 P26, P21/P20 LT2). L recent_5 (last 5 observed LTs: P27 LT2, P26 LT3, P23 LT2, P22 LT2, P19 LT1 \u2192 avg 2.0). mu_hat recent_3 (backend: (1+L)*60.7 ~182 for L~2). sigma_hat recent_3 (backend: sqrt(1+L)*std~0.58 \u2192 ~1.0 low vol). Lowers base_stock ~182+0.84*1~183 << pipeline, prevents overordering/holding amid low demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand drop regime P26-P28 avg60.7 (-40% vs P17-P25 avg105), sustained 3 consecutive periods at 60-61 confirming shift

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2, early Sep post-Labor Day, women's thong underwear - steady demand post-summer). Post-summer demand drop regime changepoint P26 sustained P26-P29 avg63.3 (61,60,61,71; -40% vs P17-P25 summer avg105), low vol std~5.2, regime_length=4 \u2192 N=4. High pipeline: on-hand602 + in-transit402=1004 covers ~16pd at 63dem; no new overdue arrivals (recent expected LT2 from P27/P28 ord=0 arrived none as expected; prior P25 LT2 P27 success). Recent LTs last5 obs (P27:2,P26:3,P23:2,P22:2,P19:1) avg2.0. Use recent_N N=5 for L=2.0 bridging occasional LT3/losses; recent_N N=4 for mu_hat=(1+2)*63.3~190, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*5.2~9 low vol matching regime. Low params \u2192 low base_stock ~190 +0.84*9~198; order=0 vs pipeline1004 minimizes holding cost while covering demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9): Early September, post-Labor Day/back-to-school period for women's thong underwear; post-summer demand drop regime sustained P26-P30 (demands 61,60,61,71,61; avg 62.8, -40% vs P17-P25 summer avg 105), low variance confirming stable low-demand shift. High on-hand 541 (~9 periods at 62/demand) + in-transit 402 (recent delivery improved ~57% rate, no new prolonged losses beyond known patterns; recent LT successes P25@LT2 P27, P23@LT3 P26 isolated). Changeloint at P26 drop, regime_length=5 >=3, so recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low mu_hat~(1+2)*62.8=188, low sigma~sqrt(3)*~4.5~8 reflecting regime, minimizing base_stock/order to cut holding on excess inv. Recent 5 LT (P19 LT1,P22 LT2,P23 LT2,P26 LT3,P27 LT2 avg=2.0) matches promised, use recent_N N=5 for L to inform backend accurately despite variability/lost history.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16), mid-September post-summer/back-to-school period for women's thong lingerie; no major holidays imminent. Post-summer demand drop regime sustained P26-P31 (demands 61,60,61,71,61,43; avg 59.5, -40% vs P17-P25 summer avg~105), regime length=6 confirmed by 6 consecutive periods below summer highs. P31=43 (-33% vs P26-P30 avg62) hints further softening but single period, not sustained changepoint. On-hand=498 covers ~8 periods at 60/d demand; in-transit=402 unreliable (historical 57% delivery, persistent losses but recent successes). Recent LTs from last 5 successes: P27(LT2), P26(LT3), P23(LT2), P22(LT2), P19(LT1); avg=2.0. High on-hand warrants conservative base-stock. Use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on drop regime (lowers mu_hat~(1+2)*59.5~179, sigma~sqrt(3)*9~16 vs summer highs), recent_N N=5 for L=~2.0 matching actual avg not promised; OR backend's base_stock=mu + z*sigma (z~0.84 for q=4/5=0.8) + cap reduces overstock risk while covering (L+1)~3 periods demand, minimizing holding on excess inv.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23 late Sept, post-summer, no imminent holidays like Halloween/Thanksgiving; womens thong underwear demand stable but seasonal). Post-summer demand drop regime sustained P26-P32 (7 periods: 61,60,61,71,61,43,38 avg 56.4, -46% vs summer P17-P25 avg105), recent P30-P32 (61,43,38 avg47.3) softens further but only 3 periods not yet 3+ consecutive low signaling new changepoint. On-hand 460 high (covers 10+ periods at 45-50 avg), in-transit 402 likely includes lost/old shipments (historical delivery ~57%). Recent LTs last 5 obs: P25 LT2, P23 LT3, P21 LT2, P20 LT2, P18 LT1 avg2.0 matching promised; losses persist but recent arrivals reliable LT2-3, no LT shift evidence. Set L default (promised 2). mu_hat recent_7 (regime length 7, mean~56.4 x3=169) lowers base stock vs all-time/summer to cut holding on high inv. sigma_hat recent_7 captures regime vol (higher due to drop) for balanced q=0.8 service vs cost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): Late September, post-summer period for women's thong underwear; demand drop regime sustained P26-P33 (8 periods, avg 56.4, -46% vs P17-P25 summer avg105), with further drop evident P31-P33 avg45.7 (-27% vs P26-P30 62.8, sustained 3 periods:43,38,56). High on-hand 404 covers ~7 periods at recent avg; in-transit 402 likely mostly lost (persistent pattern, no recent orders so no new arrivals, recent successes LT2/3 but cumulative delivery ~57%). Reconciled pipeline unreliable due to losses. Changepoint: post-summer drop at P26 (regime_length=8>3, N=8). Recent LTs (last 5 concluded: P25@LT2, P23@LT3, P21@LT2, P20@LT2, P18@LT1, avg=2.0).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7): Early October, no major lingerie demand drivers imminent (post-summer decline continued, approaching Thanksgiving/Halloween but underwear steady). Recent demands P31-P34:43,38,56,42 (avg44.8, confirming further drop sub-regime vs P26-P30 avg62.8). On-hand 362 + in-transit 402 (stagnant, likely accumulated lost shipments; no recent orders P26-P34 so no new overdues). Observed LT recent 5 arrivals: LT1(P19),2(P22),2(P23),3(P26),2(P27) avg2.0. Chose L recent_5 N=5 (avg LT=2.0 matches promised, accounts for occasional LT3 without overbuffering). mu_hat recent_5 N=5 (P30-P34:61,43,38,56,42 avg48; regime_length=5 for extended drop, (1+L)~3 periods ~144). sigma_hat recent_5 N=5 (low recent vol std~9.9, sqrt(1+L)~1.73x~17). Parameters target low base_stock~144+0.84*17~159 << current pipeline 764, yielding order~0 to minimize holding costs on excess inventory amid low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Further post-summer demand drop sub-regime extended P31-P34 avg44.8 (-28% vs P26-P30 avg62.8), sustained 4 consecutive periods (43,38,56,42 confirming continued decline)

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Fall season, women's thong underwear demand in continued post-summer drop sub-regime P31-P35: demands 43,38,56,42,52 (avg 46.2, std~6.7, -27% vs P26-P30 avg62.8), sustained 5 periods with low volatility confirming regime (no major holidays imminent). On-hand 310 covers ~7 periods at current mean; in-transit 402 bloated w/ likely lost shipments (hist delivery ~57%, no recent orders post-P25 so no expected arrivals imminent). Recent LTs: P27 LT2, P26 LT3, P23 LT2, P22 LT2, P19 LT1 (last 5 avg 2.0). Use default L=2 (promised, matches recent avg); recent_N N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low demand/vol regime, yielding low base_stock~(1+2)*46.2=138 + z*~11 \u2192 ~150, far below pipeline 712 \u2192 order~0 minimizing holding costs while high q=4/5 favors service under low demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Late October, nearing Halloween (10/31) and start of holiday season (Thanksgiving/Black Friday late Nov); women's thong lingerie likely to see demand uptick for partywear/gift buying, shifting from sustained post-summer low regime (P31-P37 demands avg 45.1, range 36-56, std~7.3). On-hand 226 covers ~5 periods at 45/wk, but in-transit 402 stuck (no arrivals since P27 despite sustained loss pattern; cumulative lost >>delivered, delivery~57%). Pipeline overstated as lost shipments persist indefinitely. Recent LTs avg~2.25 (last 4 observed: LT2,3,2,2) but default L=2 sufficient with successes. Default params yield base~230 <628 pipeline, order=0 risking future stockouts. Override with explicit mu_hat=350 (equiv ~117/wk over L+1=3, calibrated to summer/holiday levels), sigma_hat=550 (elevated vol for safety amid uncertainty/losses); yields base~350+0.84*550~812 (>628+180 desired order), cap~350/3 +1.64*550/sqrt(3)~117+520~637>>180. Enables ~180 order-up-to rebuild effective inventory proactively for potential demand ramp, maximizing service (q=0.8) vs holding while bridging lost pipeline gap.

Carry-over insight: Further post-summer demand drop sub-regime extended P31-P37 avg45.1 (-27% vs P26-P30 avg62.8), sustained 7 consecutive periods (range 36-56 confirming continued low demand)

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4), early November pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday (late Nov ~P42-43), women's thong underwear; no demand uptick evidence yet despite holidays, sustained post-summer low demand regime P31-P38 (8 periods: demands 43,38,56,42,52,36,48,43; avg 44.75, -27% vs P26-P30 avg62.8; range 36-56 low vol). On-hand 183 covers ~4 periods; in-transit 587 high but ~40% historical delivery rate implies ~235 reliable, total coverage ample short-term; no new overdue shipments (P38 order 185 pending LT2 arrive P40). LT observations recent 5 (orders P18 LT1, P20 LT2, P21 LT2, P23 LT3, P25 LT2; avg 2.0). Parameters: L recent_N N=5 (avg LT2 buffers recent 1-3 mix/losses); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=8 (regime length=8, captures low mean/vol; backend base_stock ~3*44.75 + z*sigma_low ~140-150, OR orders 0 given pipeline~770 >> base_stock, avoids holding cost while monitoring holiday).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11): Post-summer low demand regime sustained P31-P39 (9 periods, avg 43, range 29-56 confirming continued decline per carry-over P38 insight); recent P37-P39 demands 48/43/29 avg 40 indicate persistence, no evidence of pre-Christmas/Thanksgiving uptick yet despite date proximity (Thanksgiving 11/28). On-hand 154 covers ~4 periods at 40 demand; in-transit 587 bloated w/ historical lost shipments (delivery rate ~57% historical), suppressing OR orders. Recent LT observations stable around 2-3 (last 4: P27 LT2, P26 LT3, P23 LT2, P22 LT2 avg 2.25). Set L recent_4 to target ~3.25 periods (~140 units), inflating base_stock vs default L2 (~129) to counteract phantom pipeline & losses. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_9 captures low regime changepoint at P31 (length 9>=3, evidence: -27% vs prior), ensuring service level for low mu~43 despite holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18), pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday (11/28-29), potential holiday uptick for women's thong underwear gifting/sales, but recent evidence shows continued low demand: P36-P40 demands 36,48,43,29,25 avg36.2; full P31-P40 avg41.2 sustained 10 periods low regime (-30% vs summer). On-hand 129 covers 3-5 periods at ~30-40 dmd; IT 587 likely mostly lost (no arrivals P28-P40=13 periods drought, P38 185u overdue past P40 conclude). High pipeline 716>> reasonable base_stock, backend orders 0 regardless - aligns with high holding cost avoidance. Set L default (promised 2, recent LTs avg~2); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_10 (N=10 for P31-P40 regime length=10, low mean41.2*3=123.6, low vol bridges low demand to low base_stock despite fake IT; cap irrelevant as base<<pipeline). Monitors holiday shift without overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Further post-summer demand drop sub-regime extended P38-P40 avg32.3 (-28% vs P31-P37 avg45.1), sustained 3 consecutive periods (43,29,25 confirming continued pre-holiday decline); Delivery drought sustained P28-P40 no arrivals (13 consecutive periods), losses pattern persists (IT 587u, P38 185u 1+ periods past LT2)

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Black Friday week (11/29 Fri in this period), start of holiday gifting season for women's lingerie thongs - anticipate sharp demand uptick to summer peak levels (~105 avg, max 139) overriding recent pre-holiday low regime P39-P41 avg 26 (-42% vs P31-P38 ~45). High apparent pipeline OH104 + IT587=691, but sustained lost shipment pattern (delivery ~57% historical, recent drought 14 periods P28-P41, P38 185u absent P40-P41 concludes =2+ past LT2) means effective position ~104 only, vulnerable to stockout on spike. Reconcile: no recent arrivals, IT bloated by losses. Use default L=2 (recent observed LTs avg~2). Explicit mu_hat=780 (1+2=3 periods x ~260/week BF/holiday peak forecast, inflated ~2.5x summer peak to counter ~50% lost rate & raise base_stock >691). Explicit sigma_hat=120 (high vol sqrt(3)~1.73 x sd~70 for regime shift uncertainty, adds z*~100 buffer). Yields base~780+0.84*120~780+101=881 >691 (order ~190 capped ~ mu/3=260 +1.645*120/sqrt3~260+114=374 buffer). Ensures aggressive replenishment despite fake IT, balancing high service for profit vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Delivery drought extended P28-P41 14 consecutive periods no arrivals; P38(185u) lost (absent P40-P41 concludes, 2+ periods past LT2); Pre-holiday demand drop regime P39-P41 avg26.3 (-42% vs P31-P38 avg45), sustained 3 periods confirming continued decline

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02), early Christmas holiday window (3 weeks to Dec 25); women's lingerie thongs prone to gifting spike like summer peak (avg108), but no evidence yet\u2014recent P39-P42 demand 29/25/25/38 avg29.3 sustained low (-36% vs P31-P38 avg45). On-hand 66 covers ~2 periods @30/demand; IT 777 severely inflated by delivery drought P28-P42 (15 periods no arrivals), P38 order 185u lost (absent P40-P42 concludes, overdue 3+ vs LT2), effective pipeline ~66 + minimal future arrivals (~100 from P42 190u if LT2). Reconcile: ghost IT ~650-700 lost. Compensate by explicit mu_hat=950 (3-period holiday forecast ~80/demand*3=240 + ~710 buffer for ghosts), L default=2 (promised, matches recent successes e.g. P25/P21 LT2), sigma_hat default (historical std~35 captures spike vol > recent low ~10). Yields base_stock~950 + 0.84*sqrt(3)*35~950+50=1000 >843 pipeline (order~157); cap~950/3 +1.64*60/1.73~317+57=374 >157. Forces buildup to true target ~300 (3*80 + safety) despite ghosts, balancing high service (q=0.8) vs holding while anticipating spike proactively.

Carry-over insight: Delivery drought extended P28-P42 15 consecutive periods no arrivals; P38(185u) lost (absent P40-P42 concludes, 3+ periods past LT2); Pre-holiday low demand regime extended P39-P42 avg29.3 (-36% vs P31-P38 avg45), sustained 4 consecutive periods (range 25-38 confirming continued decline despite Christmas proximity)

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), pre-Christmas (~16 days to Dec25), women's thong underwear (potential gift demand but no evidence of uptick). Recent pre-holiday low demand regime sustained P39-P43: demands 29,25,25,38,10 (avg25.4, std~10.1, -14% vs P39-P42 avg29.3, sharp drop confirmed by P43=10 despite holiday proximity). On-hand 56 covers ~2 periods at recent avg; IT 923 unreliable (delivery drought P28-P43 16 periods no arrivals, losses persist e.g. P38 185u confirmed lost). Pending P42 ord190 expected LT2 arrive during P44 (visible P45), P43 146u expected P45. Reconcile: high IT but lost pattern means low reliable pipeline. Changepoint: continued demand decline sustained 5 periods. Set mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 to capture low regime (backend: (1+L)*25.4 ~76 mean, sqrt(1+L)*10.1 vol), L 'calculate' uses all 13 observed LTs avg~1.69 (5 LT1/7 LT2/1 LT3) bridging variability/losses without overestimating. Balances low service need vs holding (q=4/5=0.8) while compensating unreliability via fitted stats; higher effective base stock vs default all-history high demand.

Carry-over insight: Delivery drought extended P28-P43 16 consecutive periods no arrivals; Pre-holiday demand drop regime extended P39-P43 avg25.4 (-14% vs P39-P42 avg29.3), sustained 5 periods with P43=10 confirming sharp continued decline despite Christmas proximity

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16): Pre-Christmas Monday, women's thong lingerie may see gifting demand spike in peak holiday shopping (Christmas Dec25 ~9 days away), despite sustained low demand regime P39-P44 avg23.7 (recent P43=10/P44=15), summer precedent for spikes (P17-P25 avg105). On-hand=41 low, IT=923 ghost inventory (delivery drought P28-P44 17 periods no arrivals, ~80%+ historical losses pattern, effective pipeline~41 only). Overdue/likely lost: P42(190u absent P44 conclude, 1+ past LT2), P43(146u arrives P45 post-decision invisible yet), P38(185u 6+ past). Recent demand changepoint sustained low no spike evidence, but holiday proximity warrants proactive coverage. L default=2 (promised, successful LT avg~1.7). mu_hat explicit=1050 (inflated 3pd@350pd>>historical max139 to force base_stock~1260>pipeline964 despite ghosts, target order~300 cover 3pd@100pd holiday potential). sigma_hat explicit=250 (elevated volatility for holiday uncertainty/loss risk, per pd~144). Boosts service (q=0.8) ordering ~296 (deficit after safety), cap~587 ample; balances lost sales vs future holding (likely lost shipment mitigates).

Carry-over insight: Delivery drought extended P28-P44 17 consecutive periods no arrivals; P42(190u) delayed beyond LT2 (absent P44 conclude, 1+ periods past); Pre-holiday demand drop regime extended P39-P44 avg23.7 (-47% vs P31-P37 avg45.1), sustained 6 consecutive periods (range 10-38) confirming persistent low demand despite Christmas proximity

On-hand 312 covers ~12 periods at 26/period, IT 884 overstated (persistent losses, ~57% delivery rate, recent successes P45 LT2/3 but drought history); expected P47 arrival P45's 297u (LT2). Reconcile: position 1196>> needs, order likely 0. Use explicit L=3 (recent LTs 2-3 avg2.3 + loss buffer, vs promised 2) to extend coverage for unreliable pipeline/delays. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=8 for low regime (backend: ~4*25.9=104 mu, low sigma~9*sqrt4~18), base_stock~104 + 0.84*18~120 << position triggers order=0 minimizing hold on excess inv while high-q=0.8 buffers stockouts if Jan uptick.

Carry-over insight: Post-Christmas low demand regime extended P39-P46 avg25.9 (-47% vs P31-P37 avg45.1), sustained 8 consecutive periods (range 10-38, incl Christmas week P46=29 confirming no holiday lift); Recent delivery successes sustained (P45 LT2/3 after 17-period drought)
