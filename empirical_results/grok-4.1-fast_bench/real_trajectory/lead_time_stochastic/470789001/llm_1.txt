(c) Lead time/missing: Promised 2; actual 1-2 or lost (sustained pattern: P1/3/13/14/17 lost, P19 overdue 2 periods post-P22 conclude - likely lost soon); P21 (250) exp arrive P23 (visible P23 conclude/P24); losses persist in in-transit indefinitely.

High holding risk if arrivals materialize. (e) Order logic: Forecast 130x(L+1=3 periods)=390 need; on-hand 177 + exp P21 250 ~427 covers with buffer; unreliable supplier/losses justify continued replenishment at 250 to hedge stockouts (past lost sales e.g. P21:121), balance vs holding; match recent order cadence.",

  "rationale": "(a) Product: Women's microfibre Brazilian briefs (lingerie/underwear bottoms). Date 2019/12/23: Christmas week peak (Dec 25 holiday), high retail demand for gifts, intimate apparel, party season outfits\u2014expect sustained/peak demand spike vs fall lows. (b) Demand regime: Holiday uptick sustained P42-45 avg87 (91/59/103/94, +115% from P31-41 avg39), 4 periods evidence into Christmas; prior summer peak ~155, winter early-year ~90\u2014forecast P46 ~100-120. (c) Lead time: Variability 1-3 confirmed (recent P42 LT3 P45, P43 LT2 P45, P40 LT3 P43); no new losses (reliability sustained post-P19); promised 2, plan for LT<=3 so cover 4 periods ahead. No overdue flags beyond known backlog. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 206 covers ~2 periods at 100 demand (risk if >200 spike); in-transit 1465 massive backlog (covers 15+ periods at 90-100, unexplained excess vs recent orders ~450 P40-43, likely delayed old shipments); total pipeline >> demand needs, but recent stockout P44 (demand103>91). (e) Final order: Despite backlog/holding pressure ($1/unit/period hurts on 1671 total), order 150 to buffer Christmas peak risk/stockout (as P44), matching recent order size; replenishes for post-holiday LT3 arrival ~P49 while pipeline digests.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) Product: Women's microfibre Brazilian briefs (underwear/lingerie). Steady demand with seasonal spikes; historical early-year (Jan-Feb 2019) avg~90; summer peak ~150-180 (May-Jun); low fall ~40 (Sep-Nov); current holiday uptick late Nov-Dec. Date 2019/12/30: Post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week\u2014lingerie demand likely sustained high (gifts, resolutions, sales) but potential slight drop post-peak, forecast ~80-90 vs prior holiday avg85. (b) Demand regime: Holiday uptick P42-46 sustained avg85 (91/59/103/94/79, +115% from P31-41 low avg39), 5 periods evidence into late Dec; no confirmed drop yet despite P46=79. (c) Lead time: Variability sustained LT=1-3 (recent: P42 LT3 P45, P43 LT2 P45, P40 LT3 P43); no new losses since P19 (supplier reliability sustained 20+ periods); no overdue confirmed in P46 conclude (arrived=0 expected as no LT=1 orders from P45); high in-transit backlog consistent with delays not losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=127 covers 1.5 periods@85 demand; massive in-transit=1615 (covers ~19 periods@85 or 40+@40, up from 1465 prior due to P46 order=150 addition, no arrival); total coverage excessive for foreseeable demand even if post-holiday drops to ~40. (e) Final order logic: Order 0\u2014127 on-hand satisfies P47 forecast 80-90 with buffer; avoid exacerbating holding costs ($1/unit/period) on already enormous 1615 pipeline amid LT=1-3 variability; prioritize drawing down inventory to maximize R_t as profit $4/sold but stockouts minimal recently with arrivals.",
