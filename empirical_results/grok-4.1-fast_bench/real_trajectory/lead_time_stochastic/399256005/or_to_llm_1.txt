{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: LT variability sustained (1-3 periods per carry-over; latest P45 arrive P43 order LT=2, P46 arrived=0 so P44's 250 potentially delayed/overdue past expected LT=2 arrival in P46). No new LT confirmations in P46 conclude. Pipeline: In-transit 2390 units (cumulative undelivered, including recent P44=250, P46=300, and backlog) + on-hand 279 provides massive coverage (>10 periods even at prior peaks ~250). Demand analysis: Recent deepening lull P43-46 avg 35 (56,40,29,16; -80% vs P42 holiday peak 169), post-Cyber Monday/Christmas suppression for denim jeans into late Dec 2019/12/23-30; calendar context (post-Christmas week) suggests continued low pre-NY demand, no immediate rebound signal despite historical Jan avg~73; summer/post-Labor Day lows were ~70 then ~50, now lower ~35 but inventory buffers fully. OR rec=0 aligns perfectly - its base-stock likely sees pipeline >> mu_hat + safety over promised LT=2; no override needed as stockout risk zero, holding cost minimal vs profit.
