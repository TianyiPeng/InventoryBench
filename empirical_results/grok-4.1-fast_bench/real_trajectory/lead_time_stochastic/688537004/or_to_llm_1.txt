  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised L=2, but extensive history of lost shipments (total 1909u confirmed lost, matching current in-transit); no reliable arrivals since P36 (180u from P35 L=1). All in-transit effectively lost, so pipeline=0 for planning. Inventory: On-hand=0, no reliable incoming. Demand analysis: Swimwear bottoms in late Dec 2019 (12/30, post-Christmas/New Year's Eve) - winter off-season trough confirmed by carry-over (P36-P39: avg 30u; recent P43-P46: avg ~30u (37/35/32/15), declining sharply). Historical peaks were spring-summer (e.g., P20=799u), now negligible. OR rec=0 based on historical mean/std (low due to full history), aligns perfectly with regime. Strategy: Order 0 to avoid holding costs in zero-demand winter; no need for safety stock as demand <20u expected even with holiday tail.",
