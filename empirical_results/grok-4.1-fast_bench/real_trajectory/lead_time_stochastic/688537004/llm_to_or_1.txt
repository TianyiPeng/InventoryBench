Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11), swimwear bottoms (cheeky tanga). Historical demand shows changepoint: first two weeks Jan 0, then 69 (1/21), 88 (1/28), 88 (2/4) indicating shift to high demand regime (~81.7 avg last 3). Current date follows last high-demand week, likely continuation in stable high-demand phase for swimwear (possible early season ramp-up). No prior orders, on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Use recent_3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime (N=3=max(min(regime_length=3,20),3)), L=default (promised 2, no observed LTs yet). This raises mu_hat to ~3*81.7=245 and lowers sigma_hat relative to full history (recent std~10.8 vs full~42), improving service level for ~82/wk demand while backend caps overstock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-01-21: avg from 0 (first 2 wks) to 81.7 (+infinite%) sustained over 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18), swimwear product. Demand regime shift to high ~80 sustained since 2019-01-21 (69,88,88) confirmed in carry-over; Period 1 demand=77 continues pattern (avg last 4=80.5). No inventory, stockout in Period 1. In-transit=100 from Period 1 order, no arrivals yet (expected Period 3 with L=2, no concluded arrivals to infer actual LT). Swimwear in Feb not peak season but demand elevated, no major calendar events imminent. Use default L (promised 2). mu_hat recent_N=4 captures sustained regime (N=4 as regime_length>=4). sigma_hat recent_N=4 for low recent volatility (vs high if including initial 0s). Parameters target base_stock ~241 + buffer, minus pipeline 100, to cover 3 periods demand post-stockout, balancing q=4/5=0.8 service vs holding.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25): Swimwear (bikini bottoms) in late winter; demand regime shift to high levels (~83 avg) confirmed from 2019-01-21 onward (samples:69,88,88,77,94 over 5 periods). No arrivals observed yet, as expected (Period 1 order arrives during Period 3 if LT=2, visible in Period 4; Period 2 in Period 4). In-transit 196 matches prior orders (100+96). No overdue shipments or losses. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture sustained high-demand regime (N=5 matches regime length since changepoint, min(20,5)). L default (promised 2, no observed LTs yet). This boosts base_stock to cover ~83*(1+2)=249 demand over review+LT while recent sigma keeps it efficient vs holding costs; OR cap limits overorder.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4): Early March swimwear (cheeky tanga bottoms); high demand regime confirmed since 2019-01-21 (~81/period avg over last 6 samples: 69,88,88,77,94,69; std ~10.7), sustained including recent game periods (P1:77, P2:94, P3:69). Ongoing stockouts (on-hand=0 every period). No arrivals yet; P1 order (100u) overdue past promised LT=2 (expected P3 arrival, but P3 conclude arrived=0), suggesting possible LT drift or loss\u2014bridge by explicit L=3. In-transit=265 vs 4-period demand ~323. recent_N N=6 captures regime (length=6>3). default profit/hc q=4/5=0.8 z~0.84 yields base~323+18=341, order~76 (vs 0 if L=2), buffers potential losses/delays while controlling holding.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Early March swimwear (bikini bottoms); pre-summer season with stable high demand regime since 2019-01-21 changepoint (confirmed sustained: last 7 demands 69,88,88,77,94,69,79 avg~80.6). On-hand=17 low; in-transit=246 (P1:100 overdue since expected P3 arrival, not seen in P3/P4 concludes; P3:69 expected arrive during P5 after decision; P4:77 expected P6). Only 1 confirmed LT=2 (P2 order arrived P4); P1 overdue suggests possible loss/delay but not sustained evidence for LT change. Use default L=2 (promised). recent_7 for mu/sigma captures high-demand regime (N=7=max(min(regime len=7,20),3)), excluding initial zeros: raises mu_hat~(1+2)*80.6=242 for high service (q=4/5=0.8), sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*std~11*sqrt3~19; OR backend orders to base_stock - pipeline (high pipeline limits new order), balancing stockout risk vs holding on expected arrivals.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6, 2019/3/18: Swimwear bottoms, early spring (post-winter, pre-summer), demand rising seasonally - recent P5=124 (+57% vs prior 4-period avg~80), consistent with carry-over regime shift to ~82 avg since 2019-01-21 sustained 5+ game periods (demands:77,94,69,79,124; mean=88.6, std~21.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=246 (likely P1:100 + P3:69 + P4:77). Reconcile arrivals: only P2\u2192P4 (L=2 observed once); P1 overdue past P3 conclude (expected if L=2), P3 overdue past P5 - signals losses/delays, pipeline unreliable. Use explicit L=3 to extend coverage to (1+3)=4 periods (~354 mean demand), compensating backend for actual >promised LT/losses. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=5 (regime_length=5>3, post-changepoint) to prioritize current high/vol regime vs historical low-demand seed. Boosts base_stock for service (q~0.8), caps overbuild; addresses stockouts (P5 lost 107 sales) while limiting holding on risky pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lost/delayed shipments pattern: P1 order (100u) overdue >3 periods past expected P3 conclude; P3 (69u) overdue 1+ period past P5; total ~169u potentially lost, in-transit unreliable.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Swimwear bottoms, late March approaching Easter (4/21) and summer season ramp-up; demand surging (P4:79, P5:124 +57%, P6:172 +39%) indicating new high-demand regime post early-year shift to ~80 avg. On-hand=0, in-transit=371 but unreliable (~246u potentially lost: P1:100 overdue >>3pd, P3:69 overdue >2pd past P5, P4:77 overdue >1pd past P6). Only 1 observed LT=2 (P2->P4). Reconcile: effective pipeline low despite 371 shown. Set L explicit=3 to inflate base_stock for delays/lost bridging backend's promised LT assumption; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=3 (demands 79/124/172 mean~125, std~38; for L=3: mu_hat~500, sigma_hat~sqrt(4)*38~76) captures recent surge/volatility. Ensures higher order-up-to covers (L+1)=4pd demand ~500 while high q=4/(4+1)=0.8 targets service > holding despite unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lost/delayed shipments pattern update: P4 order (77u) overdue >1 period past expected P6 conclude; total ~246u potentially lost (P1:100, P3:69, P4:77), in-transit unreliable sustained over 4+ orders.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): Swimwear bottoms, early spring approaching Easter (Apr 21), seasonal demand surge evident. Demand changepoint at P5: prior P1-4 avg ~80 (77,94,69,79), P5-7 avg 165 (124,172,198; +106%), sustained 3 periods confirming new high-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=573 (P6:125 + P7:202 + prior ~246 potentially lost per carry-over; P4 order=77 still overdue past expected P6 arrival). Only 1 observed LT=2 (P2->P4); losses overstate pipeline, reducing OR orders. Use default L=2 (no new LT data), recent_N=3 mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime len=3, N=3) for higher base_stock reflecting recent mean/vol ~165/38 vs all-hist ~116/44; boosts service (q=0.8) to cover unmet demand/rising trend despite unreliable pipeline, minimizing stockouts while capping overorder risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: avg increased from 80 (P1-4) to 165 (P5-7) (+106%) sustained over 3 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

In-transit 246u likely lost (P1:100 overdue 6+pd, P3:69 overdue 4+pd, P4:77 overdue 3+pd; recent P6 LT2, P7 LT1 reliable). On-hand 18 low vs expected high demand ~250+. L recent_3 (last observed LTs: P2@2, P6@2, P7@1; avg~1.67 < promised 2, adjusts for shortening). mu_hat recent_4 (P5-8 regime length=4>3, (1+L)*200.75 ~602 covers surge). sigma_hat recent_4 (captures vol=71.4 vs all-history low std~12, boosts safety stock for stockouts). Params raise base_stock/q to aggressively order vs holding, compensating OR backend's ignorance of losses/short LTs; cap limits overorder.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 5: avg P5-8=201 (+52% from P5-7=165), sustained 4 periods with P8=309 peak.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22): Swimwear demand in late April remains in high regime (P5-10: demands 124,172,198,309,308,306; avg 236, sustained 6+ periods post-P5 shift, +~200% from early avg ~80; seasonal rise into summer expected). On-hand=24 low vs recent ~300 demand; in-transit=605 but unreliable (past losses ~246u from P1/3/4 confirmed overdue >promised, sustained pattern; recent orders P10=359 pending). Observed LTs: P2->P4(2), P6->P8(2), P7->P8(1), P9->P10(1); recent avg 1.5 vs promised 2, so use recent_4 for L to adjust backend for shorter actual LTs. Mu/sigma recent_6 to capture sustained high mean/vol regime (chngpt P5 validated by 6 periods), boosting base_stock for (1+L)~2.5 periods coverage ~590 demand while accounting for losses/risk via higher service level. Helps OR balance by inflating forecast over promised LT/historical low-demand stats.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29): Late spring swimwear (bikini bottoms), seasonal demand ramp into summer evident with sustained high regime P8-P11 avg 339 (309,308,306,433; +68% vs prior P5-P7 avg165), changepoint at P8 confirmed by 4 periods high demand including P11=433 peak. On-hand=0, in-transit=804 includes ~246u confirmed lost (P1:100, P3:69, P4:77 overdue >>LT2) + pending P10:359 (expected P12 arrive LT2), P11:199 (P13); pipeline unreliable. Use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high recent demand/vol (mean339 * (1+L), std~52 *sqrt(1+L)) for base_stock ~3*339 +0.84*3*52 ~1140, offsets phantom pipeline to order ~1140-804=336 despite cap. For L recent_N N=4 (observed LTs: P2order:2, P6:2, P7:1, P9:1 avg1.5) vs promised2, lower L reduces (1+L) coverage but recent evidence; balances service vs holding given losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: avg P8-P11=339 (+68% from P5-P7=165), sustained 4 periods; swimwear late-spring/summer ramp confirmed (P11=433 peak). Recent LT avg 1.5 (last 4 obs: P2:2,P6:2,P7:1,P9:1), lower than promised 2.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6): Early May, swimwear in late-spring/summer ramp-up phase; demand sustained high P8-P12 (309,308,306,433,383) avg 348 (+68% from prior regime), regime shift at P8 confirmed over 5 periods, expect continued peak into summer (Memorial Day ~5/27). On-hand=0 (stockout P12 demand=383), in-transit=1109 unreliable (sustained losses: P1/100,P3/69,P4/77,P10/359 overdue past expected P12 arr). Observed LTs last 4: P2ord@P4(L2),P6@P8(L2),P7@P8(L1),P9@P10(L1) avg1.5< promised2. Set L recent_4 for shorter LT; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 for elevated summer demand/volatility (mean~348, std~54), boosting base_stock to cover (L+1)~2.5 periods high demand minus unreliable pipeline, balancing service vs holding amid losses/stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lost/delayed shipments pattern update: P10 order (359u) overdue past expected P12 conclude; total ~605u potentially lost (P1:100,P3:69,P4:77,P10:359), in-transit unreliable sustained over 5+ orders.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13): Mid-May, peak swimwear season (late-spring/summer ramp confirmed in carry-over, sustained high demand P8-P13 avg 343, range 306-433). On-hand=0, high stockout risk; in-transit=929 includes unreliable historical losses (~605u: P1:100,P3:69,P4:77,P10:359) + recent P12:305 + P13:19, but pattern of losses sustained\u2014do not fully count pipeline. Observed LTs: 5 arrivals (P2 ord LT2@P4, P6 LT2@P8, P7 LT1@P8, P9 LT1@P10, P11 LT2@P13), recent avg 1.6 (last 5). Demand regime stable high since P8 (6 periods, no new changepoint). Use recent_N N=5 for L (lower avg 1.6 vs promised 2, reflects evidence); recent_N N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (captures sustained peak mean~343/vol~50, mu_hat~(1+1.6)*343~891 to build base_stock covering ~2.6 periods demand despite losses; higher service level via recent high mu/sigma offsets unreliable pipeline/holding costs.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20): Women's swimwear bottoms (cheeky tanga), late spring/early summer peak ramp confirmed (carry-over P12 swimwear ramp P8-P11 peak 433), Memorial Day holiday (US 2019-05-27, likely P16) upcoming - anticipate demand spike >=400 based on beach/swim season calendar driver. On-hand 0, in-transit 803 unreliable (carry-over sustained lost ~605u incl P1:100/P3:69/P4:77/P10:359 + pending recent P13:19/P14:179). Demand changepoint P8 (carry-over), sustained high regime P8-P14 (7 periods: 309/308/306/433/383/322/364 avg=346, std~49 confirmed volatile). Observed LTs 6 concluded (2,2,1,1,2,2 avg=1.67< promised 2 but recent 2s). Reconcile: recent arrivals reliable LT~2 (P11/P12), old lost bloat pipeline. Use default L=2 (conservative >obs avg, buffers lost/delays per explicit guidance). recent_N N=7 (regime_length=7) for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures high mean/volatility vs default low early demands (overall mean~231); sets mu_hat~(1+2)*346=1038, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*49~85, z~0.84 -> base_stock~1100+ high to overcome pipeline subtract (effective ~200 reliable), order aggressively ~900 vs cap, covers 3pd demand ~1050+ high service for profit=4 vs holding=1.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27 Memorial Day): Swimwear in peak summer ramp-up season; demand regime stable high since P8 (avg P8-P15=346, sustained 8 periods, peaks like P11=433). Recent demand P11-P15 avg 370 suggests possible holiday spike. On-hand=0, in-transit=1111 but unreliable (multiple losses confirmed, e.g., P13 order 19 overdue past P15). LT observed recent 6: 2(P2-P4),2(P6-P8),1(P7-P8),1(P9-P10),2(P11-P13),2(P12-P14) avg~1.67; use recent_N N=6 for L to reflect lower actual avg vs promised 2. Mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to capture sustained high demand/volatility regime (early history low irrelevant). This boosts base_stock >1111 despite losses (q=0.8 high service), covers ~2.67 periods demand (~923 mean), aggressive cap, balances stockouts vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost/delayed shipments pattern update: P13 order (19u) overdue past expected P15 conclude (arrived=0); total ~624u potentially lost (P1:100,P3:69,P4:77,P10:359,P13:19), in-transit unreliable sustained over 6+ orders.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3): Peak summer swimwear season, post-Memorial Day (P16 demand=538, new high). Recent demand P12-P16: 383,322,364,346,538 (mean=391, sd~85, high vol). On-hand=0, in-transit=1111 unreliable (sustained losses ~600+u prior, P14=179 overdue past P16 arrived=0). No arrivals in P16 despite expectations. Explicit L=3 to account for delays/losses (observed LT avg~1.7 but effective longer due to missing shipments). mu_hat recent_N=5: (1+3)*391~1564 targets high summer demand over extended review+lead. sigma_hat recent_N=5 captures vol. Raises base_stock > pipeline (1111), forces order to prevent stockouts (recent sales lost e.g. P16=538 sold=0), balances profit vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost/delayed shipments pattern update: P14 order (179u) overdue past expected P16 conclude (arrived=0); total ~803u potentially lost (P1:100,P3:69,P4:77,P10:359,P13:19,P14:179), in-transit unreliable sustained over 7+ orders.

On-hand=0, in-transit=1335 bloated by ~803 lost/ghost units (P1:100,P3:69,P4:77,P10:359,P13:19,P14:179 overdue >>expected) + P17:532 pending. Frequent stockouts (P17 sold308/379). Recent LTs stable at 2 (last 3 obs: P15/P12/P11 orders). To counter ghost pipeline suppressing orders, set L=explicit 3 (buffer losses/delays, effective LT uncertainty); mu_hat=recent_N N=5 ((1+3)*390\u22481560 >1335 pipeline for base_stock excess); sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 (high recent vol~86, sqrt(4)*86\u2248172 boosts safety stock).

On-hand=0, in-transit=1704 includes ~605 historical lost (P1,3,4,10 etc.), ~198 recent overdue (P13=19 past P15, P14=179 past P16), reliable recent P17=532 (due P19 LT2), P18=369 (due P20); effective pipeline ~900.

To bridge unreliable pipeline gap, use L recent_N N=5 (1.8); explicit mu_hat=2100 (~750/period, 95% inflation over recent 384 to compensate ~40% effective loss rate for target coverage); sigma_hat=250 (inflated ~90% from sqrt(2.8)*77\u2248130 for higher service/z & cap).

In-transit=1942 unreliable: ~1335u potentially lost (historic overdues incl. new P17:532 past P19 conclude), overstated pipeline causes underordering. Observed LTs stable mix 1-2; recent 4 avg=1.75 (P11:2,P12:2,P15:2,P18:1). Use recent_N N=4 for L (lower LT=1.75), mu_hat (444*(1+1.75)=~1223), sigma_hat (recent std~92 * sqrt(2.75)~153) to set high base_stock target >> overstated pipeline, boosting orders/service level vs holding, bridging losses/unreliable transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg P16-P19=444 (+25% from P12-P15=354), sustained 4 periods; swimwear late-June/summer peak accelerating. Lost/delayed shipments pattern update: P17 order (532u) overdue past expected P19 conclude; total ~1335u potentially lost (prev~803+532), in-transit unreliable sustained over 8+ orders.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01): Peak summer for swimwear (bikini bottoms), demand accelerating into July with P20=799 (+57% vs prior regime avg 444 P16-19), recent 5 periods (P16-20) avg=515 (538,379,352,505,799), high volatility std~163. On-hand=0 after P20 stockout, in-transit=1942 unreliable (history of ~1335u lost, sustained pattern). No new arrivals in P20 confirm ongoing delays/losses for prior orders (e.g., P17=532 overdue past P19). LT recent 5 observed (P19c:1, P17c:2, P14c:2, P13c:2, P10c:1) avg=1.6 < promised 2. No new sustained changepoint (P20 spike single period <3). Set L=recent_N N=5 for accurate avg LT; mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 to capture rising mean/vol in summer peak regime (N=5 as regime length from P16 shift). This boosts mu_hat~(1+1.6)*515~1339, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.6)*163~262, raising base_stock/q-service (q=4/5=0.8) to overorder compensating unreliable pipeline, prioritizing sales vs holding amid stockouts.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08): Peak summer for swimwear bottoms, demand sustained high/volatile post-July 4th (P20=799 peak, P21=540); regime from P16-P21 avg=519 (+17% from P16-P19=444), std~238 (high vol). On-hand=0 (stockout P21), in-transit=1942 unreliable per sustained losses (P19:607 overdue past P21 LT2 expected, total ~1942u lost equiv.). Observed LTs recent: P19:1(P18), P17:2(P15), P14:2(P12), P13:2(P11), P10:1(P9), P8:1(P7)/2(P6) avg~1.5-1.7 < promised 2. Use recent_6 for L/mu/sigma to capture current high-demand regime, recent LT avg, high vol; boosts base_stock/mu over ~2.5-3 periods (~1300-1500) for service despite losses, limits cap overbuy while aggressive ordering needed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 16: avg P16-P21=519 (+17% from P16-P19=444), sustained 6 periods, high vol (std~238, P20=799); swimwear July peak ongoing. Lost/delayed shipments pattern update: P19 order (607u) overdue past expected P21 conclude; total ~1942u potentially lost (matches in-transit), unreliable sustained over 9+ orders.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15 mid-July): Swimwear in peak summer season, recent demand P16-P22 avg 514 (sustained high regime from P16, evidence: 538,379,352,505,799,540,483), std~146 (stabilized from prior ~160-238). On-hand=0, in-transit=1942 matches sustained lost shipments pattern (~9+ orders, no recent arrivals e.g. P22 arrived=0, P19 607u overdue past P21). Phantom pipeline causes backend under-order (base < pipeline \u2192 order=0); inflate explicit mu_hat=2300 (~3*767 period forecast, above recent 514/799 peak to compensate losses), sigma_hat=300 (~sqrt(3)*173 matching recent vol) for L=2: base~2300 + 0.84*300\u22482552, order~610 (min(610, cap~767+285=1052)); ensures coverage for current/future demand despite unreliable transit, balancing service (avoid stockouts) vs holding.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22): Late July swimwear peak ongoing (summer season), demand sustained high in recent regime from P16 (avg 504 over P16-P23: 538,379,352,505,799,540,483,436), high volatility (std ~138), slight decline in last 3 (P21-P23 avg 486) not yet sustained changepoint (short, still >> early). On-hand 0 (stockouts continue), in-transit 2553 unreliable (carry-over sustained losses ~1942u up to P19 + more overdue like P17:532 past P19, no P23 arrival confirms pattern). Pipeline reconciliation: expected P24 arrivals (e.g., P22 ord=0 LT2 none; older overdue). Observed LTs (8 total, recent): mix 1-2, avg 1.625 all, 1.75 last 4 (P11:2,P12:2,P15:2,P18:1). Use recent_N N=8 for L (avg~1.6, reflects lower observed vs promised 2), mu_hat (504 mean captures summer ramp/peak vs old low samples), sigma_hat (high vol for uncertainty/losses). Parameters boost base stock q=4/(4+1)=0.8 service, recent demand overrides low priors, lower L tightens policy but high sigma/mu covers (1+L)~2.6 periods demand ~1300+ safety; compensates unreliability by aggressive ordering despite cap.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29): Late July swimwear peak; demand regime sustained high since P16 (9 periods, P16-P24 avg=527, std=147 volatile with peaks 713/799). On-hand=0, in-transit=2553 bloated (unreliable per history, no arrivals P20-P24 concludes=5 periods). Observed LTs avg~1.6 (8 obs: 2,2,1,1,2,2,2,1) but losses make effective longer. Set L explicit=5 to inflate base_stock~ (6*527)+0.84*(sqrt(6)*147) ~3162+302=3464 >2553+~769 cap (527+1.645*147), enabling max order~769 to cover imminent demand/service despite ghosts. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=9 captures current regime (backend scales by 1+L=6). Addresses losses by boosting base_stock over bloated pipeline for higher service (q=0.8), low holding risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 16: avg P16-P24=527 sustained 9 periods (4745/9), std=147 high vol; swimwear late-July/summer peak ongoing. Lost/delayed shipments pattern update: No arrivals P20-P24 (5 periods arrived=0); P17(532u)>P19 overdue, P19(607u)>P21 overdue, total ~2553u in-transit unreliable sustained 10+ orders.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05): Late summer for swimwear (cheeky tanga bikini bottoms); demand regime since P16 sustained 10 periods (P16-P25 avg=513, std~145.5), high vol consistent with July/Aug peak but P25=383 (-27% from prior 9-per avg 527) hints at possible early taper (within 1 std dev); no sustained drop yet (needs 3+ periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=3322 but unreliable per carry-over (no arrivals P20-P25=6 periods, total potentially lost ~3322u vs prior ~2553u, sustained losses suggest ~20-40% historical arrival rate). Observed LTs (8 arrived): avg=1.625, recent 4 (P11/P12/P15/P18 orders)=1.75; use default L=2 (promised, close to obs avg) but inflate mu_hat explicit to compensate unreliable pipeline. Estimated expected arrivals ~3322*0.3=~1000; desired base~(1+2)*513 + 0.84*sqrt(3)*145.5 ~1539+212=1751 \u2192 desired order~1751-1000=751 \u2192 target backend base~3322+751=4073 \u2192 mu_hat=4073-212~3860, set 4200 conservative (low arrival bias, allows ~1400 order toward cap, builds buffer vs losses/stockouts). Sigma recent_10 captures high vol. Balances high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding by inflating only for losses, not over-forecasting demand.

Carry-over insight: Lost/delayed shipments pattern update: No arrivals P20-P25 (6 periods arrived=0); P17(532u),P19(607u),P23(611u) etc. overdue, total 3322u potentially lost (up ~769 from prior), in-transit unreliable sustained over 11+ orders.

On-hand=366 covers ~1 period; in-transit=3802 unreliable (sustained losses/overdues per carry-over, sporadic arrivals e.g. P26=611 from P23 LT=3; no arrivals P20-P25). Observed LTs avg~1.8 all, recent 5=2.0 (P23:3,P18:1,P15:2,P12:2,P11:2). To bridge unreliable pipeline (overstated by losses), set L explicit=10 (effective LT much longer due to delays/losses >>promised 2, inflates base_stock~(1+10)*488 + safety >>4168 pipeline). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=11 (regime_length=11 from P16, P16-P26 demands avg=488, high std~190 captures summer peak/vol despite recent drop).

On-hand=955 covers multiple low-demand periods; in-transit=3785 unreliable (carry-over history of ~3300u+ lost/overdue, recent partial arrivals P27=769(P25 LT2), P26=611(P23 LT3) but no older e.g. P20/P21/P26 orders). Observed LTs recent 5: 2(P27),3(P26),1(P19),2(P17),2(P14) avg=2.0. Parameters use recent_N N=5 for L (matches promised, accurate avg); recent_N N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (captures new low mean/vol regime, mu~(1+2)*269=807 lowers base_stock vs prior high to cut holding on 955+unreliable pipeline, z~0.84 balances service; cap mitigates overorder).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: avg P25-P27=269 (std~91, -49% from P16-P24=527), sustained 3 periods; swimwear late-Aug post-summer decline confirmed.

On-hand=818 covers ~3-4 recent demand periods; in-transit=3785 unreliable (history of losses, e.g., many overdue like P26 1091u expected P28 but arrived=0). Recent LT observations avg~2 (last 5:2,3,1,2,2); no LT changepoint. Use default L (promised 2, matches avg); recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target low recent demand over 1+L=3 periods (mu~(1+2)*236=708, sigma~sqrt(3)*101~175), yielding conservative base_stock ~ mu + 0.84*sigma ~850 to match low demand/coverage while high pipeline overstated by losses reduces ordering, minimizing holding costs on excess.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 25: avg P25-P28=236 (std~101, -12% from P25-P27=269), sustained 4 periods; swimwear late-Aug post-summer decline confirmed. Lost/delayed shipments pattern update: P26 order (1091u) overdue past expected P28 conclude (arrived=0); total ~3785u in-transit unreliable sustained 13+ orders.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02, Labor Day): swimwear end-of-season, post-summer decline regime at P25 sustained 5 periods (P25-29 demands:383,245,180,137,133; avg=216 -49% from prior peak 527, std~104 low vol confirmed by trend continuation P29=133). On-hand=685 sufficient for 4-5 low-demand periods (~150-200). In-transit=3785 unreliable (overdue incl. new P27=752u past expected P29 arrived=0, plus prior P26=1091u etc.; no arrivals P28-29). Recent LTs stable (last 5 obs: P27 LT2,P26 LT3,P19 LT1,P17 LT2,P14 LT2 avg=2.0). Set recent_N N=5 across params to capture low-demand regime (mu_hat~(1+2)*216=648, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*104=180; base_stock~648+0.84*180~800 <4470 pipeline \u2192 order=0, prioritizes avoiding excess holding on high on-hand amid unreliable pipeline/losses).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 25: avg P25-P29=216 (std~104, -49% from P16-P24=527), sustained 5 periods; swimwear early-Sep end-of-season decline confirmed.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9): Early September, post-Labor Day, swimwear end-of-season with sharp demand decline confirmed (P30=67 lowest, avg P25-P30=191, -49% from summer peak 527). On-hand=1370 high, in-transit=3033 unreliable (older orders like P26=1091u overdue >LT3 expected P29, no P28-P29 arrivals but P30 partial 752u from P27 LT3). Pipeline total ~4403 covers many low-demand periods. Reconcile: recent LTs LT=3(P27@P30),2(P25@P27),3(P23@P26) avg=2.67>promised 2, delays/lost sustained. Use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=6 at P25 changepoint, avg demand=191 std=111 evidenced by 6 periods declining 383\u219267). recent_N N=3 for L (last 3 LT obs avg=2.67) to adjust backend for longer actual LT/unreliability, raising base_stock~(1+2.67)*191 + z* sqrt(1+2.67)*111 ~725 +0.84*170~870; but pipeline>>base_stock ensures order~0, minimizing holding on excess inv while buffering service if demand surprises.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 25: avg P25-P30=191 (std=111, -49% from P16-P24=527), sustained 6 periods; swimwear early-Sep end-of-season sharp decline confirmed (P30=67). Recent LT avg 2.67 (last 3 obs P26/P27/P30 concludes: LT3,2,3), delays increasing. Lost/delayed shipments pattern update: P26 order (1091u) overdue past expected P29 LT3 (no arrive P28-P30 for it); in-transit=3033u remains high post partial arrivals, unreliable sustained 15+ orders.

High on-hand=1301 incurs holding costs amid low demand; in-transit=3033 unreliable (many lost e.g. P26=1091u still missing >4pd overdue, no arrival P31). No recent orders to track new overdues. Chgpoint evidence: low demand sustained 7pd from P25 regime (length=7, N=7); recent LTs LT=3(P26),2(P27),3(P30) avg=2.67 (last 3 obs). Set L recent_3 for delay-aware planning; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 for current low regime (backend mu~(1+2.67)*173~636, sigma~sqrt(3.67)*102~196, base_stock~636+0.84*196~812 << pipeline~4334 \u2192 order=0 optimal, drains excess inv w/o overorder risk despite unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 25: avg P25-P31=173 (std=102, -49% from summer P16-P24=527), sustained 7 periods with recent P28-P31 subregime avg=101.5 (std=34 low vol, -25% from P25-P27=269); swimwear mid-Sep end-of-season low demand low volatility confirmed.

High on-hand=1214 covers many low-demand periods; in-transit=3033 unreliable (no arrivals P31-P33=0, stable high post partials, many overdue e.g. P26/P27/P30 orders unresolved, total lost pattern 17+ orders). Recent LTs last 3 observed (P26 conclude LT3 for P23, P27 LT2 for P25, P30 LT3 for P27): avg=2.67, delays persisting vs promised 2. Use L recent_N N=3 for accurate ~2.67.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Late October, swimwear fully off-season post-summer peak; demand regime since P30 sustained low near-zero low vol (P30-P37 demands:67,69,45,42,71,40,34,21 avg=48.6 std~18). On-hand=1048 high from prior arrivals + low sales; in-transit=3033 unreliable (no arrivals P31-P37=7 periods, many overdue e.g. P26=1091u past LT3, total lost sustained). Pipeline covers far beyond low demand outlook, expect order~0. Use recent_N N=3 for L (last obs LT P26=3,P27=2,P30=3 avg=2.67) to reflect persisting delays >promised 2. recent_N N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime length=8 P30-P37) for (1+L)*low mean/vol forecast, low base_stock prevents overorder amid unreliable pipeline/high holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 30: avg P30-P37=48.6 (std~18 low vol), sustained 8 periods; swimwear late-Oct end-of-season near-zero low vol confirmed. Lost/delayed shipments pattern update: No arrivals P31-P37 (7 periods arrived=0 extending prior); in-transit=3033u stable high, unreliable sustained 20+ orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4): Swimwear deep off-season early November, post-summer decline; demand regime low since changepoint P30 (avg P30-P38=47.1 std~18 low vol, sustained 9 periods, fits end-of-season near-zero). On-hand=1013 covers ~20+ periods at 47/unit; in-transit=3033 unreliable (no arrivals P31-P38=8 periods arrived=0, many overdue/lost per history). Recent LT last 3 obs (P26:3 P23-order, P27:2 P25, P30:3 P27)=avg 2.67, delays persisting. Use recent_N N=3 for L (covers recent avg~2.67); recent_N N=9 mu_hat/sigma_hat (low current regime mean/vol, backend mu=(1+L)*47.1~173, sigma~sqrt(1+L)*18~23 low). Low base_stock ~200 vs position>4000 ensures order~0, minimizes holding cost on high on-hand during low demand, avoids over-reliance on unreliable pipeline.

On-hand=978 covers ~21 periods demand; in-transit=3033 unreliable (no arrivals P31-P39=9 periods arrived=0, stable high post partials, pattern sustained 22+ orders). Recent LT last 3 obs (P26:3,P27:2,P30:3) avg=2.67 persisting delays. High pipeline=4011 >> base_stock; parameters use recent_10 mu/sigma capture low regime/demand/vol for low base_stock (q=0.8 z~0.84, mu_hat~(1+2.67)*45.9~123, sigma_hat~sqrt(3.67)*17~33, base_stock~123+0.84*33~151 <<4011) ensures order~0 minimizing holding costs amid unreliable pipeline; recent_3 L bridges LT variability without overbuffering losses.

On-hand=930 high (covers >20 periods demand), in-transit=3033 unreliable (no arrivals P31-P40=10 periods arrived=0, many overdue/lost per history totaling thousands). No recent LT observations beyond P30 (LT=3 for P27 order); last 3 LTs (P26:3,P27:2,P30:3) avg=2.67. Use recent_N N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low regime (mu_hat\u2248(1+2.67)*46.1\u2248138, sigma_hat\u2248sqrt(3.67)*17\u224833); recent_N N=3 for L=2.67.

LLM Rationale:

Demand regime stable near-zero low vol since changepoint P30 (avg P30-P42=46.7 over 13 periods, std~18, e.g., demands 67,69,45,...,75), sustained 13 periods; P42=75 slight uptick within vol (not sustained shift, no Dec swimwear catalyst). On-hand=830 + in-transit=3033 (unreliable per history, no arrivals P31-P42=12 periods arrived=0, extending pattern). Pipeline=3863 >> low demand needs (~47*20=940). No new LT obs (last: P30 LT3, P27 LT2, P26 LT3). Set L recent_N N=3 (avg LT=2.67 recent delays); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=13 (regime_length=13, max(min(13,20),3)=13).

On-hand=793 ample (covers ~17 periods at avg46), in-transit=3033 unreliable (no arrivals P31-P43=13 zeros, many overdue/lost per carry-over). Reconcile: massive phantom pipeline overestimates protection; flag sustained losses. No new LT obs (last P30 LT=3). Set L recent_N N=3 (last obs P26:3,P27:2,P30:3 avg=2.67) for slight delay buffer. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=14 for low recent regime (backend: ~46*(1+~2.67)=~184 mean, low std scaled). Low base_stock << pipeline=3826 ensures order~0, avoids adding inventory, prioritizes holding cost reduction while covering minimal demand service.

On-hand=758 sufficient for ~17 periods at recent demand levels (P40-P44 avg~44); in-transit=3033 unreliable/likely lost (no arrivals P31-P44=14 periods, extending pattern of 26+ unreliable orders). Recent LTs (last 3 observed: P26 LT3, P27 LT2, P30 LT3; avg 2.67) used for L to adjust for delays. recent_N N=15 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures sustained post-summer decline (P30-P44), yielding low mu_hat~(1+2.67)*45~165, low sigma_hat~sqrt(3.67)*18~34; base_stock~165 + 0.84*34~193 << pipeline=3791, ensures order~0 to minimize holding costs on excess inventory while service level high due to on-hand buffer.

On-hand=726 covers ~18+ periods at 40/period; in-transit=3033 unreliable/lost (no arrivals P31-P45=15 periods extending prior pattern, stable ghost inventory). No new orders needed to avoid holding costs ($1/unit/period) given ample actual supply & low demand. L=recent_N N=3 (last obs P26 LT3/P27 LT2/P30 LT3 avg=2.67, delays persisting); mu_hat=recent_N N=16 (regime_length=16 since P30 changepoint, (1+~2.67)*44.4~133 low); sigma_hat=recent_N N=16 (low vol captures current stability). Low base_stock (~133+0.84*sqrt(3.67)*17~133+25=158) << pipeline 3759 ensures order=0, optimal balance vs holding.

Period 47 (2019/12/30): Late December, post-Christmas/New Year's, swimwear demand near-zero (P46=15, recent avg P44-P46=27.3); end-of-season winter regime since P30 changepoint (avg P30-P46=42.7 std~20 low vol, sustained 17 periods confirmed by carry-over). On-hand=711 covers residual demand for many periods; in-transit=3033 stuck/unreliable (no arrivals P31-P46=16 periods). Recent LT observations stable (last 3: P26 LT=3, P27 LT=2, P30 LT=3, avg=2.67). Use recent_N N=3 for L to reflect persistent delays; recent_N N=17 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low-demand low-vol regime (mu_hat~(1+2.67)*42.7~130, sigma_hat~sqrt(3.67)*20~38, base_stock~130+0.84*38~160 <<3744 pipeline). Ensures OR backend orders ~0, avoids adding to high holding costs while covering tiny demand; ignores unreliable pipeline losses.

Carry-over insight: Lost/delayed shipments pattern update: No arrivals P31-P46 (16 periods arrived=0 extending prior); in-transit=3033u stable high, unreliable sustained 28+ orders.
