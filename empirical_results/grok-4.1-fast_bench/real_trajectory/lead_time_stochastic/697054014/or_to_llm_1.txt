Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised L=2, but carry-over confirms sustained loss pattern with massive ghost in-transit (2205 units, up from 2105 at P45, likely including P46's 250 order which arrived=0 in P46 conclude); recent arrivals sporadic (e.g., P45 had some, P46 none), many orders lost 3+ periods past L=2. Treat effective pipeline as 0 despite reported 2205. Inventory: On-hand 310 (from P46 ending), ample coverage. Demand analysis: Recent P43-P46 (Dec): 93,116,98,93 avg~100; broader P41-P46 avg~108; fall uptrend (P30-P39 avg133) softened post-Thanksgiving/Christmas (P42 spike 178, then stabilization ~100); date 2019/12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's Eve, everyday blouse demand likely moderate (no major spike expected for casual garment). Forecast: ~100-110/period. Coverage: 310 covers 3+ periods (L+1=3, 300-330 needed). OR rec=0 based on illusory high pipeline + historical mean; we agree/override implicitly by following, as adding to ghost pile wasteful (holding $1 vs profit $19, but stockout risk low). Strategy: Order 0 to leverage on-hand, minimize holding exposure and ghost accumulation; monitor P47 demand for recovery confirmation.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - on-hand 310 covers 3+ periods of recent demand avg ~100, avoiding addition to 2205 ghost in-transit amid sustained supplier loss pattern.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-Christmas demand stabilization: P43-P46 avg 100 (-25% from fall P30-P39 avg 133), sustained 4 periods; ghost inventory updated to 2205 units (P46 conclude arrived=0, +100 since P45 insight at 2105), loss pattern continues",
