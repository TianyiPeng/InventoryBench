======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2; recent arrivals show variability (e.g., LT=1,2,3 observed previously), but P46 conclude arrived=0 confirms P44 order of 100 (placed P44, expected P46 LT=2) lost, continuing high loss pattern. Inventory position: On-hand=94; in-transit=1987 bloated by ~1987 confirmed lost units (per carry-over + new P44 loss), effective reliable pipeline ~0. Demand analysis: Recent P43-P46 demands 64,80,104,58 (avg 77); post-holiday softening after P42=207 spike and P44-P45 highs (holiday upshift per carry-over), P46=58 low aligns with winter downshift trend (P36-P41 avg 53); date 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas, New Year's Eve) suggests continued moderate ~70-80 for men's t-shirt/underwear, no major spike expected. OR recommendation: 0 units, based on promised LT=2 and full history (diluted by early lows), overestimates coverage due to ignoring massive lost shipments in pipeline. Strategy: Override OR to order 100 - targets base-stock ~230 (3-period coverage at avg 77, LT+1) minus on-hand 94, conservative adjustment for unreliable arrivals/loss risk and demand softening, minimizing holding while preventing stockouts (19 profit/unit vs 1 holding).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 100 units - in-transit 1987 bloated by confirmed lost shipments (now incl. P44's 100), effective pipeline ~0; on-hand 94 covers P47 (~77 expected) but needs replenishment for LT=2 amid post-holiday demand avg 77.",
  "carry_over_insight": "P44 order 100 lost confirmed (no P46 arrival, overdue past LT=2); total confirmed lost now 1987 units bloating in-transit.",
