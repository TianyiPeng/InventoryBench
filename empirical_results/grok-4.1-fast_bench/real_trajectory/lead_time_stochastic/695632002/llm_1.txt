Summer low retired, fall rebound evolved to holiday peak. (c) Lead time/Missing: Recent LT=2 reconfirmed (P41->P43); variability sustained (1-3); no new losses (P42 order 300 overdue LT=3 expect P45, P43=500 LT=2 expect P45, P44=500 LT=1-2 expect P45-46); prior losses ended. (d) Inventory/Pipeline: On-hand=0 (P44 stockout on 131 demand); in-transit=3780 (~9-12 periods at 300-400 demand, heavy coverage); expect P45 arrivals ~800+ (P42 300 LT3 + P43 500 LT2 + poss P44 LT1), buffers P45-47 despite LT risk.

{
  "rationale": "(a) Product: Long-sleeve blouse (Gyda), winter-appropriate garment upper body/womens tailoring. Date 2019/12/23 (Mon before Christmas Day 12/25): peak holiday gift-shopping week, expect demand spike for clothing gifts similar to Black Friday P42=862 or sustained highs; post-Cyber Monday (P43) dip in P44-P45 but Christmas anticipation drives rebound. (b) Demand regime: Holiday high sustained P42-P45 avg406 (+122% vs fall avg183), volatile (862 spike, then 227\u2192131\u2192157); Christmas week likely 300-500+ demand, conservative forecast 350 avg recent non-spike holiday. Historical Jan-Feb avg~130 low post-holiday. (c) Lead time: Recent reconfirmed LT=2-3 (P42\u2192P45 LT=3; P43\u2192P45 LT=2; no losses recent P42-P45); no new overdues confirmed (P44 order 500 expected P46 LT=2; P45 500 expected P47 LT=2); early losses ended per prior insights. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 643 (covers ~2 periods at 350 demand); massive in-transit 3480 (likely includes P44 500 arriving P46, P45 500 P47, plus backlog; total coverage 4123 units ~12+ periods); post-P45 arrivals boosted to 643 end despite 157 demand. (e) Final order logic: Maintain holiday coverage matching recent 500 orders amid volatile highs/Christmas peak risk; pipeline ample but LT variability/loss history warrants proactive replenishment to buffer 2-3 periods ahead (P48-P49) vs post-holiday drop; balances stockout risk (profit 19>>holding 1).",

(b) Demand regime: Holiday high volatile post-spike (P42-P46: 862\u2192227\u2192131\u2192157\u219283); recent P44-P46 avg123 (-25% vs fall high~183); softening trend but not fully sustained downward shift yet (short 3 periods, avg still ~150 incl P43); forecast P47 ~100-150 conservative post-Christmas drop toward winter baseline~130. (c) Lead time/missing orders: LT variability 1-3 sustained; recent reliable (P42 LT3/P45, P43 LT2/P45, P41 LT2/P43); no arrivals P46 so P44 order (500, placed P44) overdue past LT=2 (potential LT=3 arrival P47 or lost); P45 order (500) due P47 LT=2; P46 order (500) due P48 LT=2; no new losses confirmed recently.
