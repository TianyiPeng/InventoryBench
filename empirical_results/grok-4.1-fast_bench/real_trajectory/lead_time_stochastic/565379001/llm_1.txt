Intermittent losses pre-P23 per carry-over. (d) Inventory: on-hand 141 (from P23 arrivals depleting slowly at ~6/wk); covers 20+ periods of trough demand; pipeline 2800 ghost (ignore for planning). (e) Order 0: 141 covers endgame (3 periods left /47), low demand (forecast 5-10/wk), minimizes holding ($1/u/p) on excess vs $19 profit; no reliable supplier, avoid adding to ghost risk. Monitor for holiday spike next periods.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) Product: Women's everyday basic fitted vest top in stretch cotton jersey (Moa tank, upper body garment). Suitable for layering or warm weather, not a typical Christmas gift item (e.g., no holiday theme). Date 2019/12/23: Christmas Eve week (Dec 25 Wed), peak last-minute shopping, but basics like jersey tanks unlikely to spike significantly vs. gifts/apparel specials; historical winter trough dominates. (b) Demand regime: Deep winter trough sustained P36-P44 avg~6 (9 periods), P45=23 (12/16) slight uptick but single period amid lows (P43-44=2,2; P42=13 Thanksgiving), not sustained shift (needs 3+ periods). Overall decline from spring ~220 to winter ~6 (-97%). Forecast P46: 20-30 holiday blip max, then revert to ~5-10. (c) Lead time/missing: No orders since P22 (arrived P23), no arrivals since; in-transit 2800 confirmed permanent ghost (12+ periods no activity). Supplier losses intermittent (e.g., P17, P10, P13 lost); actual LT 1-2 when delivers, but avoid risking new ghosts. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 118 (end P45) covers 4-5 periods at 25 demand or 10+ at trough ~10; ghost pipeline unreliable, ignore for planning. No expected arrivals. (e) Order logic: Ample buffer vs. low forecasted demand & blip; holding $1 cheap vs. $19 lost sale, but no stockout risk & unreliable supplier justify 0 order to minimize ghosts/avoid unnecessary pipeline bloat.",

  "rationale": "(a) Product: Women's everyday basic fitted tank/vest top (stretch cotton jersey).

Current 2019/12/30: post-Christmas/New Year's Eve; no demand boost expected for basics post-holidays (carry-over notes no Xmas spike). Forecast P47 demand: 5-10, aligned with trough regime. (b) Demand regime: Deep winter trough sustained P36-P46 avg ~7 (2,2,23,12 recent; P45 holiday outlier not sustained, P46 drop to 12 confirms low). No regime shift vs P45 insight (P36-P44 avg6). (c) Lead time/missing: No orders since P22 (Jul 2019), no arrivals since; in-transit 2800 ghost permanent (12+ periods overdue, carry-over P35/32). Supplier unreliable/intermittent losses; no new LT data. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 106 (from prior accumulations), real pipeline=0. Covers 10-20 periods trough demand; holding cost pressure but service level high. (e) Order logic: Order 0. Ample stock, unreliable supplier (risk lost order adds ghost), minimize holding vs low demand; preserve buffer for trough.",
