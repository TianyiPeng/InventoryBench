Demand analysis: Winter low regime for short-sleeved t-shirts sustained (P36-P43 avg~17, P46=19); holiday uptick P44-P45 avg27 (+69% pre-Christmas), but P46 softening to 19 (-30%), post-Christmas/New Year's Eve expect ~18-22 baseline drop. OR recommendation: 0 units, valid under its assumptions (high ghost pipeline, all-history low mean), but ignores ghosts/losses and immediate stockout risk. Strategy: Override to conservative 30u - covers ~1.5x expected P47 demand (20) + safety for LT uncertainty/stockout (q=19/20=0.95 fractile), avoids overordering into low-demand winter while rebuilding effective pipeline amid unreliability; prioritizes sales (19p/unit) over holding (1p).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 30 units - on-hand 0 and effective pipeline only ~80 unreliable recent orders; recent demand softening to winter low ~20 post-holiday (P46=19), but stockout risk high with profit=19 vs unreliable supply.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Supply disruption critically extended: no arrivals P36-P46 (11 consecutive periods), P44 order (40u) overdue past LT2; Demand post-holiday softening confirmed: P46=19 (-30% vs P44-P45 avg27), returning to winter low regime ~18 over 3 recent periods.",
