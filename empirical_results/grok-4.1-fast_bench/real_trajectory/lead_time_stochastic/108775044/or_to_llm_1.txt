Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Step 1: Lead-time inference - Recent confirmed LT: P31 order arrived P32 (LT=1). Historical LT variability 1-2 periods, but many losses (e.g., P17-P19, P13-P14 lost). No new arrivals in P46 conclude. In-transit 1536 units likely accumulated ghosts from lost orders (historical losses: P1=166, P3=220, P10=50, P13=350, P14=250, P16=350, P17=350, P19=150, etc., totaling far over 386 noted earlier). Promised LT=2, but unreliable with high loss rate. Step 2: Inventory & pipeline - On-hand=0. Massive in-transit=1536 dwarfs tiny demand (~5-6 avg recent), but ghosts don't arrive, so effective pipeline unreliable. Recent ending inventories ran to 0 without stockouts causing major loss (low demand). Step 3: Demand analysis - Strap tops (summer wear) in deep winter trough confirmed 24+ periods (P22-P45 avg ~5, P40-P46: 4,3,10,2,4,7,11 avg=5.7, -96% vs hist 134, -98% vs spring 252). Date 2019/12/30 (late Dec, pre-NY): No seasonal boost expected for strap tops (post-Christmas lull, winter decline sustained). Historical early-year (Jan) was ~134 avg, but post-summer crash persists. No rebound signal. Step 4: OR recommendation - 0 units, using promised LT=2 and all-history demand (ignores regime shift to trough). Aligns perfectly with reality: low demand forecast \u03bc\u0302 low, base-stock near pipeline. Step 5: Strategy - Follow OR 0: No order needed. Tiny demand covered by any actual arrivals; avoid adding to ghost in-transit/holding risk. Profit-holding balanced at low volume. (L+1=3 periods coverage ample with pipeline.)",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - demand in deep winter trough for strap tops sustained P40-P46 avg 5.7 (-96% vs hist 134), no rebound into late Dec/NY; massive 1536 in-transit ghosts cover minimal needs without new orders risking losses/holding.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand trough persists late Dec P40-P46 avg 5.7 (-96% vs hist 134, -98% vs spring 252), extending 25+ periods (P22-P46) confirming deep winter decline for strap tops",
