No seasonal demand drivers like holidays; expect continued ultra-low demand as strap tops unsuited for cold weather. Historical pre-summer highs irrelevant; post-P17 summer decline sustained. (b) Demand regime: sustained ultra-low since P18 (summer end), P38-46 avg ~5.9 (8,4,4,3,10,2,4,7,11; 9 periods, all <=11, no Christmas/New Year's uptick despite P42=10/P46=11 outliers). Confirms ongoing post-summer decline vs high P10-17 ~240 (-98%). (c) Lead time/missing orders: Promised LT=2 unreliable; sustained losses since P20 (no arrivals P20-46, 27 periods straight despite prior orders); 1834 units in-transit confirmed indefinitely lost per history/insights (e.g., P19(220) etc. overdue 20+ periods). No recent arrivals to infer LT pattern. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=115 (covers ~20+ periods at ~5-6/wk); in-transit=1834 lost (ignore for planning). Ending inv P46=115 after demand=11, no stockouts but high holding exposure. (e) Order 0: Ample on-hand for ultra-low demand; unreliable supplier (sustained total losses) risks adding to lost pipeline; profit=holding=1 means deplete existing stock slowly to minimize net loss while avoiding pointless orders/stockouts irrelevant at low demand.",
