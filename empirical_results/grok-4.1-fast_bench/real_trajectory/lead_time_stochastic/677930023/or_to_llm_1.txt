{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variable (LT=3 for P40->P43, LT=2 for P39->P41; prior sustained LT=3 per P37 insight), promised=2; no new concludes in P44 (arrived=0), monitor ongoing in-transit=1141 for LT~2-3 arrivals in P45-P47. No new lost shipments confirmed (e.g., recent orders like P43's 250 overdue? Pending P45+). Inventory analysis: On-hand=450 (post-P44 demand=49), covers ~9 periods at recent avg 50 demand; total pipeline (450+1141=1591) vastly exceeds needs even for surge (e.g., prior peaks ~200-350 covered multiple periods). Demand analysis: P39-44 stable low avg 50 units (50,51,47,74,29,49), extending P39-43 insight with no Christmas surge yet (P44=49); Dec16 (P45) pre-Christmas, but Black Friday P43=29 showed no holiday lift unlike Labor Day; expect modest winter demand ~50-100, not justifying more orders near game end (47 periods). OR recommendation=0 aligns with base-stock (high pipeline exceeds base_stock given low mu_hat); no override needed as excess ordering risks high end-game holding costs ($1/unit/period).

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals show variability (e.g., P43 order LT=2 arrived P45; prior P40 LT=3 P43, P32 LT=3 P35, P36 LT=3 P39), with sustained LT=3 pattern earlier but recent LT=2; promised=2, losses sporadic (e.g., P34 lost); no new overdue visible yet for very recent orders (P44/P45 ordered 0). In-transit=891 units total (ETAs inferred as mix LT=2-3, covering next 2-4 periods). Inventory analysis: On-hand=663 + in-transit=891 = total pipeline=1554 units; recent demand P39-45 avg=48 units (50,51,47,74,29,49,37), so covers ~32 periods even at current rate; holding cost $1 vs profit $4 favors not overstocking further. Demand analysis: Stable low post-Thanksgiving/early Dec confirmed (carry-over P39-43 avg50, extended P39-45 avg48 with no Black Friday surge P43=29 or Christmas buildup P44=49/P45=37); Date=2019/12/23 (Christmas Dec25 in P46 week) could spike sweater demand (winter garment), but no evidence from recent holidays (Labor Day surged but Black Friday/Thanksgiving did not for this SKU), and no pre-holiday acceleration in P43-45. OR recommendation: 0 units (appropriate given high pipeline, low historical mean used by OR); no override needed as position ample for LT+1=3-4 periods demand (~150-200 even if moderate holiday lift).
