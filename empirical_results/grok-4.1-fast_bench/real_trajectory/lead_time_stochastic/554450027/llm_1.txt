Christmas build-up likely starts P44+ (historical Jan ~130 avg aligns holiday highs); volatile but upward bias vs summer lows. Forecast P44 ~120-150, risk 200+ spike. (c) Lead-time/missing: LT variable (recent: LT3 P40->P43/P36->P39; LT2 P41->P43/P39->P41; LT1 sporadic); LT=3 semi-sustained but not fully (mixed 2-3). High loss risk (in-transit 1950 ~lost total 1890+ prior, stable despite orders); recent arrivals reliable (P43:280 arrived from P40/41, P42:0 no overdue flag yet). No new losses confirmed P43; P42 order(160) expected P44-45 (LT2-3); monitor. (d) Inv&pipeline: On-hand 208 (~1-2 periods cover at 120-150); in-transit 1950 massive (covers 10-15+ periods if arrives, but ~high loss risk means effective ~50-70% yield? Recent arrivals suggest improving); P43 arrivals boosted to 208 end. Pipeline strong short-term (P42/43 orders 160+220=380 expected soon LT2-3), but loss risk warrants buffer orders. (e) Order logic: Balance stockout risk (P42 lost ~178 sales=$712 profit) vs holding ($1/unit); holiday spike potential prioritizes service. Order 200: covers ~1.5 periods demand + safety for LT3 + loss buffer; replenishes if pipeline underperforms, limits excess given 208+1950 pipeline.",
