(c) Lead time: Variability 1-3 sustained (carry-over, e.g., P39\u2192P41 LT2, P32\u2192P35 LT3); P42 arrived=0 as expected (P40/P41/P42 orders=0, no overdue); no new losses (prior broken at P32-33). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=657 (post-P42, covers 3-4 periods at 150-200 forecast or 10+ at low 50); in-transit=3570 massive (covers years, recent LT1-3 implies waves arriving P43-P46); no stockouts recent, high ending inv risks holding costs. (e) Order logic: Zero order preserves pipeline coverage for holiday ramp (657+3570 >> multi-period needs), avoids excess buildup amid $1 holding vs $19 profit; monitor P43-45 demand/arrivals for spike confirmation before reordering.",
