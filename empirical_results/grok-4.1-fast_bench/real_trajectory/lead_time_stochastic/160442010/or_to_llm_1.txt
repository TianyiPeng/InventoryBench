======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas period for sneaker socks (women's hidden socks); no New Year's demand driver expected, aligning with sustained late-Dec low demand (P43-46 avg 24, no rebound from fall avg 52). On-hand=249 covers ~10 periods at 25 demand; massive in-transit=2689 (includes P44 order 300 overdue 1 period past LT=2 expected P46 arrival, plus P45=200 pending LT~2 arrive P47, and older pipeline) provides buffer even with ~30-50% historical sporadic loss rate (total lost ~2189 prior). Recent LT variable (P42 LT3, P43 LT2); promised LT=2 used by OR. Demand history: early high (P1-3 avg~175), summer drop to 140 (-48%), fall/Dec deepen to 50 then 24 (-54%). OR recommends 0 using historical mean/variance over promised LT=2, ignoring losses/pipeline/low regime - fully aligns with reality of excess coverage vs low outlook. Order 0 to minimize holding costs on excess inv/pipeline.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - on-hand 249 + pipeline 2689 covers dozens of low-demand periods (~24 avg P43-46 late Dec), no post-Christmas rebound for sneaker socks, avoids adding to high-risk pipeline amid sporadic losses.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Late December demand low sustained P43-46 avg 24 (-54% vs fall P37-41 avg 52), no Christmas rebound confirmed through 12/23; P44 order (300 units) overdue 1 period past LT=2 (no P46 arrival), emerging risk in sporadic loss pattern.",
