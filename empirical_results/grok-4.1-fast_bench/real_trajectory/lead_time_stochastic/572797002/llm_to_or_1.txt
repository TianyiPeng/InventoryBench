Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), first decision, no prior game history or conclude messages. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demands (5 samples Jan-Feb 2019): mean~80.8, no changepoints or seasonal shifts evident (stable 64-95). Near Valentine's Day (Feb 14), but no prior spike evidence for this women's casual tank top (potentially light/spring item). Promised L=2. Use defaults: backend computes mu_hat=(1+2)*mean_all~242, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*std_all. Ensures coverage for 3 periods demand while balancing profit=holding=$1 (q=0.5, moderate base stock). No overdue shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18), late winter for women's casual fitted vest top (tank top with lace). No major calendar events nearby (post-Valentine's Day 2/14, demand P1=105 possibly influenced but higher than historical mean ~80.8 across 5 samples up to 2019-02-04:64; std~12.5). Single high demand observation, not sustained (needs 3+ periods), no changepoint. No concluded arrivals yet, Period 1 order (104) in-transit as expected (promised LT=2, arrives during P3). On-hand=0 after P1 demand=105>sold=0. Pipeline covers ~1 recent demand period. Defaults set L=2 (promised), mu_hat=(1+2)*~80.8=~242, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*~12.5~22; OR orders ~min(242-104, cap) to target base stock at q=0.5 median, balancing profit/holding with safety for LT+1=3 periods demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25), women's casual tank top (fitted jersey vest with lace). Late winter/off-season for tank tops, no major holidays; demands spiked to 105 (P1, +30% vs hist ~81), 163 (P2, +100%), indicating potential regime shift. On-hand=0, pipeline=216 (P1 order 104 expected P3 arrival, P2 112 expected P4); no arrivals yet as expected with L=2 (none overdue). Continued stockouts. No concluded lead times observed. Use default L (promised 2). recent_N=2 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent high mean/vol (134 mean, ~58 std), yielding ~402 mu_hat, ~100 sigma_hat; base_stock~402 (z=0), order~186 (after 216 pipeline) to aggressively cover rising demand while cap limits excess. Addresses stockouts by inflating forecast vs default (~288 mu_hat).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4): Women's casual tank top; early March, potential spring demand uptick. Demand changepoint: historical mean (5 samples to 2019-02-04) = 80.8, recent Periods 1-3: 105/163/162 mean=143.3 (+77%), sustained 3 periods, likely seasonal shift to warmer weather apparel. No arrivals in P1-P3 concludes despite P1 order expected in P3 (promised LT=2), suggesting delay/loss but single instance\u2014not prolonged, so no LT adjustment yet. On-hand=0, in-transit=402 (P1+P2+P3 orders). Use recent_3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high-demand regime: backend computes mu_hat=(1+2)*143.3\u2248430, sigma_hat=\u221a3*29.4\u224851, raising base_stock to cover elevated demand over LT+1=3 periods while q=0.5 balances stockout vs holding. Default L=2 (no observed LTs for average). Parameters ensure OR orders to replenish pipeline gaps proactively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1: avg increased from 80.8 (pre-P1 samples) to 143 (+77%) sustained over Periods 1-3 (105,163,162)

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), early spring; tank top (women's casual jersey vest) demand likely ramping seasonally. High demand regime sustained P1-4 (105,163,162,207; mean=159.25, +97% vs historical ~81; std~41.8 sample). Confirmed shift from carry-over. Period 1 order (104u) lost (promised arrive P3, absent in P3/P4 concludes). Only one LT obs: P2 order arrived P4 (LT=2). Pipeline=318 (~2x recent demand). On-hand=0. Set L='calculate' (avg obs LT=2). mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=4 for high regime (backend: mu_hat=3*159.25\u2248477; covers ~3 periods). z*=0 so base_stock\u2248477, order\u2248477-318=159 to replenish; sigma for cap. Addresses lost by recent high mu_hat ensuring coverage despite pipeline unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (104 units) lost: no arrival by Period 4 conclude (expected during P3 for LT=2); Demand high regime sustained P1-4 avg 159 (+97% vs historical 80.8)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18, early spring). Tank top (women's casual jersey vest) demand: historical Jan-Feb avg ~81 (samples 92,68,85,95,64); recent P1-5: 105,163,162,207,105 avg 148 (+83% shift confirmed prior). P5=105 drop after P4=207 peak, but high regime sustained (5 periods > historical). LT: only P2 order LT=2 observed; P1 lost (no P3 arrive); P3=186 overdue (exp P5 LT=2, arrived=0 in P5 conclude) - possible LT=3 or lost, but insufficient data for change. On-hand=0, in-transit=478 (covers ~3 periods at recent avg). Expected P6 arrivals post-decision: P4=28 (LT=2), poss P3=186 (if LT=3). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high mean/variance regime (N=5=regime length since P1); L=default (promised 2, single confirm). Ensures base_stock covers ~3*148=444 demand + safety, balancing profit=1 vs holding=1; high pipeline tempers overorder.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), early spring; women's tank top likely seeing sustained demand increase due to seasonal warming (historical winter avg ~81, current P1-6 avg 155 +92%). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (P1:104 lost, P3:186 overdue past LT=2 expected P5 arrival/no show in P6 conclude, P4:28 overdue past P6 arrival/no show). High demand regime since P1 changepoint confirmed over 6 periods (105,163,162,207,105,190). Pipeline overstated due to losses/delays; default L=2 (promised), mu_hat recent_N=6 uses (1+2)*155.3\u2248466 base stock \u2192 order \u2248466-318=148 to cover ~1pd demand despite risks. Sigma recent_6 captures elevated vol ~38 vs hist ~12. Ensures backend orders despite inflated pipeline, balancing service (high sales) vs holding (ending inv low historically).

Carry-over insight: Demand high regime sustained P1-6 avg155 (+92% vs hist 80.8); LT variation: P2 order LT=2, P5 LT=1; Delayed shipments P3 (186u) & P4 (28u) not arrived past expected LT=2 (P6 conclude)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1, early spring): Tank top product aligns with seasonal demand increase as weather warms; high demand regime sustained P1-7 (demands:105,163,162,207,105,190,210; avg=163, +102% vs hist 80.8). Pipeline=466: P1(104 overdue since exp P3/LT2, no by P4), P3(186 overdue since P5), P4(28 overdue since P6), P7(148 recent); on-hand=0 risks stockout. Observed LTs: P2 order LT=2, P5 LT=1 (avg=1.5); delays indicate unreliability but only 2 concluded--use 'calculate' for L to avg observed. High regime changepoint P1 sustained 7+ periods (N=7>=3), so 'recent_N' N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to forecast ~163 mean/high vol across (1+L), raising base_stock vs default (hist low); avg LT lowers vs promised 2 to reflect faster arrivals when they happen, balancing service vs holding despite OR unawareness of specific delays/lost.

Carry-over insight: Delayed shipments sustained through P7 conclude: P1(104u overdue ~4pd), P3(186u ~3pd), P4(28u ~2pd) past LT=2 expectation; no new arrivals confirming LT drift/loss pattern

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring, women's tank top demand rising seasonally as weather warms toward summer; high demand regime sustained P1-8 avg170 (+110% vs pre-game hist ~81), with recent acceleration P6-8:190/210/220 avg207 (+39% vs P1-5 avg148), changepoint at P6 (post-P5 dip), regime_length=3 \u2192 N=3. Pipeline 342u = overdue/likely lost P1(104),P3(186),P4(28) + recent P8(24); confirmed arrivals LT: P2:2 (1st obs), P5:1,P7:1 \u2192 LT changepoint post-1st obs to short LT=1 regime_length=2 \u2192 recent_N N=2 avg L=1. But use recent_N N=3 incl all obs for L avg~1.33 to slightly conservatize. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=3 captures escalating mean~207/vol low~15, (1+1.33)*207~482 base_stock target >>342 pipeline (partial arrival expected) \u2192 orders extra to cover high demand/service lost sales despite stuck pipeline, z=0 so base=mu_hat balances profit/holding at q=0.5.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration at P6 confirmed: P6-8 avg207 (+39% vs P1-5 avg148) sustained 3 periods; LT short regime LT=1 sustained (P5 & P7 orders post-P2 LT=2); Delayed/lost shipments sustained P1(104u overdue~7pd), P3(186u ~5pd), P4(28u ~4pd) no arrival by P8 conclude

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15, mid-spring): Women's casual tank top aligns with seasonal demand rise as weather warms; Easter (4/21) nearby may boost casual wear. Demands high since P1 (avg ~170 P1-9), acceleration changepoint P6 confirmed sustained P6-9 (190,210,220,188; avg 202, +36% vs P1-5 avg148; regime length=4pd, N=4). On-hand=0; in-transit=574 overstated by likely lost P1(104 overdue ~8pd, exp P3), P3(186 ~6pd, exp P5), P4(28 ~5pd, exp P6) total~318 lost; real pipeline ~256 (P8=24 exp P10 LT2, P9=232 pending). P9 arrived=0 confirms P8 order LT\u22601 (not arr P9), likely LT=2. Observed LTs: P2=2, P5=1, P7=1. L=default (promised 2, conservative amid variation/losses to inflate (1+L)=3 for coverage). mu_hat=recent_N N=4 (backend: 3*202=606 base >574 pipeline, triggers order despite fake pipeline; balances high demand/service vs hold). sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 (low recent vol ~16, tightens cap minimally since z=0).

Carry-over insight: LT short regime (LT=1) broken: P8 order (24u) not arrived P9 conclude (expected if LT=1), likely LT=2; delayed/lost shipments persist P1(104u overdue~8pd), P3(186u ~6pd), P4(28u ~5pd)

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), spring season for women's lace tank top (upper body casual jersey vest); demand likely sustained high into warmer weather. Recent demands P6-10: 190,210,220,188,208 avg 203 (+37% vs P1-5 avg148, +150% vs pre-game hist ~81), stable regime length 5 periods post-P6 acceleration (carryover). Pipeline: OH=48 + IT=350, but IT bloated by confirmed lost/delayed P1(104u overdue~9pd), P3(186u overdue~7pd), P4(28u overdue~6pd) totaling ~318u ghosts + recent P10(32u); effective reliable pipeline ~80u, low vs ~200 demand. Observed LTs (chronological by placement): P2=2, P5=1, P7=1, P8=2, P9=1 (all 5 avg=1.4, mixed 1-2 no new drift). Use recent_N N=5 for L (avg LT~1.4), mu_hat, sigma_hat to set (1+L)~2.4 * recent mean~203 \u2192 mu~488 for base stock, compensating bloated IT subtraction & losses for coverage over ~2.4pd demand (~488); recent sigma low (~14) fits stable regime. Ensures high service despite unreliability, balancing profit vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand high regime sustained P6-10 avg 203 (+37% vs P1-5 148); lost shipments pattern: P1(104u),P3(186u),P4(28u) persist in IT bloating pipeline by ~318u as of P10 conclude (overdue 9,7,6pd)

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29), post-Easter (4/21) spring period for women's casual tank top; seasonal demand rise expected into summer. High demand regime sustained P6-11 avg 225 (regime length 6 since acceleration changepoint P6, +39% vs P1-5 avg148 per carry-over), P11=337 likely one-off Easter spike (+66% vs P6-10). Pipeline 562 bloated by lost shipments P1(104 overdue~10pd), P3(186~8pd), P4(28~7pd) totaling ~318u (persist from carry-over); actual pipeline ~244u from P10(32, likely LT=2 due P11), P11(212). On-hand=0 after P11 undersupply (sold 48/337). Reconcile overdue losses by inflating coverage via high mu_hat. L default (promised 2, matches observed LT=2 for P8/P10 despite mixed 1-2 avg~1.4 and losses). mu_hat recent_N N=6 captures sustained high regime (3*225.5~676 base). sigma_hat recent_N N=6 for elevated vol. Ensures base_stock >>562 bloated pipeline to trigger orders ~100+, balancing service (high recent demand) vs holding; adapts OR to regime ignoring hist low samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6), early May spring/summer transition for women's lace tank top; seasonal demand high sustained (P1-12 avg 191, P6-12 recent regime avg 221 vs hist ~81). Near US Mother's Day (5/12 ~P14), proactive for potential spike post-P11 (337). OH=0, IT=677 bloated by confirmed lost P1(104u overdue ~12pd), P3(186u ~10pd), P4(28u ~9pd) total ~318u + pending P10(32u overdue past LT2 expected P12), P11(212u past LT1 P12), P12(115u LT1 P13?). P12 conclude arrived=0 confirms recent delays. Observed LTs: P2=2, P5=1, P7=1, P8=2, P9=1 (avg 1.4, recent mixed). Use default L=2 (promised, conservative coverage 3pd). Explicit mu_hat=981: 3pd recent forecast 221*3=663 inflated +318 lost phantom to achieve effective real position ~663 (base - phantom). Explicit sigma_hat=90: recent_7 per-pd std~52 * sqrt(3).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13): Mid-spring, women's tank top seasonal relevance for warming weather, but demand mixed - sustained high regime P1-12 avg~185 (vs hist 80.8), acceleration P6+ avg~200, but P13 dip to 67 (possible anomaly/post-spike). On-hand 145 covers current low demand; IT 769 = lost~318 (P1:104, P3:186, P4:28 overdue 11+pd) + delayed P10:32 (overdue ~2pd past LT2 expect P12) + expected P12:115 (due P14 LT2), P13:304 (due P15). Bloated IT (ghosts) causes OR underordering; compensate with recent high demand focus. L 'calculate' uses avg observed LTs=1.5 (6 obs: 2,1,1,2,1,2) shorter than promised 2 to modestly reduce bs horizon amid bloat. mu_hat 'recent_N' N=10 (P4-13 demands mean~193, regime length~10 from P4 high sustained) captures high regime vs hist low. sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=10 high vol (spikes 337, dips 67,105). Params boost service/high mu despite ghosts, lower L curbs excess holding vs inflated pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20): Late spring/summer approach for women's cotton jersey tank top (seasonally relevant, potential demand uptick), but sharp demand drop P13-14 (67,61 avg64, -70% vs P1-12 game avg~185 sustained high regime); Easter (4/21/19) aftermath possible (P11 post-Easter spike 337, P12 197, then crash). On-hand 199 covers ~3x recent demand; in-transit 654 bloated by confirmed lost P1(104 overdue~14pd),P3(186~12pd),P4(28~11pd) ~318u + P10(32 overdue~5pd). Recent LTs stable LT=2 (P11 arr P13, P12 arr P14). No stockout risk; parameters set low mu_hat/sigma_hat via recent_N=3 (P12-14 demands: mean~108 std~77) to yield base_stock~(1+2)*108=324 < pipeline 853, ensuring order~0 minimizes holding on bloated/lost pipeline while backend cap accommodates vol.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, Memorial Day week): women's summer tank top (cotton jersey lace vest), seasonal demand uptick expected post transient early-May dip P13-14 (67,61 avg64, -65% vs prior ~180; likely weather/seasonal lull), confirmed recovery P15=162 aligning high regime (recent10 P6-15 avg184 +127% vs hist80.8, sustained despite volatility w/ changepoint P6 accel to ~200 sustained to P12/P15 highs). On-hand=37 critically low (P15 demand162>ending37), IT=654 entirely overdue lost/delayed (P1:104 ovd~15pd, P3:186~13pd, P4:28~12pd, P10:32~6pd, P13:304~3pd past LT=2 expected P15 arr); effective pipeline~37 only, backend blind to losses overstates IP=691. Recent LT confirmed=2 (P11/P12 arr), no drift in arrived orders. L=default (promised2). mu_hat=explicit 1206= normal3*184(recent10 mean)+654 bloat compensation, targets effective base_stock~552 for 3pd@184/ pd. sigma_hat=recent_N N=10 (regime~10pd post-P6 changepoint, std~79pd high vol). Orders~1206-691=515 rebuilds effective coverage to high-demand regime w/o excess holding given p=h=1; cap ample via high sigma.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments pattern worsened: P10(32u overdue~6pd), P13(304u overdue~3pd) added to P1/P3/P4; total bloat 654u (+106% vs prior318u) as of P15 conclude, sustained over 5+ orders

Apparent pipeline=335 OH +696 IT=1031, but sustained lost shipments ~654u (P1:104, P3:186, P4:28, P10:32, P13:304 overdue 7+pd as of P17 concl) + real IT P17:42u = real pipeline ~377u. Target real IP=(1+2)*190\u2248570; deficit ~193u. Set mu_hat explicit=1250 (=570 target real +654 bloat +buffer) to force OR order ~219u (1250-1031), reaching real ~596u. L explicit=2 (promised/observed avg~1.5 but losses separate). sigma_hat explicit=200 ensures cap ample: per-pd mean=1250/3\u2248417, sigma_per=200/\u221a3\u2248115, cap\u2248417+1.64*115\u2248607>219. Recent demand changepoint: post-dip recovery P15-17 avg184 (+187% vs P13-14 avg64).

Carry-over insight: Demand dip P13-14 (avg64, -70% vs P6-12 high ~220) resolved at P15: sustained high P15-17 avg184 (+187% vs dip), consistent with summer tank top seasonality

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24): Summer peak for women's tank top (June, high seasonal demand confirmed sustained P15-19 avg 187.6, +132% vs hist ~81; P19=230 reinforces). On-hand=167 likely covers ~1pd demand (~200) but vulnerable to stockout if P20 arrivals low/missing. IT=1003 bloated by ~650u permanent lost shipments (P1:104, P3:186, P4:28, P10:32, P13:304, P17:42+ overdue >LT=2 expectation), real pipeline ~350u (e.g., P19:307). Observed LTs avg~1.44 (9 arrives: five LT=1, four LT=2), varies no new regime. Offset bloat by explicit mu_hat=1220 (=3*188 expected demand over L+1 +650 bloat), yielding order~(1220-1170)=50 to cover true net need despite overstated pipeline. L=default (promised=2) for backend consistency. Sigma=default (captures full hist vol incl recent std~31 high). Ensures backend base_stock ignores lost IT bloat, targets service w/o excess on-hand holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments bloat worsened to ~1003u IT (+54% vs P15's ~654u) as of P19 conclude; P17 order (42u) overdue ~2pd past LT=2 confirming pattern sustained over 7+ orders

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1): Peak summer for women's lace tank top (essential casual jersey vest); high demand sustained (P15-20 avg 217, last 3 P18-20: 251 avg, P20 spike 366 confirms seasonal acceleration). On-hand=0 risks stockout; IT=1053 massively bloated by chronic lost shipments (~1003u per carry-over P20 insight, sustained 8+ orders, e.g., P1/P3/P4/P10/P13/P17 persist overdue 10+pd). Hist samples (winter avg 80.8, std~13) irrelevant to summer regime. LT observed avg~1.44 (9 arrives: mix 1-2, recent 1.33 last 3), but use default L=2 (promised). Compensate bloat by explicit mu_hat=1893 = 1053(bloat) + 3pd*280 (upadjusted recent 228 avg for peak seasonality/P20 evidence); targets base_stock~1893 for order~840 (real coverage despite ghosts). Sigma explicit=131=sqrt(3)*75.4 (recent_5 std P16-20) boosts cap~1893/3=631 + 1.645*131/1.732\u2248631+124=755. Balances high service vs holding by inflating target only for ghosts.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8): Peak summer season for women's casual tank top (jersey with lace), sustaining high demand regime post-P14 dip (P13-14 avg64). Recent P15-21 (7pd): demands 162,209,180,157,230,366,174 avg211 (+152% vs hist~81), sd~73 confirmed sustained changepoint (7pd evidence). Massive IT=1809 reflects sustained lost shipments (~50% empirical loss rate per arrived/ordered tally ~1737 arrived vs current IT), effective pipe~905 covers ~4pd demand > target~550, favors order=0 to curb holding risk while sporadic arrivals cover. Reconcile: no new P21 arr (P19 307u overdue past LT2 expect P21, confirms loss pattern); recent OH=0 stockouts P20-21 (199+174 lost sales) due timing despite pipe. L recent_5 obs LT (P18o:1,P16o:1,P12o:2,P11o:2,P8o:2 avg1.6) reflects mixed short/delayed regime. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 weights summer high/volatility (backend: ~2.6*211=549 mu, ~118 sigma, base=549<<1809\u2192order=0; cap irrelevant). Params boost target vs default (low hist mean~81\u2192~270) for service but pipe dominates.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15): Mid-summer peak for women's cotton jersey tank top (seasonal high demand expected ~200/period, consistent with P15-22 avg 200 sustained post-May dip P13-14). OH=0, IT=1759 bloated by sustained lost shipments (e.g., P1:104u overdue~20pd, P3:186u ~19pd, P4:28u ~18pd, P10:32u ~12pd, P13:304u ~9pd, others; total bloat >>1000u, no resolutions). Recent LTs avg 1.5 (10 obs: 2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,2; confirmed P22: P20 LT=2). No new arrivals of old orders. To counter bloat, explicit mu_hat=2360 (=1759 pipeline + 3*200 for promised LT=2 coverage), induces ~600 order-up-to (z=0 so base=mu_hat). L=calculate (backend avg~1.5, used in cap/scaling). Sigma=recent_8 (P15-22 regime post-dip changepoint, length=8, avg200 std~75; backend scales sqrt(2.5)~1.58*75~118). Cap~2360/2.5 +0.95*118 ~970 >600 safe.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22), peak summer for women's casual tank top (seasonal high demand confirmed P15-23 post-P13-14 dip). Recent demand P15-23: avg 192 (+137% vs hist 80.8), std~73.5 (regime length=9, sustained highs like 366 despite P22-23 softening to 121/132). Massive ghost bloat IT=1604 (total pipeline=2228 ~14x recent demand); lost pattern sustained/worsened (e.g., P17 42u, P19 307u overdue 7+/5+pd past LT=2). Recent LT=2 (P20/P21 orders arr P22/P23). Set L explicit=13 to reflect effective prolonged LT from losses (11+ pd bloat equiv), ensuring (1+L)=14 scales base_stock~2688 >2228. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=9 (chgpnt P15 post-dip evidence: avg192 sustained 9pd). Yields base>pipe, order=cap~192+1.64*73.5~312 (per-pd demand+safety), balancing service vs holding by replenishing real needs despite ghosts.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29): Late July peak summer for women's cotton jersey tank top with lace (casual upper body vest); expect sustained high demand ~200 despite volatility (P22-23 avg~127 low, P24=254 rebound, consistent with prior summer highs P15-24 avg198). Demand regime high post-P13-14 dip (sustained 10pd, avg198 vs hist~81). Reconcile inventory: on-hand=370 covers ~1-2pd, IT=1918 bloated by persistent lost/delayed shipments (P1/3/4/10/13/etc., total bloat >>1000u, recent orders P23=601/P24=314 pending). Observed LT recent 5 (P21/P20/P18/P16/P12 orders: 2,2,1,1,2 avg1.6); use recent_N=5 for L to match. mu_hat recent_N=10 (P15-24 demands avg198 *(1+L)) for summer high regime (length=10>3). sigma_hat recent_N=10 for vol/cap. High mu_hat forces base_stock > bloated IT (backend subtracts ghost pipeline), ensuring orders despite losses; balances service (avoid stockouts like P12/16/20/21/24) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments bloat worsened to 1918u IT (+91% vs ~1003u at P19 conclude) pre-P25, sustained over 10+ orders (incl. recent P13=304u overdue 12pd+)

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5): Early August, peak summer season for women's tank tops (cotton jersey vest with lace); expect sustained high demand ~190-200 despite P25 dip to 99 (-61% vs P16-24 avg~210), as single-period not sustained (prior dip P13-14 only 2pd). OH=271 covers 1+ pd; IT=1918 bloated by chronic lost shipments (e.g., P1/3/4/13/others overdue 10-20+pd per carry-over), unreliable arrivals expected (P24's 314u due P26 if LT=2, but high loss risk). Recent demand regime high: P16-25 avg192 (+138% vs hist~81), volatile (P20=366, P25=99); use recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture summer high/volatility. LT observed 11x avg~1.55 (recent 5: P13-23 LTs=2,2,1,1,2 avg1.6), no sustained drift beyond promised 2; use recent_N=5 for L to reflect mixed 1-2pd. With z=0 (q=0.5), base_stock=mu_hat~(1+1.6)*192~490 << pipeline=2189, so order~0 conserves holding costs amid ghost bloat; params ensure backend targets recent regime without overordering.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12): Late summer for women's tank top; demand post-peak trending down (P22-26 avg 137, P25-26 89 avg -65% vs prior summer highs ~200, volatile with P24 spike 254). Real position OH793 + real IT~314 (P24 pending, likely LT=3 like P23)=1107 >> desired real base~(1+1.8)*140=~380.

Default/recent mu_hat too low (<500) vs bloat prevents future orders when real depletes. Compensate with explicit mu_hat=1450=ghosts1003 + real target (1+1.8avgLT)*160 (blending sustained high regime avg~155-200 w/ recent 137). L recent_N=6 (last LTs:3,2,2,1,1,2 avg1.83, incl new LT3).

OH=740 ample (~10pd at 77/d), IT=1317 bloated w/ sustained lost shipments (~1000u ghost per history), actual position still high vs low recent demand. LT observed: 12 arrivals avg1.67; recent 5 (P16/18/20/21/23 orders: LT1,1,2,2,3 avg1.8). Set L recent_5 N=5 (~1.8, captures recent LT=3 variation w/o overestimating); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_3 N=3 (regime length=3, mean~77 std~23 low volatility). Lowers base_stock=mu_hat~(2.8)*77~216 to match dip, ensures order~0 vs bloated position (counteracts ghost IT underordering bias), balances low service need vs holding cost.

OH=681 + IT=1317 (bloated by persistent lost/delayed shipments, e.g., pre-P25 ~1918u now ~1317u after P26 LT=3 arrival of 601u); IP~1998 covers 25+ periods at recent demand. Recent LT obs (last 3: P23 ord LT=3 P26, P21 LT=2 P23, P20 LT=2 P22; avg~2.33) signals longer LT; use recent_N N=3 for L. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=4 for low regime (regime_length=4>3). Base_stock~mu_hat~(1+~2.33)*72.5~220 +0*sigma (z=0), <<IP so order~0, minimizes holding cost on bloat/excess while high service from stock covers low demand/loss risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime sustained P25-28 avg72.5 (-65% vs prior high ~205), 4 periods with P28=59 confirming no rebound

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2): Early September, end-of-season for women's summer tank top; low demand regime sustained P25-29 (demands 99,79,53,59,83; avg 74.6, -64% vs prior high P18-24 avg~205), consistent with seasonal decline into fall. On-hand 598 + IT 1317 (bloated by persistent lost/delayed shipments, e.g., P1/P3/P4/P10/P13/etc. overdue 20+pd) provides massive coverage (>15 periods at recent avg). No need for aggressive ordering. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on low regime (N=regime_length=5). L 'calculate' uses avg of 12 observed LTs (1,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,2,3,2? ~1.67) despite losses (OR unaware, bloated IT suppresses orders naturally). Ensures base_stock ~ (1+1.67)*74.6 ~220 low for period, balancing low service need vs high holding risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime extended P25-29 avg74.6 (-64% vs P18-24 ~205), sustained 5 periods confirming late summer/early fall tank top decline; Lost shipments bloat persists ~1317u IT as of P29 conclude (reduced post-P26 arr but still over 10+ orders)

LLM Rationale:

Huge pipeline bloat: OH=523 covers ~7 periods demand, IT=1317 (lost/delayed incl. P24=314 overdue ~5pd past LT=2, pattern sustained per carry-over). Recent LTs avg~1.8-2 (e.g., P23 LT=3, prior mix 1-2); use default L=2 (promised). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=6 captures low regime for (1+2)*74.7~224 mean, sqrt(3)*16.7~29 vol over review+LT; low base_stock - bloated pipeline \u2192 order~0, minimizes further holding costs (q=0.5, z~0) while covering low demand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16): Late September, post-summer seasonal decline for women's tank top confirmed; demand low regime sustained P25-31 (demands:99,79,53,59,83,75,74; avg=74.6, std~14.1; -64% vs P18-24 high ~205). OH=449 (~6pd cover at 75/dmd), IT=1317 bloated by chronic lost shipments (sustained pattern, stable from P29-31 concludes, no recent arrivals). All-samples mean~156 (early/mid-year highs balance recent lows), but default mu_hat~(1+2)*156=468 << pipeline=1766, would order=0 perpetuating risk of stockout after OH depletes (~6pd) with lost IT never clearing. To force replenishment: explicit mu_hat=2100 targets base_stock>pipeline yielding order~334 (4.5pd cover), within cap~700+130=830; L default=2 (promised, observed avg~1.7 but losses justify conservative); sigma_hat default (higher historical std boosts cap safety term). Addresses bloat/underordering while matching low demand; gradual rebuild since profit=h=1, avoids excess hold risk amid loss pattern.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Late September, end-of-season for summer tank top (women's casual jersey vest); low demand regime shift at P25 confirmed and sustained P25-32 (demands:99,79,53,59,83,75,74,70; avg=74, -64% vs prior P18-24 avg~205), consistent with seasonal decline into fall. High OH=379 covers ~5 periods of low demand (~74/pd); bloated IT=1651u (per carry-over lost pattern, no arrivals P27-32 despite overdue orders, e.g., P32 order just placed but prior persist). Recent LTs mixed (last: LT3 P23@P26, LT2s before); avg observed LT~1.7 but losses distort. Use default L=2 (promised); recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime len=8>=3, cap20) to set low mu_hat~(1+2)*74=222, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*~15~26; low base_stock ~222 + z*26 (z~0 q=0.5) << pipeline~2030 ensures order~0, minimizes holding costs on high OH/IT while covering low demand service.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime extended P25-32 avg74 (-64% vs P18-24 ~205) sustained 8 periods confirming end-of-season tank top decline; Lost shipments bloat persists ~1651u IT as of P32 conclude, no arrivals P27-32 (6pd) sustaining pattern over 10+ orders

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Massive IT bloat 1651u (lost shipments pattern sustained, includes P32's 334u expected LT=2 arrive during P34 visible P35); OH=280 covers ~3-4 periods low demand. Recent LT observations mixed (avg~1.7 across 12, recent incl.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7): Early October, post-summer decline for women's tank top confirmed by low demand regime P25-34 (10 periods, avg 72.6, latest P34=35 -53% vs regime avg, trending down to near-zero expected). OH=245 + IT=1651 (bloated by chronic lost shipments, no arrivals P33-34, covers 20+ periods at 73/wk). Reconcile: no new arrivals past expected LT=2 (e.g., P32 order=334 overdue 3pd if LT=2, adds to pattern). Observed LTs mixed (recent: LT3 P26, LT2s prior; avg all~1.67). Chgpoint: low regime sustained (no rebound). Set L=calculate (avg observed LT handles var/loss proxy); mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_10 (P25-34: mean73 low, std~20 low vol) weights current regime >> early highs, yields low base_stock ~73 + 0*z*20 (q=0.5) for 1+L~3pd, minus huge pipeline= near-zero order balancing high holding vs low profit/service need.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime extended P25-34 avg72.6 (-64% vs P18-24 ~205) sustained 10 periods confirming end-of-season tank top decline, P34=35 deepest drop; Lost shipments bloat ~1651u IT persists (no arrivals P33-34, P32 order overdue~3pd sustaining 10+ orders)

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Late fall, tank top demand in deep end-of-season decline sustained P25-35 (11 periods, avg 71.8, range 35-99, -64% vs prior summer high ~205), consistent with product seasonality shift to winter apparel. High OH=515 + bloated IT=1317 (persisting lost shipments pattern, reduced slightly post-P35 arrival of 334u from P32 but still ~1300u ghosts). Recent LTs: last 2 observed=3 (P23 LT3 in P26, P32 LT3 in P35), prior mix 1-2, delays/losses suggest longer effective LT; set L explicit=3 to bridge OR backend's promised LT=2 gap and target coverage over extended lead+review. Low regime changepoint at P25 validated (N=11=min(regime_length=11,20)); recent_N N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat yields low ~ (4x71.8)=287 mean demand over 1+L=4pd + low vol, z=0 (q=0.5) base_stock ~287 << pipeline=1832 ensures order~0, minimizes holding on excess inv while service safe for ~70pd demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime extended P25-35 avg71.8 (-64% vs P18-24 ~205) sustained 11 periods confirming deep end-of-season tank top decline; LT=3 confirmed recent (P32 order in P35, following P23 in P26)

OH=456 covers ~6+ periods demand; IT=1317 bloated by persistent lost/delayed shipments (no arrival P36; pattern over 10+ orders, reduced post-P35 arrival but still high ~1651 at P32). Recent LT=3 confirmed (P32->P35=3, P23->P26=3); prior mixed 1-3 but drift to longer/losses. Set L explicit=3 to inform backend of actual LT drift/loss risk, extending coverage period. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=12 for low mean/vol regime (backend: ~4*70.75=283 mu_hat, low sigma reduces z* base_stock); lowers target vs default/all-history, prevents ordering into bloated pipeline/high holding, balances service vs cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4): Late fall tank top (summer garment), deep low demand regime since changepoint P25 (post P24=254 high), sustained 14 periods P25-38 avg 68.9 (sum=964, -66% vs prior high P18-24 avg~205, -15% vs pre-season hist~81), no rebound expected into winter. OH=341 covers ~5-6pd demand at 60/pd; IT=1317 bloated by persistent lost/delayed shipments (no arrivals P36-38, pattern sustained). Recent LT=3 confirmed (P23->P26 LT3, P32->P35 LT3). Set L explicit=3 to extend coverage for LT drift/loss risk; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=14 for low regime mean/volatility (evidenced by 14pd consistency post-changepoint). Backend base_stock~mu_hat~(1+3)*68.9=276 << pipeline=1658, ensures order~0 minimizing holding on excess inv.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11): Mid-November winter for women's summer tank top; demand low regime P25-39 sustained 15pd avg66 (-68% vs summer P18-24 ~205), deepening further P34-39 avg50 (-35% vs P25-33 avg77) sustained6pd consistent w/ seasonal winter crash (P39=26). On-hand315 + IT1317=1632 pipeline hugely bloated vs tiny demand (~50/wk); expect minimal/no sales ahead, prioritize low base_stock to avoid orders/holding costs. L recent_5 (last LT obs: P18=1,P20=2,P21=2,P23=3,P32=3 avg2.2) captures recent LT=3 confirmations amid losses. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_15 weights full low regime (N=15=min(regime_len15,20)) to slash mu_hat~(1+2.2)*66~200 vs default~ (1+2)*80~240, low sigma curbs safety stock; balances high service (cover via bloat) vs holding.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18): Deep winter for tank top (women's summer casual vest); demand crash sustained, deepening decline changepoint P34 confirmed over 7 periods (P34-40 demands:35,64,59,62,53,26,50 avg~50, -35% vs P25-33 avg~77). On-hand 265 covers ~5 periods at 50/demand; IT 1317 bloated w/ persistent lost shipments (no holding cost, stable no recent arrivals P36-40). Recent LT=3 confirmed (P23->P26, P32->P35); older mixed but drifts/losses pattern. L explicit=3 bridges backend promised=2. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=7 captures low mean~50/vol~14 (backend scales to (1+3)*mean~200, sqrt(4)*14~28); conservative base_stock~200 (z=0,q=0.5) << pipeline=1582 triggers order=0, minimizes new holding amid low demand/endgame (41/47), relies on on-hand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25, late November Black Friday week): Women's summer tank top in winter off-season, demand crash confirmed. Recent demands P34-41 (8 periods): 35,64,59,62,53,26,50,40 avg 48.6 (deepening low regime -37% vs prior P25-33 ~77, sustained 8pd per carry-over). On-hand 225 covers ~4.6 periods demand; IT 1317 bloated by persistent lost shipments (over 10+ orders, overdue many pd, unreliable supply). LT recent confirmed LT=3 (P23->P26, P32->P35); earlier variation but pattern shift sustained. No arrivals P36-41 (6pd). Parameters: L explicit 3 (recent confirmed LT); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=8 (regime_length=8 for deepening decline since P34, N=max(min(8,20),3)=8) yields low mu_hat~(1+3)*48.6=194, sigma_hat~sqrt(4)*std_recent~ low volatility. Ensures low base_stock << pipeline 1542, order~0 to avoid adding to on-hand holding losses (profit=holding=1, prioritize depleting excess inv vs low demand service).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2): Deep winter (early December) for summer tank top confirms sustained demand crash/low regime since P25 late July (18pd total, avg~66), deepening decline changepoint P34 (avg50 P34-39 sustained 6pd per carry-over, extended P34-42 9pd avg57.1 despite P42=125 holiday outlier ~+118% single-pd Black Friday/Thanksgiving bump not sustained). OH=100 covers expected ~50-60/wk low demand multiple pd (risk minor stockout if repeat 125); IT=1317 persistent lost bloat (stable ~1317-1651 past periods, overdue 10+ orders, no arrivals P36-42 7pd) >> base_stock ensuring order~0, prudent given low demand & sustained lost risk (10+ orders) avoids bloating IT further. Reconcile: no expected arrivals (no recent orders post-P32 arrived P35); lost persist bloating pipeline. L recent_5 arrived LTs (P18/P19 LT1, P20/P22 LT2, P21/P23 LT2, P23/P26 LT3, P32/P35 LT3 avg2.2) vs promised2 accounts LT variation. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_9 (P34-42 regime length9, N=9) low mean57.1*(1+L)~180-230 & vol base<<1417 pipeline balances low service/holding optimal q=0.5.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=69, IT=1317u lost bloat persists (no arrivals P36-43=8pd, pattern over 10+ orders, total pipeline=1386 >> low demand base_stock). Recent LT=3 confirmed (P32 arr P35, P23 arr P26). Set L explicit=3 to reflect recent drift/loss delays; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=10 to capture winter low mean/volatility (low mu ensures low base despite pipeline bloat, minimizing orders/holding amid dead IT weight; high z=q=0.5 balances low service need).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16): Mid-winter for summer tank top (vest top cotton jersey lace); demand deepening decline sustained P34-44 (11 periods, avg~53, -35% vs P25-33 ~77), confirmed by P44 d=38 fitting low regime post-Black Friday outlier P42=125; no rebound expected near Christmas (tank top irrelevant). Lost shipments bloat IT=1317u persists (no recent arrivals P36-44, overdue orders like P32 post-arrival but pattern sustained 10+ orders). Reconciled pipeline fake-high due to losses (e.g., P1/P3/P4 etc. never arrived). LT=3 confirmed recent (P23 arr P26 LT3; P32 arr P35 LT3). Parameters: L explicit=3 to extend horizon accounting for LT drift/losses (backend assumes promised=2); mu_hat recent_11 (N=11 regime length P34-44 low demand); sigma_hat recent_11 matching low/vol regime. Yields low base_stock~212 (53*(1+3)) <<1317 IT so order~0 avoiding bloat, balances low service need vs holding (z=0 exact, profit=holding=1); low mu/sigma prepares backend for continued crash if IT ever clears.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23 Christmas week): Tank top demand in deep winter crash confirmed, irrelevant for holidays; recent P43-45 demand 31/38/42 avg37 (stable low post-P42=125 outlier), P34-45 avg52 sustained 12pd regime (-~35% vs prior highs). On-hand=0, IT=1317 bloated from sustained lost shipments (no arrivals P36-45=10pd, stable IT post-P35 arr, overdue orders like P1/P3/P4/P10+ persist >>LT=2/3). Expected arrivals=0 (recent pattern). LT recent confirmed=3 (P23 arr P26 LT3, P32 arr P35 LT3); set explicit L=3 to account for drift/losses. mu_hat recent_12 (P34-45 avg52.1 x4=208) for low regime covering 4pd low demand ~208 avoiding excess base amid bloat. sigma_hat recent_12 captures current volatility (high due to lows/spike). Backend base~208 <<1317 IT so order=0 optimal: prevents adding to lost bloat risk, accepts minor stockouts (~40u pd lost profit=holding cost equiv) vs excess hold risk. q=0.5 balances service/hold perfectly for low demand.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments bloat persists 1317u IT stable as of P45 conclude, no arrivals P36-45 (10 periods) sustaining pattern over 10+ orders; Demand winter crash extended P34-45 avg52 sustained 12 periods confirming tank top collapse

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Reconcile: overdue/lost persist (stable IT), no expected arrivals soon. L=explicit 3 (confirmed recent: P23 arr P26 LT3, P32 arr P35 LT3). mu_hat=explicit 1477=1317(IT)+160[4pd*40(recent low mean)] to force base_stock > IT despite losses, targeting order~160 for low demand coverage. sigma_hat=recent_N N=13 (regime deepening decline P34 changepoint sustained 13pd, N=min(13,20)=13) for vol. Ensures OR orders buffer over phantom pipeline (base=1477, order=160 < cap~369+), balancing low service need vs holding (z=0 conservative); compensates losses by inflating target.
