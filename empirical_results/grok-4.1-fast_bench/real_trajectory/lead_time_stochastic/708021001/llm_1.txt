Date 2019/12/16: mid-December winter, pre-Christmas (Dec 25 Wednesday); low seasonal relevance for winter sportswear, but potential holiday apparel/gift sales boost despite category mismatch. Historical data (Feb-Aug peaks, fall-winter lows) aligns, yet recent spike defies pure seasonality. (b) Demand regimes: Winter very low confirmed P37-P40 avg8 (std~1.3), but sharp reversal P41-P44:3,14,33,57 (avg27, +238% vs prior); accelerating uptrend P42-P44 avg35 suggests pre-Christmas anomaly/spike, volatile but 3+ periods evidence vs sustained low. Forecast P45-P47: 60-80/period (extrapolating trend, holiday peak then drop). (c) Lead time varies 1-3 periods (recent: P36 lt3 P39, consistent pattern); no new orders P38-P44 so no pending arrivals expected; in-transit 930=confirmed cumulative lost (no arrivals >6+ periods past for several). (d) Inventory: on-hand 248 (P44 end) covers ~4 periods at 60/demand (total ~180-240 need for P45-47); no pipeline arrivals; ample buffer vs low stockout risk end-game. (e) Order 0: high on-hand minimizes holding ($1/unit/period) over final 3 periods (projected ending inv ~0-70 low cost); avoids adding to lost pipeline risk; prioritizes profit from existing stock amid volatile holiday demand.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Pre-Christmas demand uptrend confirmed P42-P44 avg35 (14,33,57 +150% acceleration), +337% vs P37-P41 winter low avg7, 3 periods sustained shift ending prior very low regime.",
