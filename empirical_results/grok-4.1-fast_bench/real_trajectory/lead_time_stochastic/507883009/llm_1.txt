No major upcoming events (e.g., Women's Day Mar8 minor). (b) Demand regime: Historical avg (124,168,190,183,99)=153; recent P1=112, P2=169 (avg 140, but +51% period-over-period increase); no sustained shift (only 2 periods, needs 3+); forecast ~150-170/period conservatively blending history/recent uptick. (c) Lead time: Promised 2 periods; no concluded arrivals yet (normal - P1 order placed P1 expected arrive P3 after decision, visible in P4 obs; P2 order expected P4).

(e) Order logic: Endgame (5 periods left), high pipeline covers even w/ 50% losses (~1000+), but on-hand=0 + volatile arrivals risk near-term stockouts; order conservatively 150 (~recent avg + holiday buffer) to replenish pipeline for anticipated Christmas peaks P45-47 (arrive LT2-3), balance sales vs terminal holding; avoid 0 to hedge losses/delays.",
