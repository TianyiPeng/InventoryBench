{
  "rationale": "Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas period for tights/stay-ups; holiday peak confirmed through P46 (Dec 23, demand=132, part of P42-P46 sustained high avg ~130+ with spikes to 177), but now post-Christmas/New Year's eve expects sharp demand drop from peak as gifting season ends, shifting to stable winter levels (~80-100 avg from P33-P41). On-hand=0, risking immediate stockout in P47 (demand after decision), but in-transit=705 units is massively oversized (includes ~495+ junk/lost per carry-over, plus recent P44=160 exp P47 if LT=3, P45=120 exp P48 LT=3; recent LT=2-3 predominant/mixed, losses frequent). OR recommends 0 using promised LT=2 and full history (mean likely ~55-60 diluted by early/summer lows), correctly capping due to bloated pipeline exceeding base stock for (1+2)=3 periods demand (~150-300). Override consideration: junk inflates pipeline visibility but lost units never arrive (no holding cost, but no supply); still, effective supply likely covers 5-10 periods even at 100 demand (705/100~7 periods), far beyond needs. Holding cost $1/unit/period vs profit $4 makes overstock risky post-peak. Strategy: Follow OR 0 to avoid adding to future holdings amid expected demand dropoff; monitor P47 conclude for post-holiday demand confirmation and any P44 arrival (LT=3 from P44). No order ensures pipeline depletion without excess.",
