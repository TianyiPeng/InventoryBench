Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variable (avg ~1.4-3 periods per carry-over), with P44 order (200 units) overdue past LT=2 (no arrival in P46 conclude, expected P46), reinforcing lost shipment pattern (prior total 666 + potential 200 = 866 lost in pipeline). P46 order (300) just placed, unlikely to arrive soon. In-transit 1166 includes lost + pending, unreliable for near-term arrivals. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 risks P47 stockout (no guaranteed P47 arrivals from P45 order=0), but massive pipeline reduces need to order. Demand analysis: Holiday volatility sustained P43-P46 avg ~315 (297,132,475,271), +500% vs winter ~50 despite summery top mismatch, driven by Christmas prep/Black Friday/Cyber (P42=542). P47 (12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's Eve) expects sharp drop to winter low ~30-50 for summery satin V-neck top (skinny straps unsuitable for cold Dec). Historical pre-holiday avg low. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history (ignores recent spikes/losses), aligns with base-stock covered by pipeline despite OR limitations. Strategy: Follow OR 0 - prioritize avoiding more inventory (holding $1/unit/period) given unreliable 1166 pipeline and post-holiday demand crash; accept potential P47 stockout (low expected demand ~50, profit loss $950 max vs endless holding risk). No override needed as OR conservatively low amid volatility.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - 1166 in-transit (incl. ~866 lost/overdue) covers any needs despite on-hand 0; post-Christmas (12/30) demand for summery top expected to crash from holiday volatility avg 315 to winter low ~50, avoiding excess inventory.",
