Date 2019/12/30 (Mon) is post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week; post-holiday sales could boost apparel demand, but Christmas week P46 demand=23 was low despite seasonal shopping. Historical Jan demand avg~110 (114,94,135,102), suggesting potential ramp-up into 2020, but recent post-Thanksgiving/Christmas trend overrides with lows. (b) Demand regime: low post-holiday sustained P43-P46 avg 30 (24,37,36,23), confirming Period 46 insight (-37% vs prior moderate); stable low ~25-35/wk, no deepening/uptick yet despite calendar shift; prior summer low ended with back-to-school surge, but current winter low persists. (c) Lead time: recent LTs vary (2-3 periods, e.g., P40 order LT=3 in P43); no arrivals since P43; in-transit 900 units (per status/carry-over P38) confirmed lost (P29 250 + priors), no new conclude messages >9 periods past expected LT=2; lost shipment pattern continues, treat pipeline as 0. (d) Inventory: on-hand 685 (from P46 end), covers 20+ weeks at ~30/wk or 7 weeks at 100/wk Jan baseline; no expected arrivals (lost in-transit); high stock from prior over-ordering during moderate regime. (e) Order 0: high on-hand buffers low demand + potential Jan uptick (historical ~100); avoid adding to holdings amid LT/loss risk and $1/unit holding cost; monitor P47 conclude for regime shift before ordering.",
