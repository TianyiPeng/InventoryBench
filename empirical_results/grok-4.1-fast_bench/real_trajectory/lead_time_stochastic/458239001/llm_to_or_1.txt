Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11), first decision with no prior history or conclude messages. Product is women's short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (everyday basics). Historical demands: [48,47,38,61,67], mean ~52.2, recent uptick (last 3: 38-67) but insufficient evidence for changepoint (need sustained pattern). Valentine's Day (2/14) upcoming, but no confirmed demand impact yet. No on-hand or in-transit; no lead time observations. Use defaults: L=promised 2; mu_hat=(1+2)*mean(all)=~156.6; sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*std(all). Ensures base stock covers expected demand over review+lead with standard service level q=19/(19+1)=0.95, balancing profit vs holding.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18), mid-February, women's short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (everyday basics, no strong winter seasonality but possible pre-spring steady demand). P1 demand=62 confirms recent high regime (historical: 2019-01-28:61, 02-04:67, P1:62; avg=63.3) vs early low (01-07:48,01-14:47,01-21:38; avg=44.3), changepoint after 01-21 (+43% shift, sustained 3 periods). On-hand=0, will lose P2 sales; in-transit=72 (P1 order) expected P3 arrival (LT=2, no observed arrivals/concludes yet to infer otherwise). No overdue shipments. Use default L (promised=2). recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set mu_hat~(1+2)*63.3=190 (covers higher demand over 3 periods), low recent sigma~2.5 \u2192 sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*2.5~4.3 (tight volatility); raises base_stock for high service (q=19/20=0.95) to avoid lost sales post-P3 while limiting hold costs vs default lower mean~52.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift after 2019-01-21: early avg 44.3 (3 periods) to recent avg 63.3 (+43%), sustained 3 periods and confirmed P1=62

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25), late February post-Chinese New Year (Feb 5, 2019), women's everyday short-sleeved cotton jersey dress. Demand regime shift confirmed post-2019-01-21: early avg 44.3 (48,47,38), recent avg 65 (last 4: 61 on 01-28, 67 on 02-04, 62 P1, 70 P2; +47% shift, sustained 4 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=141 (P1 order=72 + P2=69), no arrivals observed yet (expected P1 order in P3 arrival if LT=2, visible P4; P2 in P4 arrival). No overdue shipments or losses inferred. Lost sales P1=62, P2=70 due to stockout. L=default (promised 2, no observed LTs). mu_hat=recent_N N=4 for (1+2)*65=195 demand over review+LT, sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 to match elevated/volatility regime. High q=19/(19+1)=0.95 demands high service; parameters boost base_stock to cover ~3 periods high demand, reduce stockouts/profit loss, cap prevents excess holding.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4, early March): Women's short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, everyday basics; approaching spring but no major events; demand regime post-01-21 shift confirmed higher (historical early avg~44, recent sustained ~67-69). Recent demands P1=62, P2=70, P3=76 (avg 69.3 last 3, avg 67.2 last 5 incl historical 01-28:61,02-04:67). On-hand=0, no sales due to stockouts; in-transit=208 (P1:72 overdue - expected arrive P3 if LT=2 but P3 conclude arrived=0; P2:69 expected P4; P3:67 expected P5). Evidence of LT>2 (P1 overdue 1+ period). Set L=explicit 3 to account for delays, ensuring OR covers longer pipeline. mu_hat recent_5 (N=5, regime length=5 since 01-28 changepoint: sustained high mean post-shift evidence in demands). sigma_hat recent_5 (higher recent vol ~6 vs early ~4.5). This boosts base_stock target for high service (q=19/20=0.95) to cover rising demand + delays, minimizing stockouts while capping overorder; bridges OR's ignorance of actual LT/delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand sustained high avg 67.2 over 5 periods (2019-01-28 to P3=02-25, +52% vs early); first overdue shipment: P1 order missed expected P3 arrival (arrived=0 in P3 conclude)

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11, early March): women's short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (everyday basics), no imminent holidays/seasonal spikes. Demand sustained high regime post-2019-01-21 changepoint (evidence: early avg~44 vs last 6 periods 2019-01-28 to P4=03/04: 61,67,62,70,76,63 avg=66.5, +51%; N=6=max(min(regime_length=6,20),3)). P1 order=72 lost (expected P3 arrival for L=2, but arrived=0 in P3/P4 conclude; now 72 units indefinitely inflating in-transit=217=72lost+67(P3 exp P5)+78(P4 exp P6)). On-hand=6 low. Reconcile: overstated pipeline by 72 requires higher base_stock. Set L=explicit 3 (missing shipment signals effective longer exposure); mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=6 \u2192 mu_hat=4*66.5=266, sigma_hat=\u221a4*5.76\u224811.52; base_stock\u2248266+1.645*11.52\u2248285 (q=0.95); order\u2248min(285-223\u224862, cap\u224876) replaces lost/buffer high demand vs holding.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (72 units) confirmed lost: expected P3 arrival (L=2), but arrived=0 in P3 conclude and no mention in P4 conclude

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Spring period for women's short-sleeved cotton jersey dress; no immediate holidays (St. Patrick's past, Easter 4/21 distant), steady high demand expected. Demand sustained high regime (changelpoint post-2019/01/21 confirmed, now 5 periods P1-P5 avg 73.8: 62/70/76/63/78, +67% vs early hist avg 44.3). Pipeline: in-transit 279 (cumulative P1-P5 orders 348 minus 69 arrived; P1:72 lost, P3:67 lost as no P5 arrival/conclude, P4:78 exp during P6 L=2, P5:62 exp P7); on-hand 0. Only confirmed LT=2 (P2 order->P4). L=default (matches promised/observed). mu_hat=recent_5 (N=5, regime length=5+; backend computes 3x73.8~221). sigma_hat=recent_5 (N=5, recent std~7.7; backend sqrt(3)x7.7~13.3). Params boost base_stock for high recent demand/volatility, high q=19/20=0.95 service vs holding; compensates losses by high mu/sigma despite default L.

Carry-over insight: P3 order (67 units) confirmed lost: expected P5 arrival (L=2), arrived=0 in P5 conclude, no later mention; pattern of losses (P1,P3) vs successful P2 L=2

Daily Reward (R_t): $1178.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Late March spring timing for short-sleeved cotton jersey women's dress aligns with seasonal demand ramp-up (pre-Easter April 21, spring fashion shift); sustained high demand regime (game avg 72.5 over 6 periods, last 3 avg 75.7 +9% vs first 3's 69.3, P6=86 peak). In-transit 217 = sum confirmed lost shipments P1(72)+P3(67)+P4(78), effective reliable pipeline=0, on-hand=0 risks stockout. No new arrivals expected soon. Bloated IP from permanent lost orders requires inflated parameters to force base_stock >217 for ordering despite junk pipeline. L default (promised 2) as observed LTs mixed 1-2 but losses imply unreliability. mu_hat explicit 255 = 3*85 (seasonal forecast: recent 72.5\u219285 uplift for spring continuation/P6 trend). sigma_hat explicit 20 \u2248 sqrt(3)*11.55 (slight vol increase vs recent std 9.3 for safety). Yields base_stock\u2248255+1.645*20\u2248291 >217 (order ~74 near cap~85+1.645*11.55\u2248102, holding low $1 favors service). Compensates losses by overriding low default mean, balances high profit service vs cost.

Carry-over insight: P4 order (78 units) confirmed lost: expected Period 6 arrival for L=2, but Period 6 conclude shows arrived=62 only from P5 (no P4 mention); lost pattern strengthened (P1=72, P3=67, P4=78; 50% orders lost, bloat=217 units in-transit)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/04/01), approaching Easter (04/21) ~3 weeks away; spring short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (women's everyday basics) likely sees rising demand. Recent demands accelerating: P5=78, P6=86, P7=94 (last 3 avg=86, +27% vs P1-P4 avg=67.75); overall game avg~76 but trending up ~+8/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=288 bloated by confirmed lost P1=72 (exp P3), P3=67 (exp P5), P4=78 (exp P6) total 217 ghosts; effective pipeline ~71 (P7 order only). No new arrivals in P7 conclude. To compensate losses/bloat (backend subtracts full pipeline), use explicit L=3 (longer effective LT vs promised 2, given delays/losses ~50%); explicit mu_hat=450 (~112/period trend forecast x4 periods); explicit sigma_hat=35 (elevated vol ~sqrt(4pd)*~17.5 std). Yields base_stock~450+1.645*35~507 -288~219 order, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding despite ghosts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: avg increased from 67.75 (P1-P4) to 86 (+27%) sustained over P5-P7 3 periods

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8): Early spring, short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (women's everyday basics) sees sustained demand growth into warmer weather; recent P5-P8 demands 78,86,94,109 (avg 91.75, +36% vs P1-P4 avg 67.25), regime shift at P5 confirmed over 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=359 (P1=72 lost, P3=67 lost, P4=78 lost totaling 217 bloat + P8=142 pending). Observed LTs from successful arrivals only: P2 L=2, P5 L=1, P7 L=1 (avg 1.33 over last 3). Use recent_N=3 for L to reflect shortening LT trend; recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high-demand regime (low recent sigma ~13 vs overall higher), inflating base stock vs bloated lost pipeline to boost orders/service despite cap; balances high q=19/20 service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand sustained high at avg 91.75 over P5-P8 (+8% vs prior P5-P7 86, +36% vs early); lost shipment bloat now 217 units (P1,P3,P4) persists

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter (4/21/19); short-sleeved cotton jersey dress suits spring demand. Recent demand P5-P10: 78,86,94,109,54,97 (avg 86.3, sustained high regime from P5 shift +27% vs prior per carry-over, despite P9 dip anomaly). On-hand 45 low, but pipeline 440 bloated (confirmed losses P1=72,P3=67,P4=78=217 + P10=223 pending). Observed LTs: P4 ccl (P2,L=2), P6 (P5,L=1), P8 (P7,L=1), P10 (P8,L=2); recent avg 1.5. No new arrivals expected P11 (P9 order=0). Set L recent_4 for avg 1.5 (reflects mixed 1-2, losses unaccounted so conservative vs explicit higher). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_6 (regime length 6 from P5 changepoint, high mean/volatility for (1+L)~2.5 periods ~215 mean). High q=19/20=0.95 drives service; params yield base~ mu +3sigma ~215+60~275 < pipeline 485 so order~0, avoids adding to bloat while covering via existing pipeline assuming some arrive.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29), late spring; short-sleeved cotton jersey women's dress sees sustained high demand regime since P5 changepoint (avg ~91 over P5-P11, +36% vs early), recent post-Easter (Apr 21) highs P10=97, P11=118 (avg 108 last relevant highs, volatility with P9=54 dip). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=440 (223 from P10 exp arrive P12 if L=2 + 217 persistent lost bloat P1=72/P3=67/P4=78, confirmed no-show past promised). Observed LTs on successes: 2(P2->P4),1(P5->P6),1(P7->P8),2(P8->P10) avg=1.5 but use default L=2 promised conservative given losses. To bridge OR unawareness of losses/phantom bloat (suppresses orders via pipeline subtraction), explicit mu_hat=547 = (1+2)*110 (upward recent demand forecast) +217 bloat offset, inflating base_stock ~547 + ~70 safety >440 pipeline to trigger ~177 order (within cap ~220), covering 3 periods real demand ~330 + safety net of phantom. Sigma default (sqrt(3)*~25 std_all ~43) for balanced volatility. Maximizes service (profit skew q=0.95) vs holding by ensuring real replenishment despite bloat.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6): Approaching Mother's Day (May 12, ~P14), short-sleeved cotton jersey women's dress likely sees continued high demand (~105/period forecast, up from early ~50s) with potential spike; recent P5-P12 avg demand 88.75 (+31% vs P1-P4 67.75), P11=118 peak post-Easter. On-hand=0, stockout P12 (demand=74, sold=0). In-transit=613=440 phantoms (confirmed lost: P1=72, P3=67, P4=78, P10=223 no P12 arr) +173 real (P12 order). Observed lead times (successful arrivals): P2->P4 L=2, P5->P6 L=1, P7->P8 L=1, P8->P10 L=2; recent avg=1.5. L=recent_N N=4 uses this avg. Normal mu_hat=(1+1.5)*105=262.5, sigma_hat=sqrt(2.5)*28\u224844 (recent std~28 P9-P12). Inflate explicitly mu_hat=262.5+440=702.5\u2192703 (offset phantoms), sigma_hat=200 (extra buffer for loss/volatility uncertainty); targets base_stock\u2248703+1.645*200\u22481031 (>613), order\u2248418 (effective real IP\u22481031-440=591, covers ~3 periods@105 + safety), balances high service (q=0.95) vs holding despite bloat.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments strengthened: P10 (223 units) confirmed lost (no Period 12 arrival, expected L=2); total lost=440 units (P1=72+P3=67+P4=78+P10=223) bloating in-transit; Demand volatility shift at Period 9: std=27.8 (P9-P12, 4 periods) vs 13.2 (P5-P8, +111%)

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/05/13), post-Mother's Day (May 12), short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (spring/summer everyday basic); recent demand volatile/dipping (P11=118, P12=74, P13=36 low), but sustained high-demand regime P5-P13 (9 periods, mean=82.9 +23% vs P1-P4=67.75). Pipeline=1032 bloated (440 confirmed lost P1/P3/P4/P10 + pending P12=173 due P14 LT=2 / P13=419 due P15); no recent arrivals (P13 arrived=0), loss pattern persists risking stockouts. Observed LTs unchanged (last: P8->P10 LT=2; prior 2,1,1,2 avg=1.5). To counter ghost bloat, explicit L=12 inflates base_stock~(1+12)*recent_mean + safety >1032 ensuring positive order; mu_hat recent_N=9 uses high regime P5-P13 (chgpnt evidence: sustained 9pd mean82.9>>early); sigma_hat recent_N=5 captures vol shift P9-P13 (std~32.7 +111% vs P5-P8=13.2, sustained 5pd). Cap remains ~83 + safety (~120), ordering reasonable refill w/o excess; high q=0.95 favors service vs holding.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/05/20): Late spring/early summer for short-sleeved cotton jersey dress; expect potential demand uptick into summer season despite recent dip (P13=36, P14=50 after P11=118 high, P12=74). Recent 5 demands (P10-P14: 97,118,74,36,50) avg=75 (down from prior highs ~86-91 but volatile), std~33.5 confirming sustained high volatility since P9 changepoint (std 27.8 P9-P12). On-hand 123 covers expected ~50-75 demand; in-transit 996 bloated by ~440 confirmed lost (P1=72,P3=67,P4=78,P10=223), reliable pipeline P13=419 (due P15 LT=2), P14=137 (due P16). No new overdues; P13 arrival expected during P15 post-decision. Use recent_N=5 for L (last 5 observed LTs: P14 LT2, P10 LT2, P8 LT1, P6 LT1, P4 LT2 avg=1.6, reflects mixed 1-2 vs promised 2), mu_hat/sigma_hat (captures recent regime mean 75/vol 33.5 for (1+L)~2.6 periods ~195 mu_hat, balances service amid losses/bloat vs holding; low order likely as base_stock << pipeline, prevents overorder while prepping recovery).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/05/27, Memorial Day Monday - potential holiday bump for short-sleeved summer jersey dress, but contradicted by data). Demand changepoint at P13: low regime avg 46.3 (P13=36,P14=50,P15=53; -48% vs P9-P12 avg 85.75), low vol std=7.5 (-73% vs P9-P12 27.8); regime length=3 periods, N=3. On-hand=70 covers expected ~50 demand. In-transit=996 bloated by lost shipments (cumulative ~859 units: P1=72,P3=67,P4=78,P10=223,P13=419; ~57% of total ordered units lost, success ~34%). Recent successes LT=2 (P12->P14, P8->P10). P14=137 expected arrive during P16 LT=2. L=calculate (all 5 observed LT: 2,1,1,2,2 avg=1.6). mu_hat=recent_N N=3 weights low regime ((1+1.6)*46.3~120). sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 low vol (sqrt(2.6)*7.5~12). Base_stock~120+1.6*12~140 << pipeline~1066, ensures order~0 (avoids bloat risk) while conservative service for low demand; high profit/holding ratio favors coverage but data-driven low params prevent over-targeting amid unreliable supply.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg 46.3 (P13-P15, -48% vs P9-P12 85.75), volatility drop std=7.5 vs prior 27.8 (-73%), sustained 3 periods; P13 order (419 units) confirmed lost (no P14 LT=1 or P15 LT=2 arrival), total lost units~859 (~57% of ordered), in-transit bloat=996 persists

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): Early summer for short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (women's basics); expect demand uptick post-P16=86 after low P13-P15 regime (avg46.3). All in-transit=996 confirmed lost (P1=72, P3=67, P4=78, P10=223, P13=419, P14=137; total=996), effective pipeline=0 but backend subtracts full bloat. No on-hand, recent demand P13-P16 avg56.25 (std_period~21.2), P16 spike to 86 aligns with summer. L=recent_N N=5 (observed LTs:2,1,1,2,2 avg1.6). sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 (regime post-P13 shift, std~21.2 \u2192 sigma_hat~sqrt(2.6)*21.2~34, z\u03c3~56).

On-hand=0, in-transit=1261 fully ghost (100% lost per carry-over, effective pipeline=0; latest P17 ordered=265 added to bloat, no real arrivals expected soon). No new conclude arrivals (P17 arrived=0, as expected from prior 0 orders). Recent successful LT=2 (P12->P14). Ghost bloat prevents ordering under normal params (base_stock<<1261). Set L=default (promised 2), mu_hat=default (~3*76.6 all-demand mean\u2248230), sigma_hat=explicit 800 (models extreme volatility from ~58% historical loss rate + demand swings, z*\u03c3\u22481316); base_stock\u2248230+1316=1546>1261, order\u2248285 (covers ~3 periods at recent 90/demand), cap\u224877+1.645*800/\u221a3\u224877+761=838>285 sufficient.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17): mid-June summer peak for short-sleeved cotton jersey women's dress; expect sustained high demand ~91/period (P16-P18: 86/96/89 avg=90.3, +95% vs P13-P15 low 46.3 anomaly, std=5.1 low vol). On-hand=0 (stockout P17=96/P18=89); in-transit=1530=confirmed lost 996 (P1/P3/P4/P10/P13/P14) + pending P17=265/P18=269 (likely lost per 65%+ historical loss rate on resolved, recent streak). Effective real pipeline~0; no arrivals P15-P18 despite due dates. Ghosts bloat pipeline, forcing OR order=0 otherwise. Reconcile overdue: all expected arrivals missed. Set L default (promised 2, matches recent successes P8-P10/P12-P14 LT=2). mu_hat explicit=1803=3*91 (real over 1+L=3) +1530 ghosts \u2192 base_stock~1967, order~437 (real coverage - exp real pipe 0). sigma_hat explicit=100 (boosted >>recent sqrt(3)*5.1~9 for supply loss uncertainty, adds ~165 safety). Balances high service (q=0.95) vs holding; forces ordering despite bloat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: summer high avg 90.3 (P16-P18, +95% vs P13-P15 46.3 low), low volatility std=5.1 (vs prior highs), sustained 3 periods; in-transit=1530 now 100% expected ghost (996 confirmed lost + P17/P18=534 pending likely lost per sustained 65%+ loss pattern, no P15-P18 arrivals)

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24), peak summer for short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (women's basics); demand regime P16-P19: 86/96/89/186 avg 114.25 (+148% vs P13-P15 low 46.3, sustained 4 periods post-shift P16), P19=186 spike signals intensified seasonal peak. Volatility high std=51.4 P16-P19 (+586% vs P13-P15 7.5). On-hand=83 low vs ~150-160/period forecast; in-transit=1699=1261 confirmed lost (P1/3/4/10/13/14/17:72+67+78+223+419+137+265) +438 P19 (sole real pipeline, but 65%+ historical loss rate risks it). Effective real IP~83+438*0.4=258 (conservative 40% success). Ghosts bloat backend IP=1782. Parameters compensate: L=calculate (avg observed LT=1.5 from 6 confirms:2/1/1/2/2/1); mu_hat explicit=2004=160*3 (high-season forecast* (1+~2)) +1261 ghosts +~263 P19 partial loss buffer, yields backend order=real_base-safety-adjusted (~636+extra) - real_IP (~378); sigma_hat recent_4 auto sqrt(1+1.5)*51.4~81 (high vol buffer z\u03c3~133), ensures high q=0.95 service despite ghosts/unreliable LT, minimizing stockouts (profit$19>>holding$1) while cap ample ~800+.

Carry-over insight: Demand summer peak intensified P16-P19 avg 114.25 (4 periods sustained, +26% vs P16-P18 90.3); volatility shift high std=51.4 P16-P19 (+586% vs P13-P15 7.5, sustained 4 periods); P17 order 265 confirmed lost (exp P19 LT=2, absent), total lost 1261 units (74% of in-transit 1699), loss pattern >65% sustained

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01): Peak summer for short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (everyday womens basics); demand regime summer high sustained P16-P20 avg 137.8 (P20=232 confirms intensification), high volatility std=67.1 (P16-P20 demands:86,96,89,186,232). Massive ghost pipeline: in-transit=2058 (100% bloat per sustained >70% loss pattern, P20 arrived=0, prior confirms P17/P19/etc lost, effective committed pipeline=0, on-hand=0). Reconcile: no expected reliable arrivals for P21 (P19 order=438 likely lost LT=2). To bridge OR backend's unawareness of ghosts/losses, set L=explicit 12 (high enough base_stock=(1+12)*137.8 + 1.645*sqrt(13)*67.1 \u22481791+398=2189 >2058 pipeline), forcing order = cap (one-period newsvendor) >0 instead of 0. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=5 (regime_length=5 >=3, changepoint P16 sustained evidence: +95% vs prior low, further +21% intensification). High q=19/20=0.95 implies z\u22481.645 high service; parameters yield cap\u2248138+110=248 balancing stockouts (profit loss) vs holding ($1 low), proactively covering volatile summer demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand summer peak intensified further P16-P20 avg 137.8 (+21% vs P16-P19 114.25), sustained 5 periods; volatility shift high std=67.1 P16-P20 (+31% vs 51.4 P16-P19), sustained 5 periods; loss pattern persists: P20 arrived=0 (no arrivals), in-transit bloat=2058 (100% ghost per >70% sustained losses)

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8, early summer Monday); short-sleeved cotton jersey dress aligns with summer demand drivers. Demand in sustained summer high regime P16-P21: avg 132.8 (86,96,89,186,232,108), +185% vs P13-P15 low 46.3, high volatility std=69.8 sustained 6 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=2190 confirmed ~77%+ ghost per sustained loss pattern (>75%, new P19=438 lost: exp P21 LT=2, arrived=0 P21 conclude; total lost~1699). No recent arrivals (P20-P21=0). Reconcile: effective pipeline~0, ghosts bloat prevents backend ordering. Use default L=2 (promised, matches avg observed LT~1.7 recent successful). Explicit mu_hat=2190(ghosts)+3*132.8=2589 to offset pipeline illusion; explicit sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*69.8\u2248121 for vol-adjusted safety over 3 periods. Yields base_stock\u22482589+1.645*121\u22482788, order\u2248598 (min cap~990), covers ~4.5 periods demand ignoring ghosts, maximizing service (q=0.95) for profit=19 vs holding=1 while bridging unreliable LT/losses.

Carry-over insight: P19 order (438 units) confirmed lost (exp Period 21 LT=2, arrived=0); total confirmed lost ~1699 units (77% of 2190 in-transit); loss rate >75% sustained; Summer demand high sustained P16-P21 avg 132.8 std=69.8 (6 periods, +185% vs P13-P15 46.3 low)

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15 mid-summer): Short-sleeved cotton jersey dress aligns with sustained summer demand regime P16-P22 avg 124.7 (+140% vs early ~52), std~60 sustained high vol (+300% vs early); P22 demand=76 dip not sustained (single period vs 3+ threshold). On-hand 283 covers ~2-3pd at 100pd forecast; in-transit 2430=total unarrived ordered 3575-arrived 1145, historical success 32% units arrived (68% lost sustained pattern), expected real pipeline ~283+777=1060 > real target base~375 mean 3pd +171 buffer=546, but sporadic arrivals (recent LT=1-2 mixed) risk gaps/stockouts given high vol/peak demand history (e.g. P20=232). Reconcile: P21 order 132 exp P23 LT=2 pending (likely lost per >65% pattern), no overdue flags beyond known ghosts. Counter ghost bloat by explicit high mu_hat=2800 (~3*125 real +~2250 ghost adjustment equiv), sigma_hat=250 (inflated sustained high vol); L default=2 promised (observed avg~1.6 recent_5=(2+1+2+2+1), close).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22): Late summer for short-sleeved cotton jersey dress; demand regime shifted down at P21 to avg 80.7 (P21-P23:108/76/58, -41% vs P16-P20 summer peak 137.8), low vol std=25.3 (-62% vs prior 67.1), sustained 3 periods confirming post-peak decline. On-hand 956 covers ~12 periods at 80/unit; position=3154 bloated by persistent ghosts (~1700+ confirmed lost, 2198 in-transit); recent arrivals P20/21/22 success (LT=2/2/1) but P19 lost, mixed pattern. Reconciled: expected P23 arrivals matched recent successes, no new overdues flagged, P23 order=499 pending LT=2 (P25). To avoid stockout trap (onhand depletes -> sold=0 -> position stuck high -> permanent no-order), explicitly inflate mu_hat=3300 forcing base~3372 >3154 for modest order~218 (~2.7x regime mean, replenishes LT+1 despite ghosts unreliable); sigma recent_3 captures new low-vol regime; L default=2 (promised, aligns recent obs avg~1.6). High service q=0.95 + low holding favors overstock vs stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg 80.7 P21-P23 (-41% vs P16-P20 137.8), std 25.3 (-62% vs 67.1), sustained 3 periods; Loss pattern weakening: recent 4 orders P19-P22 3 successes/1 lost (75% arrive) vs prior >75% loss

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05): late summer for short-sleeved cotton jersey dress; post-peak demand decline regime sustained P21-P25 (demands 108,76,58,94,69; avg=81, std=20; -41% mean/-62% std vs prior summer peak P16-P20, now 5 periods evidence). On-hand=793 covers ~10 periods recent demand; in-transit=2417 bloated with ghosts (P23 order 499 confirmed lost: exp P25 LT=2 but arrived=0; total confirmed lost ~2198; recent 5 orders P19-P23: 3 successes/2 lost=60% arrive rate). Recent LTs mixed 1-2 (avg~1.6 last 5: P21@2,P22@1,P20@2,P18@1,P12@2). Use 'calculate' for L (backend avg observed LT~1.56, <promised 2); 'recent_N' N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to match sustained low-demand regime (lowers base_stock vs full hist to aid inv drawdown). High pipeline >> base_stock (~240 + z*32)~280 suppresses order=0 as desired (sell down costly on-hand while ghosts inflate perceived pipeline); params bridge by using observed LT/demand, encouraging measured re-ordering post-depletion despite unreliability.

Carry-over insight: P23 order (499 units) confirmed lost (exp P25 LT=2, arrived=0 in P25 conclude); recent 5 orders P19-P23 arrival rate 60% (3/5 success, 40% loss rate improved vs prior >70% but unreliable sustained); post-peak demand regime sustained P21-P25 avg81 std=20 (5 periods, low vol confirmed)

Demand regime sustained 6 periods low mean/low-mod vol post-summer peak, use recent_N=6 for \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 \u2192 conservative \u03bc\u0302\u2248(1+1.8)\xd772=257, \u03c3\u0302\u2248\u221a2.8\xd728.4\u224847, base_stock\u2248257+1.64\xd747\u2248334 << pipeline=3183 \u2192 order=0, ideal to avoid adding to high real on-hand amid falling demand/season end, minimizing holding while service high (q=0.95); compensates OR's unawareness of ghosts by low params ensuring no overorder.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19): Late summer, short-sleeved cotton jersey dress demand in sharp post-summer drop regime; P26=27, P27=18 (avg 22.5, -72% vs P21-P25 post-peak avg81), emerging low-demand shift (2 periods, monitor for sustainment); high on-hand=1247 covers >50 periods at recent avg~50, in-transit=1918 bloated by prior ghosts/delays but recent pattern weakening (e.g., P23 499 delayed LT=3 not lost). No expected P28 arrivals (P26/P27 ordered=0). Reconcile: sustained delays/losses bloat pipeline, high inv risks holding costs. Set recent_N=5 for all: L (last 5 LTs: 3,2,1,2,1 avg~1.8 near promised 2, accounts delays); mu_hat (P23-P27 demands 58/94/69/27/18 avg53.2 x(1+L)~160, captures drop); sigma_hat (recent std~31, vol from transition). Low params yield low base_stock - high pipeline/on-hand = minimal order, balances high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding on excess inv, bridges OR ignorance of ghosts/delays.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26): Late summer/end of peak season for short-sleeved cotton jersey dress; demand collapsed post-P25 to new low regime P26-P28 avg=20.7 (27,18,17; -75% vs P21-P25 avg81), std~5 (-75% vs prior 20), sustained 3 periods confirming changepoint. High OH=1230 covers 60+ periods of low demand; in-transit=1918 bloated w/ ghosts (P24=219 confirmed lost: exp P26 LT2, absent P26-P28; prior ~60% recent loss rate persists). Recent LTs: last 5 observed (P23 LT3 P26, P22 LT1 P23, P21 LT2 P23, P20 LT2 P22, P18 LT1 P19) avg=1.8. Use recent_N N=5 for L to reflect shorter recent avg; recent_N N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to match low demand/vol regime, yielding low base_stock ~ (1+1.8)*20.7 + z* sqrt(1+1.8)*5 ~55 +1.6*2.9 ~60, minus high pipeline ~0 order, minimizing holding on excess while covering low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: avg 20.7 P26-P28 (-75% vs P21-P25 81), std~5 (-75% vs prior 20), sustained 3 periods; P24 order (219 units) confirmed lost (exp P26 LT=2, no arrival P26-P28), recent loss rate ~60% sustained

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02, Labor Day): short-sleeved cotton jersey summer dress; demand low regime since changepoint P26 (2019-08-05), P26-P29 demands 27/18/17/27 (avg 22.25, std 5.5, -73% vs P21-P25 avg 81, low vol -75% vs prior 20), sustained 4 periods confirmed by consistent lows into late Aug/early Sep (post-summer decline). High on-hand 1203 covers 54+ periods at current rate; in-transit 1918 bloated ~60% ghosts (e.g., P24/P19 lost, total pattern sustained), effective pipeline still ample vs low demand. Recent LTs: P26 LT=3, P23 LT=2/1, P22 LT=2 (recent avg ~2), use default L=2. Parameters: recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low (1+L)*22.25 ~67 mu, sqrt(1+L)*5.5 ~10 sigma; low base_stock + bloated pipeline \u2192 minimal orders, cuts holding costs ($1/unit) while high q=19/20 service covers risks from ghosts/unreliable arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime strengthened P26-P29 avg 22.25 std 5.5 (sustained 4 periods, -73% vs P21-P25 81, low vol -75% vs prior 20)

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9): Early September, post-Labor Day (Sep 2), end of summer season for short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (women's basics); demand collapsed to very low regime shift at P26, sustained P26-P30 avg=19 (demands:27,18,17,27,6; -73% vs prior P21-P25 avg81), low vol std~8.7 (vs prior 20). On-hand=1197 covers 60+ periods of ~20 demand (holding risk but sales-limited). In-transit=1918 100% ghost (historical losses ~60% recent, confirmed P24 lost, no arrivals P27-P30 despite prior orders; effective pipeline=0). No overdue expected (recent orders P25-P30=0). Low params ensure low base_stock <<3115 pipe \u2192 order=0, minimizes new holding cost amid low demand/seasonal drop; recent_5 captures sustained low regime (length=5>=3).

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime strengthened P26-P30 avg19 std~8.7 (sustained 5 periods, -73% mean/-75% vol vs P21-P25); P30 demand=6 confirms post-summer collapse

On-hand=1181 ample buffer (covers >60 periods at current mean), in-transit=1918 ~100% ghost per sustained high loss pattern (no arrivals P27-P31 despite pending older orders; recent successes LT=1-3 avg~2).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23): early fall transition for short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (women's summer basic); post-summer demand collapse sustained P26-P32 (7 periods: demands 27,18,17,27,6,16,14; mean=17.9, std=7.4; -73% vs P21-P25 summer avg81, low vol -65% vs prior 20). On-hand=1167 covers >60 periods at current mean; in-transit=1918 100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P32=6 periods straight, aligns with ~60% sustained loss rate; total confirmed lost >1700 prior). No new arrivals/lead time confirms in P32 conclude. Changepoint P26 low regime sustained/strengthened. L recent_5 (most recent arrivals LTs: P26=3, P23=2, P23=1, P22=2, P19=1; avg=1.8, reflects recent 1-3 variability vs promised 2). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 captures low mean/vol regime. Low base_stock ~17.9*(1+1.8) + z*7.4*sqrt(2.8) ~55-70 << pipeline~3085 ensures order=0 (capped policy), minimizes holding on bloated inv while amply covered; low params bridge ghost pipeline by suppressing orders despite backend's naive pipeline subtraction.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime strengthened P26-P32 avg 17.9 std 7.4 (sustained 7 periods, -73% mean/-65% vol vs P21-P25; P32=14 confirms fall drop); No arrivals P27-P32 (6 periods) confirms 100% ghost in-transit pattern (1918 units unreliable)

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): Late September, fall onset; short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (women's everyday basics) demand remains low post-summer collapse, as expected seasonally\u2014no uptick signals. Low regime changepoint at P26 sustained P26-P33 (8 periods): demands [27,18,17,27,6,16,14,28], avg=19.1, std=7.7 (sample); -73% mean/-65% vol vs prior P21-P25 high (avg81 std20). On-hand=1139 covers >50 periods low demand (~20/wk); in-transit=1918 100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P33, 7 periods; pattern per carry-over). Reconciled: ghosts bloat pipeline (backend sees high), no overdue beyond confirmed losses. L=default (promised 2; observed avg~1.7, recent mixed 1-3, no sustained shift). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=8 (regime_length=8, max(min(8,20),3); evidence: consistent low post-P26). Low params \u2192 low base_stock ~mu=3*19.1=57 +z*sigma~sqrt3*7.7=13 (z~1.64 for q=19/20), << on-hand+pipeline \u2192 order~0, minimizes holding on excess while covering low demand (service high via stockpile).

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime strengthened P26-P33 avg 19.1 std 7.7 (sustained 8 periods, -73% mean/-65% vol vs P21-P25 81/20); No arrivals extended P27-P33 (7 periods) confirms 1918 in-transit 100% ghost unreliable

LLM Rationale:

On-hand 1128 high (covers ~60 periods at avg18 demand), depleting slowly (P26:1265 to P34:1128, -137 over 8p); in-transit 1918 100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P34 8 periods, pattern sustained). Pipeline bloated by ghosts, OR will order 0 regardless (base_stock <<3046 pipeline). Use L default=2 (observed recent LTs avg~1.8-2, e.g. last5:3,2,1,2,1); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_9 for low regime (mu_hat~(1+2)*18.2=54.7, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*7.7~13.4, base_stock~54+1.6*13~75 low to match service/holding balance, prevents overorder amid excess on-hand & ghost bloat).

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime strengthened P26-P34 avg 18.2 std 7.7 (sustained 9 periods, -73% mean/-65% vol vs P21-P25 81/20); No arrivals extended P27-P34 (8 periods) confirms 1918 in-transit 100% ghost unreliable

Parameters use 'calculate' for L (avg observed LT~1.7 to inform backend), 'recent_N' N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (low regime, regime_length=10; N=max(min(10,20),3)=10) yielding low \u03bc\u0302=(1+~1.7)*18.8\u224847, low \u03c3\u0302=\u221a(2.7)*8.2\u224813. Low base_stock~47 + 1.64*13\u224870 (q=19/20=0.95, z\u22481.64) << pipeline 3022 ensures order=0, minimizes holding on bloated/ghost inventory while prepared for low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime strengthened P26-P35 avg 18.8 std 8.2 (sustained 10 periods, -73% mean/-60% vol vs P21-P25 peak 81/20); No arrivals extended P27-P35 (9 periods) confirms 1918 in-transit 100% ghost unreliable

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21): Late October, fall season for short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (summer-oriented); sustained low demand regime since P26 (2019/8/5) confirmed further by P36 demand=10, avg P26-P36=18.0 (11 periods, -73% vs summer peak P21-P25 avg81), low vol std~7.8 (-60% vs peak). On-hand=1094 covers ~60 periods of low demand (~18/wk), in-transit=1918 100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P36=10 periods, pattern sustained). High bloated pipeline prevents backend ordering (base_stock << pipeline). Use recent_11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect low regime (changepoint P26 sustained 11+ periods, N=11=min(regime,20)); L=default (promised 2, losses not LT drift). Keeps base_stock low ~ (3*18)+z*(sqrt3*7.8)~54 + 1.64*13.5~77 <<3012 pipeline, order=0 optimal to avoid holding costs while servicing demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime strengthened P26-P36 avg 18.0 std~7.8 (sustained 11 periods, -73% mean/-60% vol vs P21-P25 peak 81/20); No arrivals extended P27-P36 (10 periods) confirms 1918 in-transit 100% ghost unreliable

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Late October, short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (summer-appropriate, low relevance to Halloween/fall). Low demand regime sustained P26-P37 (12 periods): demands avg 17.5, std ~8 (-73% mean/-60% vol vs summer peak P21-P25 avg81 std20), confirmed by P37 demand=12. On-hand 1082 ample for >60 periods low demand (holding cost concern but no stockout risk). In-transit 1918=100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P37, 11 periods; historical loss rate >50% sustained). Pipeline bloat ensures backend orders ~0 regardless. Use recent_N N=12 (regime length=12<=20) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low forecast over (1+L) periods; L=default (promised 2, observed avg~1.7 but irrelevant as no order needed). Parameters balance high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding by reflecting low demand/vol, preventing overorder amid ghost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime strengthened P26-P37 avg17.5 std~8 (sustained 12 periods, -73% mean/-60% vol vs P21-P25 peak); No arrivals extended P27-P37 (11 periods) confirms 1918 in-transit 100% ghost unreliable

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4): early November, fall/winter transition; short-sleeved cotton jersey dress expects continued low demand (no holiday relevance for summer-style garment). Low demand regime P26-P38 (13 periods: demands 27,18,17,27,6,16,14,28,11,24,10,12,16; avg=17.4, std=7.1) sustained post-summer collapse (-73% mean/-60% vol vs P21-P25 peak 81/20), changepoint at P26 confirmed by 13p consistency. On-hand=1066 ample (~61 periods at avg demand), covers (L+1)p easily; in-transit=1918 100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P38, 12p streak confirms unreliability, prior losses >70%). No new overdue (no recent orders). Use default L=2 (observed avg~1.8, promised match); recent_N=13 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low base_stock ~ (1+2)*17.4 + z* sqrt(3)*7.1 ~52 + 1.65*12.3~72 << pipeline~3000, ensures 0 order to minimize holding on excess inventory while service high.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime strengthened P26-P38 avg 17.4 std 7.1 (sustained 13 periods, -73% mean/-60% vol vs P21-P25 peak); No arrivals extended P27-P38 (12 periods) confirms 1918 in-transit 100% ghost unreliable

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11): Singles' Day in China (CN Unique product), potential major demand spike for apparel, but no prior evidence in data and sustained low demand regime P26-P39 (14 periods, avg 17.1, std ~7.5) with P39=13 fitting low pattern; short-sleeved cotton jersey dress in Nov aligns with seasonal low post-summer. On-hand 1053 covers >50 low-demand periods or multiple past peaks (max 232); in-transit 1918=100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P39, 13 periods, prior losses sustained). No recent LT observations (last P26 LT=3). High effective inv_pos (real on-hand) + bloated pipeline ensures backend orders 0 under low params (ideal now to avoid more ghost bloat/holding while depleting excess). Use default L (promised 2); recent_N=14 mu_hat/sigma_hat for low regime changepoint at P26 (length=14<=20), keeps base_stock ~(3*17.1 + z*7.5*sqrt(3)) ~80 <2971 inv_pos, order=0 balancing low demand/holding vs service (safe buffer).

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime strengthened P26-P39 avg 17.1 std 7.5 (sustained 14 periods, -73% mean/-60% vol vs P21-P25 peak 81/20); No arrivals extended P27-P39 (13 periods) confirms 1918 in-transit 100% ghost unreliable

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18): Pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday, but short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (summer/everyday) aligns with sustained low demand regime since changepoint P26 (post-summer peak), P26-P40 avg 17.5 (sum=263/15), std\u22488.2 (carry-over ~7.5 prior, slight vol up but sustained low). On-hand=1029 covers 50+ periods demand; in-transit=1918 confirmed 100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P40, 14 periods). No new overdue flags. L=default (promised 2) as LT observations sparse/mixed (avg~1.7 all-time, recent unreliable due to losses). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=15 (regime_length=15, max(3,min(15,20))) reflects low mean/vol, yielding low base_stock << ghost pipeline ensuring order=0 to minimize holding on excess on-hand while covering low demand service.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime strengthened P26-P40 avg 17.5 std 8.2 (sustained 15 periods, -73% mean/-60% vol vs P21-P25 peak 81/20); No arrivals extended P27-P40 (14 periods) confirms 1918 in-transit 100% ghost unreliable

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Late November, Thanksgiving week/approaching Black Friday (Nov 29), but short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (summer-style everyday basic) unlikely to spike; sustained low demand regime from P26-P41 (16 periods, avg 17.1, std ~8.2, -73% mean/-60% vol vs prior peak), P41=10 confirms continuation. On-hand=1019 covers ~60 periods demand, in-transit=1918 confirmed 100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P41, 15 periods). No new arrivals or lead-time observes. Reconcile: effective pipeline=0, high on-hand avoids stockouts. Set L default (promised 2, observed successful avg~1.7); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=16 (regime_length=16>=3, changepoint P26 sustained) for low mu~51/sigma~23 over L+1=3, base_stock low ~65 << ghost pipeline, OR orders ~0 balancing low holding vs service (covered by on-hand).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2): Early December, Christmas holiday season approaching (Dec 25); Black Friday bump in P42 demand=57 (+230% vs P26-P41 avg~17); potential uptick in basic dress sales but short-sleeved limits winter appeal, historical winter demand ~50s. On-hand=962 ample for remaining 5 periods (43-47) even at 100+/period (total ~500 <962). In-transit=1918 100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P42=16 periods, pattern sustained); no recent orders so no overdues. Low demand regime P26-P42 sustained 17 periods (avg 19.4, std~11.8 confirmed via calc); use recent_N N=17 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect low mean/vol (mu~(1+2)*19.4=58.2, sigma~sqrt(3)*11.8~20.4, base~58+1.6*20~91 <<2880 pos, order=0). L default (promised 2, aligns with historical avg~1.7). Prevents ghost bloat, relies on on-hand to cover demand spikes w/o excess holding ($1/unit low penalty vs profit $19).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), pre-Christmas (P46 ~12/23 Christmas week), but short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (summer-ish everyday basic) unlikely to see sustained holiday spike; recent P42-P44 demands 57/57/16 (Thanksgiving/early Dec blips, avg 43 but P44=16 low confirms no shift). Sustained low demand regime from changepoint P26 (post-summer -73% mean vs P21-P25 avg81, sustained 19 periods P26-P44 avg~19 std~12 including recent spikes; evidence: consistent teens except outliers). On-hand 889 covers remaining 3 periods even at 100+/period; in-transit 1918=100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P44, 18 periods). Pipeline bloated, so set low mu_hat/sigma_hat via recent_19 (regime length 19, N=max(min(19,20),3)=19) for base_stock << position (~2807), ensuring order=0 to avoid adding inventory amid high holding costs. L default (promised 2) as losses are total ghosting not LT drift, no order placed anyway. Parameters balance low service need vs holding by reflecting current low regime/vol.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23, Christmas week): sustained low demand regime from P26-P45 (20 periods, avg demand 21.2, std ~12 including holiday bumps P42-P43=57 then revert to P44-P45 avg 18); initial winter samples avg~52 suggest possible Christmas uptick for basic dress but recent data dominates. On-hand 869 covers 40+ periods at 20/unit demand; in-transit 1918 100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P45=19 periods, pattern sustained). No overdue shipments beyond confirmed ghosts. Use default L=2 (observed avg LT~1.8 from 10 successes). recent_N=20 for mu_hat/sigma_hat reflects regime length=20, low mean/vol to keep base_stock low (~3*21 +1.6*sqrt(3)*12 ~85 << IP=2787), backend orders ~0 avoiding bloat while high service q=0.95 prepares for future depletion; balances low holding drawdown vs potential unmet demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas/New Year's week for short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (summer-oriented everyday basic); demand expected low continuing sustained low regime from P26-P46 (21 periods, avg~20.6 std~16 with holiday spikes P42/P43=57 not sustained as P44-P46 avg~15 std~5 drop back to regime). On-hand=860 covers >>40 periods at 20/wk; in-transit=1918 100% ghost (no arrivals P27-P46=20 periods, pattern sustained). Pipeline=2778 bloated; set mu_hat/sigma_hat to recent_20 (regime length=21>20 cap, changepoint P26 confirmed by carry-over/20+ low periods vs prior peaks) for low base_stock~(3*20.25 + 1.645*sqrt(3*~16))~85 <<2778 ensuring order=0, depletes on-hand under holding cost without adding ghost bloat. L default (promised=2, no new LT evidence; historical avg~1.7, recent sparse avg~2). Bridges losses by low params preventing overorder.
