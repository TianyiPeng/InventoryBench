  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: No arrivals in P27-46 (20+ periods), confirming sustained effective pipeline=0 pattern with 620u in-transit lost (consistent with carry-over: no arrivals P27-41+). Promised LT=2 irrelevant due to total loss pattern. Inventory position: On-hand=141 (from P46 end), covers 10+ periods at recent low demand avg~15 (P44-46:16/20/9). No expected arrivals for P47. Demand analysis: Post-Thanksgiving/Christmas low sustained into late Dec (P44-46 avg15, P46=9; extends post-summer downtrend -90% vs summer peaks). Product is short-sleeved cotton jersey dress - minimal winter/New Year's demand driver on 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas slump). Historical pre-game Jan demand ~50 irrelevant to current winter low regime. OR recommendation: 0 units (uses promised LT=2, all-history demand; aligns with low recent samples and high on-hand). Strategy: Follow OR at 0 - prioritize drawing down excess inventory to minimize holding costs ($1/u/p), no stockout risk with 141u buffer vs expected ~10-20 demand.",
