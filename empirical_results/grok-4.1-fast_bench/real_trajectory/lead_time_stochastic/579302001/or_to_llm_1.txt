Demand analysis: Christmas peak 2019/12/16 (Monday before Dec 25), lingerie gift demand high; recent P44=232 (record high), P43=98, P42=68 (avg P42-P44=133, +317% vs P37-P41 avg32); surge counters post-BTS drop, aligns with calendar holiday uplift for women's underwear/bras. Historical peaks ~150-200 in summer/BTS, but holiday likely higher/sustained 2-3 more periods (P45-P47). OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history (ignores losses, seasonality, recent surge) - its base-stock sees high pipeline vs historical mean ~80, correctly caps at 0. Strategy: Follow OR 0 - no need to order with ample coverage (173 on-hand + expected P45 arrivals ~500 + remaining 900+ pipeline) for (L+1)=3 periods at 200-250 demand; avoids adding to holding costs/loss risk. q=19/20=0.95 supports caution but pipeline buffers stockouts.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent concluded arrivals show variability (P45: P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2; P43: P40 LT=3, P41 LT=2), consistent with promised LT=2 but occasional LT=3; no new losses confirmed recently (last noted P24 order); in-transit 933 units likely from recent orders like P44=0, P45=0, but earlier pipeline filling (e.g., potential P46 arrivals from P44 LT=2=0, P45 LT=1 unlikely, P43 LT=3=46-43=3 possible 200 if LT=3). Inventory analysis: On-hand 497 + in-transit 933 = 1430 units total pipeline, ample for 7-10 periods at recent avg demand ~150-200; recent ending inventories high (P45:497), no stockouts. Demand analysis: Christmas Eve (2019/12/23) peak holiday surge for women's lingerie/bra (gift category); recent P44=232, P45=176 (avg 204, +53% vs P42-P43 avg 83), extending carry-over holiday surge confirmation (P42-P44 avg133, now P42-P45 avg144 over 4 periods); expect P46 demand 200-300+, but post-Christmas P47+ drop anticipated (historical post-event normalizations like post-back-to-school). OR recommendation: 0 units (appropriate given high inventory and OR's historical demand underestimating recent surge but capping aggressively). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - current pipeline covers holiday peak (497 on-hand handles 2+ periods high demand) + incoming arrivals + post-holiday normalization; adding more risks high holding costs ($1/unit/period) on excess post-Dec25; monitor P46 conclude for any pipeline shortfalls/lost shipments.",
