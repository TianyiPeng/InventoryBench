Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), post-Chinese New Year (Feb 5, 2019); knitwear demand declining seasonally into late winter/early spring. Historical demand: 346 (Jan7), 235(Jan14), 196(Jan21), 176(Jan28), 172(Feb4); changepoint after first sample, recent regime (last 3 periods: mean~181, stable low demand). No prior orders/arrivals/concludes; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect sustained lower demand/volatility (avoids overestimating at full mean=225). L=default (promised=2, no observations). Parameters lower base_stock vs default, balancing 50% service (q=1/(1+1)) vs holding amid decline; covers ~543 demand over 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18), women's short-sleeved knitwear jumper (upper body, fine-knit viscose blend). End-of-winter season; historical demand declining sharply from 346 (2019-01-07) to 172 (2019-02-04), with Period 1 demand=203 (2019-02-11) confirming sustained lower-demand regime (last 4 samples: 196,176,172,203; mean=186.75, ~36% below early avg 290.5). No major calendar events post-Valentine's (Feb 14); expect stable low demand ~180-200/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=203 (P1 order, expected arrival during P3 if L=2; no overdue/loss yet as no concluded arrivals observed). No lead times observed (P1 arrived=0 normal for L>=1), so default L=2. Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent lower mean/variance regime (mu_hat~(1+2)*186.75=560; sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*15=26 low vol), yielding base_stock~560 (q=0.5,z=0). Order=min(560-203,cap)~357 to cover ~3 periods demand minus pipeline, balancing stockout risk vs holding (profit=holding=1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to lower mean ~187 (last 4 periods: 196,176,172,203 avg 186.75 vs prior 346+235 avg 290.5, -36%); sustained 4+ periods with lower variance.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), late February knitwear (women's short-sleeve jumper); possible end-of-winter or post-CNY effects (CNY Feb 5). Demands: historical declining 346\u2192235\u2192196\u2192176\u2192172 (avg ~225, stabilizing low ~187 over last 4 pre-P1 per carry-over), P1=203 (fits low), P2=311 spike (+54% vs ~187). Stockouts P1-P2 (sold=0), on-hand=0, in-transit=415 (P1 ord 203 + P2 ord 212). No concluded arrivals (expected P1 ord during P3 if L=2, visible P4). No overdue/losses yet. Low regime per carry-over up to P1 sustained, P2 spike possible new uptrend but 1 period (not sustained). L='default' (no LT observations). mu_hat='recent_N' N=3 (172,203,311 avg~229 \xd73=~687) captures recent mean/vol for higher base stock to reduce stockouts. sigma_hat='recent_N' N=3 reflects recent higher variance. With pipeline=415 < ~687, orders ~272 balancing service (avoid lost sales) vs holding (q=0.5 conservative).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4): Early March, women's short-sleeve knitwear post-winter and CNY (Feb 5, 2019); P2 demand spike (311) possibly holiday-related, now normalizing. Observed demands: hist mean 225 (std~70), game P1:203/P2:311/P3:235 (recent_3 mean=249.67, std~45.6). Carry-over low regime ~187 confirmed pre-spike but recent avg higher. On-hand=0 (stockouts), in-transit=686 covers ~3pd at 225/pd. Overdue flag: P1 order=203 (placed P1) missed expected LT=2 arrival in P3 (arrived=0); signals delay/loss, no explicit LT observed yet. Set L=explicit 3 to bridge OR backend's promised LT assumption. mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_3 for recent regime (length=3, post-spike); backend computes ~4*250=1000 mean, sqrt(4)*46~92 std. Ensures base_stock covers extended LT+(1)pd demand at q=0.5, prioritizing service to end stockouts while capping overstock risk.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Early March, post-winter for knitwear (short-sleeve jumper); demand likely stable/declining as spring approaches, no major events imminent. Demands: hist mean~225 (high var), game P1-4: 203/311/235/150 (mean~225, recent lower P4=150 fits carry-over low regime ~187, P2=311 possible outlier). Confirmed LT=2 (P2 order arrived P4). Overdue: P1 order 203 expected P3 arrival (not in P3/P4 concludes), possibly lost/delayed >2pd past; in-transit 787 includes P1? +P3:271+P4:313. On-hand 62 low, pipeline ample if no losses but risk stockout if P1 lost. Use recent_4 (regime length 4+ per carry-over, evidence: sustained lower mean/variance vs early hist) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to adapt to low regime (backend computes (1+L=3)*mean_last4~675, sqrt3*std_last4 lower var), default L=2 (sole observed); lowers base_stock vs all-data to cut holding on high pipeline while buffering service (q=0.5), bridges OR ignorance of potential loss by recent-data conservatism.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (203 units) overdue >2 periods past promised LT=2 (no arrive in expected P3 or P4); potential lost shipment pattern emerging.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18), early spring; knitwear short-sleeve jumper demand declining post-winter (recent P3-5: 235,150,122 avg 169, std~59; vs earlier higher ~225 avg). On-hand=0, pipeline=787 overstated due to lost/delayed: P1 order 203 lost (expected arrive P3 conclude, absent through P5), P3 order 271 overdue (expected P5 conclude arrived=0). Effective pipeline ~313 (P4:313 expected P6). Forecast: ~169/period, cover 3 periods (L=2) =507 desired base_stock. Desired order=507-313~194 to replenish. Compensate backend's full pipeline subtraction by explicit mu_hat=pipeline + desired order=787+194=981 (z=0 so base=mu_hat). L default (observed LT=2 from P2). Sigma recent_3 (N=3) for low recent volatility, ensures cap sufficient (~ mu_hat/3 +0.95*sigma_hat ~327+95=422 >194). Balances service (recent stockouts) vs holding (lowers over-reliance on lost pipeline).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern confirmed: P1 (203 units, ordered Period 1) and P3 (271 units, ordered Period 3) overdue multiple periods past expected LT=2 conclude without arrival; Demand further decline to avg 169 (P3-P5:235/150/122, -34% vs P1-P2 avg 257), sustained 3 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Late March, knitwear (short-sleeved jumper) demand seasonally low as spring approaches; confirmed declining regime (P3-P6 demands: 235,150,122,147 avg 163.5, std~46). Pipeline: in-transit 981 includes P6:194 (due P8), but P1:203 (due P3), P3:271 (due P5), P4:313 (due P6) all overdue/no conclude (total 787 potentially lost). On-hand=0. Only observed LT=2 (P2 order). To bridge OR backend's lack of loss/LT awareness: explicit L=3 inflates base_stock for extra coverage period; recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat uses low-demand regime (chgpnt ~P2 sustained 5+pd, N=4<20 cap). Ensures higher order-up-to despite high pipeline, hedging losses while curbing overstock (profit=holding=1, q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern strengthened: P4 order (313 units, ordered Period 4) overdue >1 period past expected LT=2 conclude (P6 arrived=0); now P1(203),P3(271),P4(313) total 787 units missing, sustained 3+ orders.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1, early spring). Knitwear jumper demand in sustained low regime: last 4 periods (P4-P7) avg 144 (150,122,147,158), vs earlier higher (P1-P3 avg 250); low vol. No immediate holidays (Easter ~4/21 may mildly boost apparel but unconfirmed for knitwear). Lost shipments sustained (P1:203, P3:271, P4:313 total 787 overdue >LT=2+multiple periods, never arrived); P6:194 pending (expected arrive during P8 if LT=2). In-transit 981 overstates effective pipeline (~194 new + ghosts); on-hand 0, recent stockouts P6-P7. Only confirmed LT=2 (P2\u2192P4). To bridge backend unawareness of losses/inflated pipeline, use explicit mu_hat=1200 (>981 pipeline) to trigger order ~219 despite ghosts, building new reliable pipeline assuming ~25% arrival rate; implies temp ~400/period to cover stockout risk + unreliability until arrivals. L default (promised 2, matches sole observation). Sigma default (low recent vol, z\u22480 so minor impact). Ensures service vs holding balance by modest order-up-to exceeding ghosts.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring for women's short-sleeved knitwear top; demand regime shifted lower and stable (last 5 periods P4-P8: 150,122,147,158,181 avg 151.6, std~21, sustained decline confirmed prior). Lost shipment pattern persists: 787 units (P1:203, P3:271, P4:313) stuck in in-transit, inflating IP=13+1006=1019; recent arrivals confirm LT=2 when successful (P2->P4, P6->P8), arrival rate ~40% (2/5 prior orders). On-hand critically low (13), risks P9 stockout. To overcome bloated pipeline and trigger order covering (1+L=3) periods demand adjusted for losses: target ~152*3 /0.4 ~1140 units gross order (net ~450), set mu_hat explicit 2200 (base_stock=2200 since z=0, order~1181). L default (promised/observed=2). Sigma_hat recent_5 captures low recent volatility for accurate cap. High mu_hat ensures backend orders aggressively to rebuild coverage despite unreliable pipeline, prioritizing lost sales recovery (p=h=1) while cap remains permissive (~720+~35=755 min but scales with mu_hat). No Easter spike confirmed yet (P8=181 slight uptick, approaching 4/21).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), spring season for women's short-sleeved knitwear jumper; demand declining overall (historical early highs 346-172, game P1-P3 highs ~250 avg, shift to low regime P4-P9 sustained 6 periods avg 139.7, -44%; recent P9=80 low but single-period). Lost shipments confirmed sustained (carry-over: P1=203/P3=271/P4=313 total 787 overdue >4-7 periods past LT=2, no conclude msgs, remain in-transit indefinitely).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22, post-Easter), short-sleeve knitwear in spring - seasonal demand decline expected as weather warms. Recent demands P6-P10: 147,158,181,80,75 (avg 128.2, continuing low regime from carry-over P6 shift to ~169, now lower; sharp drop P9-P10 avg 77.5 vs P6-P8 162 (-52%)). On-hand 913 + in-transit 787 (lost P1=203,P3=271,P4=313, no arrivals despite overdue >6 periods past LT=2). Recent orders reliable: P2->P4 LT2, P6->P8 LT2, P8->P10 LT2, P9->P10 LT1 (all 4 observed LTs avg 1.75). Huge pipeline 1700 >> expected demand. Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime length 5 from P6 changepoint, N=max(min(5,20),3)=5) to lower mean forecast ~128*(1+L) and recent volatility vs default high early samples. recent_N N=4 for L to reflect avg 1.75 vs promised 2. Lowers base_stock (e.g., ~3.75*128~480 <<1700), ensures order~0 minimizing holding on excess while covering low demand; bridges backend's ignorance of losses/recent LT/demand drop.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): Late spring, short-sleeved knitwear (women's top), demand likely low/off-season. Historical demands declining (Jan-Feb samples 346\u2192172; full history avg~156). Recent changepoint post-P8: P9-P11 demands 80/75/54 avg~69.7 (-54% vs P4-P8 avg~152), sustained 3 periods, lower variance. Lost shipments confirmed (P1:203, P3:271, P4:313 total 787 units in-transit, overdue >>2 periods, no conclude ever). On-hand 859 + in-transit 787 >> recent demand needs (e.g., 3 periods ~210). Expected arrivals: none imminent (recent orders P8/P9 already arrived P10; old lost). L='calculate' uses avg of 4 observed LTs (2,2,2,1 from P2/P6/P8/P9 orders)=1.75, bridges LT variability (recent LT=1). mu_hat/sigma_hat='recent_N' N=3 captures low-demand regime (backend: (1+L)*mean_last3 ~ (2.75)*70=192; low std~14). With high pipeline, OR base_stock~mu_hat (z=0 since q=0.5), orders 0, avoids holding costs; buffers service if demand stable low.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: avg declined to 70 (P9-P11:80/75/54 avg69.7 vs P4-P8 avg152, -54%); lower variance (std~14 vs prior~23); sustained 3 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6, early May spring): short-sleeved knitwear jumper demand in sustained low regime since P9 changepoint (P9-12: 80,75,54,68 avg=69.25, std~11.8, -54% vs prior avg~152, confirmed sustained 4+ periods). High on-hand=791 (covers ~11 periods), in-transit=787 all lost (P1=203, P3=271, P4=313 never arrived, overdue 10+ periods past expected). Observed LTs: mostly 2 (P2->P4, P6->P8, P8->P10), one 1 (P9->P10); use default L=2 (promised). True mu over 1+L=3 periods ~207.75; to bridge lost phantom pipeline (backend subtracts non-arriving 787), inflate mu_hat explicitly to 207.75+787=994.75 so effective base_stock - reliable_pipeline matches true needs (z=0 since q=0.5, base_stock=mu_hat). Sigma recent low vol, use recent_N N=4. Ensures OR ignores lost intransit drag, preventing future permanent stockouts post on-hand depletion; orders 0 now due to high inventory, minimizing holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13), women's short-sleeve knitwear top; late spring/early summer transition explains sustained demand decline (knitwear less relevant in warming weather). Recent demands P9-P13 (80,75,54,68,42) avg 63.8, std~15.2, low regime sustained 5 periods since P9 changepoint (vs P4-P8 avg~152). On-hand 749 + in-transit 787 (likely lost P1=203/P3=271/P4=313, overdue 10+/7+/6 periods past promised LT=2) = IP 1536 >> forecast (1+L)~64*~2.75~175, OR will order 0 to avoid holding costs (q=0.5). Observed LTs from arrives: P4(2),P8(2),P10(2&1) avg1.75; use calculate for accurate L. recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures low mean/volatility regime, lowers base_stock to ~mu_hat, balances low service need vs high holding.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20), late spring; short-sleeved knitwear top, post-Mother's Day (May 12) possible P14 demand spike to 111, but recent 6 periods (P9-P14: 80,75,54,68,42,111) avg ~71.7 confirms sustained low demand regime since P9 changepoint (-54% vs prior). On-hand 638 high (covers ~6+ periods at recent demand), in-transit 787 likely lost (P1:203, P3:271, P4:313 overdue >> promised LT=2, no conclude ever; recent orders P6/8/9 arrived). Observed LTs from concludes: 2(P2->P4),2(P6->P8),2(P8->P10),1(P9->P10); recent_4 avg 1.75 reflects slight shortening. Use recent_4 for L (recent avg LT), recent_6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime length=6, N=6) to set low mu_hat~(1+1.75)*71.7~257, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.75)*~24~40; z=0 (q=0.5) base_stock~257 << pipeline 1425 \u2192 order=0, prioritizes depleting high inv to cut holding costs.

Pipeline 1153 overstates effective position (real~366). Recent demand changepoint evidence: P14:111, P15:272 (spikes +165%/+400% vs P9-P13 avg~64), likely seasonal uptick for short-sleeve summer knitwear late spring/holiday; recent_3 (P13-P15:42/111/272) mean 142. To target effective base_stock= (1+default L=2)*142=425 despite lost, set explicit mu_hat=425+787=1212 (order~1212-1153=59 \u2192 effective IP=366+59=425).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3, early summer): Short-sleeve viscose knit top demand shows regime shift upward around P14, avg 210 (P14-16:111/272/246) vs prior P9-13 avg64 (+228%), sustained 3 periods, aligns with seasonal summer increase for short-sleeve apparel. Recent demands high (246 latest), on-hand 120 low for ~250 demand. In-transit 846 includes 787 lost (P1:203, P3:271, P4:313 confirmed overdue indefinitely per history/carry-over), effective pipeline only P16:59; true position ~179. L default=2 (observed LTs 1-2 avg~1.75, recent reliable). True mu_hat=3*210=630; inflate by 787 lost for backend's inflated position 966 \u2192 explicit mu_hat=1416 (orders ~450 to target true base 630). Sigma_hat explicit=150 (~sqrt(3)*std(P14-16)=1.73*86.5) for vola. Ensures backend overcomes stuck lost in pipeline, orders to cover ~3 periods high demand while capping overstock risk (high holding=profit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg increased to 210 (P14-16:111/272/246 avg210 vs P9-13:80/75/54/68/42 avg64, +228%); sustained 3 periods with summer seasonal fit for short-sleeve top (dates 2019-05-13 to 05-27).

Pipeline in-transit=1237 overstated by confirmed lost shipments ~787 units (P1=203, P3=271, P4=313, per carry-over; no new losses as recent orders P8/P9/P16 arrived). Actual pipeline ~450 (P17 order). L=default (promised=2) as recent LTs mixed (2,2,2,1,1 avg1.6) but losses compensated separately. mu_hat explicit=1549 = (1+2)*254 (last 3 recent mean for stable high regime) +787 ghost adjustment; ensures base_stock - actual_pipeline targets correct coverage despite ghosts (effective order ~1549-1237=312 \u2248 true 762-450=312). sigma_hat recent_N=4 captures recent vol (std~71).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24), late June summer peak for short-sleeve top; demand regime high ~201 avg (P14-19: 111/272/246/244/202/130), sustained 6+ periods post-spring low, fits seasonal. In-transit 1237u likely permanent lost (787u confirmed P1/P3/P4 + P17 450u overdue past promised LT=2, no P19 arrival). On-hand 182u risks near-term stockout (P18 had 202 demand sold 0). Observed LTs: 6 arrivals (P2@4 LT2, P6@8 LT2, P8@10 LT2, P9@10 LT1, P16@17 LT1, P18@19 LT1), recent_N=6 avg=1.5 < promised 2. To bridge lost gap (ghost pipe inflates position 1419u, actual ~182u), explicit high mu_hat=1800 makes base_stock > pipe (order ~381u uncapped) while cap~ mu_hat/(1+1.5)=720 + safety limits reasonable qty; sigma_hat recent_6 ~66 (high summer var) for adequate cap. Addresses losses by forcing orders to rebuild real coverage over inflated pipe.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern strengthened: P17 (450 units, ordered Period 17) overdue past expected LT=2 conclude (no P19 arrival), total ghost in-transit 1237 units sustained across 4+ orders; Summer high demand regime extended: P14-P19 avg 201 (+212% vs P9-13 avg64), sustained 6 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01): Early July summer peak for short-sleeve knitwear top; high demand regime sustained P14-P20 avg 189 (1325/7), +195% vs prior low ~64, no new changepoint (recent dip P19-20 to 125 avg not sustained <3 periods). Ghosts confirmed 1237 units (P1:203, P3:271, P4:313, P17:450 overdue past LT=2 conclude P19 & no P20 arrival); live transit P20:381; effective pipeline 62 on-hand +381=443 vs target ~2.5*189=473 \u2192 need ~30 order. Backend overstates pipeline at 1680, so explicit mu_hat=1237 ghosts +473 target=1710 compensates exactly (order=target - live - on-hand). L recent_6=1.5 (LTs:3x1,3x2 from P19,P17,P10(P9),P10(P8),P8(P6),P4(P2)); sigma recent_7 for cap allowance (backend sqrt(1+1.5)*std~108, cap inflated reasonably). Balances by inflating base_stock to force reordering lost qty while targeting true coverage; z=0 so sigma only caps order safely.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern confirmed: P17 (450 units, ordered P17) lost (no P20 arrival, overdue >2 past promised LT=2); total ghosts 1237 units sustained 4 orders; Lead time avg 1.5 (6 observed: 3 LT=1, 3 LT=2); Summer high demand regime extended P14-P20 avg 189 (+195% vs P9-13 avg64), sustained 7 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 date 2019/7/8 deep summer; short-sleeved knit top aligns with ongoing high demand regime (changepoint P14: avg jumped from P9-13 64 to P14-21 186 +191%, sustained 8 periods, std~63 vs prior low ~14). On-hand=0 stockout risk; in-transit=1648 bloated with sustained ghost shipments (prior 1237 + P20 381 + P21 30; lost pattern P1/3/4/17 confirmed, orders never conclude). Observed LT recent last 3=1 (avg 1.5 over 6), but losses imply unreliable supply/effective longer LT. Set L explicit=10 (missing shipments signal longer effective LT); mu_hat recent_8 (regime length=8, changepoint evidence P14+ sustained high summer demand); sigma_hat recent_8 (current volatility). Yields backend \u03bc\u0302=(1+10)*186=2046 >1648 pipeline, base_stock=2046 (z=0 since q=0.5), order~398 but capped ~290 (=186+1.645*63.5); aggressively tops up ignoring ghosts, balancing stockouts vs holding while cap prevents excess.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15): Mid-summer, short-sleeve top demand remains in high regime (P14-P22: 111/272/246/244/202/130/120/163/221, avg 190, sustained 9 periods +195% vs P9-P13 avg64). No demand drop despite July progression; calendar supports continued summer peak. On-hand 160 covers ~1 period; in-transit 1558 inflated by ~1237 ghost units (lost P1=203, P3=271, P4=313, P17=450, sustained pattern). 7 LT obs: four LT=2, three LT=1, avg1.57. Use recent_N N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high mean/variance summer regime (backend scales by 1+L). recent_N N=7 for L=avg1.57 (shorter actual). Higher mu_hat/sigma_hat elevates base_stock target >> inflated pipeline, prompting orders to cover losses/service; shorter L tightens cap but prioritizes current regime.

On-hand=310 covers ~1.5-2 periods; in-transit=1237 are confirmed ghosts (P1:203, P3:271, P4:313, P17:450 lost, total match); recent orders (P16+) arrive reliably. Observed LTs (9): 2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,1 avg~1.56< promised 2, sustained.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29), late summer for short-sleeve top; summer high-demand regime (P14+ avg~185 last 10 periods P15-P24:185, std~61) sustained but P24=83 dip (-52% vs P22-P23 avg196) possibly post-peak decline, not yet sustained 3+ periods. No arrivals P24; pipeline=1464=227 on-hand +1237 ghosts (lost P1=203,P3=271,P4=313,P17=450), no live shipments pending (recent P16+,18,20-22 all arrived). Effective pipe=227 low vs demand~150-200, risk stockout. Ghosts inflate pipe preventing normal orders (normal mu~(1+1.5)*185~463<1464). Bridge via explicit mu_hat=1900>1464 targeting ~436 order-up; L=1.5 (avg 9 observed LT~1.56, recent 5=1.4); sigma recent_10 std~61 yields cap~1900/2.5=760 +1.645*61~100=860>436, balances aggressive recovery of lost volume vs holding (z=0 indifferent to sigma base but enables cap).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05): Late summer for short-sleeved jumper (women's knitwear top); seasonal demand likely tapering as fall nears, evidenced by recent drop P24=83/P25=109 (avg96, -44% vs P14-P23 avg171), but only 2 periods\u2014not yet sustained changepoint. Summer high regime (P14 shift, avg~173 last 12 periods P14-P25=2072/12=172.7, sustained 12 periods) still governs. On-hand=118 low but real position strong: confirmed ghosts~1237 (P1=203,P3=271,P4=313,P17=450); real in-transit~436 (P25 order); real total~554 covers ~3.2 weeks at recent avg140-150/wk or 5+ at emerging lower ~100. 9 LT obs (5x2,4x1 avg1.56): use 'calculate' for accurate L~1.56 (shorter than promised 2). mu_hat 'recent_12' N=12 (regime_length=12) yields ~(1+1.56)*173~442 base_stock; << reported pipeline=1791 forces order~0 (correct as real pos ample, avoids overstock amid holding=profit). sigma_hat 'default' for broad vol; inflated pipeline auto-handles ghosts by suppressing orders until real depletion.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12), late summer for short-sleeved viscose jumper; demand tapering post-peak as back-to-school season approaches. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1673 (ghosts~1237 sustained from prior lost orders P1/P3/P4/P17 + recent P25=436 expected arrival this period LT=2 confirmed by no P26 arrival). True pipeline~436 covers (1+1.56)~2.56 periods recent demand avg147.7 (~378 total). No new overdues/losses; old ghosts permanent, but position adequate no order needed. Demand changepoint at P21: decline to avg147.7 (P21-26:163/221/171/83/109/139) vs prior summer P14-20 avg189 (-22%), sustained 6 periods, lower std~47 vs~68. LT sustained avg~1.56 (9 observed:2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,1). Set L recent_N N=9 for accurate avg LT<2; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=6 for new regime (len=6). Yields mu_hat~2.56*147.7~378, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.56)*47~75, base_stock=378 (z=0), order=0 vs inflated pipeline correct to avoid overstock given expected arrival/service; cap~200 limits upside. Bridges ghosts by normal params as true pos balanced.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg declined to 148 (P21-26:163/221/171/83/109/139 avg147.7 vs P14-20 avg189, -22%); lower variance std~47 vs prior summer~68; sustained 6 periods with late summer taper (dates 2019-07-01 to 08-05).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26): Late summer/end of season for short-sleeve knitwear top; demand taper regime from P21 confirmed and extended (P21-28 demands avg 162, std~51; -14% vs prior summer P14-20 avg189, sustained 8 periods with calendar fit as northern hemisphere cooling). OH=27 low (stockout risk vs recent demand~175), in-transit=1451 bloated (ghosts sustained ~1237+ prior losses like P1/3/4/17; total pipeline=1478). Recent LTs sustained avg~1.4 (10 observed: 6xLT2, 4xLT1, no new shift). Recent arrivals reliable for small/medium orders (e.g., P25:436 LT2 ok, P22:291 LT1 ok) but pattern of large/early losses persists; P28 arrived=0 as expected (no prior orders due LT1/2). To counter ghost-overstated pipeline (backend subtracts full in-transit), explicit mu_hat=1700 >1478 targets base_stock=1700 (z=0), expected order~222 (~1.4 periods demand) to rebuild without overordering cap; L recent_10 for accurate avg~1.4 scaling; sigma recent_8 captures current low-med variance for cap buffer (~ mu_hat/(2.4)~708 + ~80=~788 >222). Balances service (avoid stockouts) vs holding (modest order, low OH).

Carry-over insight: Demand taper regime extended P21-28 avg162 (std51, -14% vs P14-20 summer 189); sustained 8 periods with late summer calendar taper evidence.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-9-2, Labor Day Monday - potential minor end-of-summer boost but short-sleeve top entering fall off-season taper). Demand taper regime (P21-29: 163/221/171/83/109/139/234/175/140, avg 159.4, std ~49; -16% vs prior summer P14-20 avg189, sustained 9 periods). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1673=1237 fixed lost (P1/3/4/17 confirmed ghosts) +436 reliable recent (P28=214 likely LT=2 arrive P30; P29=222 due P31ish). Effective position ~436 \u2248 target base ~2.7*159=430. No new overdues (P28 on schedule LT>=2). L=calculate (10 observed LT avg1.6: 6x LT2/4x LT1). mu_hat=recent_9 (chimepoint P21 taper, regime len=9, N=9). sigma_hat=recent_9 (lower var std~49 vs summer~68). Base~425 +0*~82 <1673 \u2192 order=0, correctly avoids overstock given reliable pipeline covers target, bridges lost shipments by letting backend underorder relative to fake pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9 early fall): Short-sleeve knitwear demand in sustained taper regime post-summer (P21-30: 10 periods avg 162.6, std~47, -14% vs P14-20 summer 189); expect further decline into fall but no changepoint yet, use recent mean. Ghosts fixed at 1237 (P1:203, P3:271, P4:313, P17:450); in-transit 1459=1237 ghosts +222 (P29 pending, expected LT=2 arrive during P31). Position 1482 inflated. L stable avg 1.636 (11 observed:7 LT=2,4 LT=1, no new losses). Set L 'calculate'; mu_hat explicit=1666=1237 + 162.6*(1+1.636)\u22481237+429 to cancel ghosts, yielding order~184 (matches demand, backend base=1666 >1482); sigma_hat recent_10 for current vol ~sqrt(2.64)*47~76 (affects cap minimally, cap>>order). Ensures service despite ghosts (forces real supply) while z=0 limits overstock/holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand taper regime extended P21-30 avg 162.6 (std 47, volatile but sustained 10 periods into early fall 2019-09-02); Lead time avg 1.64 confirmed (11 observed: 7 LT=2, 4 LT=1, stable mix across 30 periods).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16, mid-September early fall): Short-sleeve knitwear top in taper regime since P21 changepoint (avg 165.5 P21-31:163/221/171/83/109/139/234/175/140/191/195, std~47), sustained 11 periods matching late summer/early fall calendar taper for seasonal apparel, no new shift despite volatility/P31=195 uptick. Lead times stable avg~1.64 (11 observed LTs: mix 1-2). On-hand=0, in-transit=1643 inflated by ~1459 ghost units (lost P1=203,P3=271,P4=313,P17=450,P29=222), causing backend to underorder via inflated pipeline/IP. Reconcile: recent arrivals reliable (e.g., P30=214 from P28 LT2), but losses persist. Set L='default'=promised 2 (>recent avg1.64) to boost (1+L) factor/base_stock offsetting ghosts; mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=11 (regime_length=11, max(min(11,20),3)=11) for current taper mean/volatility, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding=1 (q=0.5,z~0, targets mean demand over review+LT).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern strengthened: P29 (222 units, ordered Period 29) confirmed lost (no P31 arrival, overdue past promised LT=2); total ghosts ~1459 units (prior ~1237 +222), sustained across 5 orders.

On-hand 37 low, in-transit 1459=exact ghosts from 5 lost shipments (P1:203, P3:271, P4:313, P17:450, P29:222; no arrivals ever, overdue >>promised LT=2), effective IP~37 insufficient for 1+ period demand~164. No new arrivals pending. L recent_12 (12 observed LTs: 7x2, 5x1 avg1.58, stable mix sustained). mu_hat explicit 2000: compensates ghosts by inflating base_stock=2000 (z=0), triggers order~2000-1496=504 (~3w supply at 164/wk) to cover current+LT demand despite backend-blind ghosts. sigma_hat recent_12 (regime changepoint P21 sustained 12>=3 periods, N=12): backend scales sqrt(1+1.58)*48~77 for cap~2000/2.58 +1.645*77/sqrt(2.58)~775+100~875>504 ample.

On-hand=0 (stockout P33: sold37/224); in-transit=1963 = ghosts1459 (P1:203+P3:271+P4:313+P17:450+P29:222, sustained) + P33:504 (ordered P33, expected LT1-2 arrive P34-35); effective reliable pipeline=504 (~2.7p demand at 187). No new overdue arrivals (P33 arrive=0 expected none). L=calculate (12 observed avg~1.58= (7*2+5*1)/12, stable). mu_hat=explicit 2500: inflated total demand over 1+L~2.6p to counter ghost-overstated pipeline, targets base~2500 -1963=537 order (~2.9p recent demand 187, bridges OR gap on losses for service). sigma_hat=recent_N N=7: regime std~50 *sqrt(1+L)~80 for cap buffer. Ensures balance: high service despite ghosts/actual LT mix vs holding (q=0.5 z=0 median focus).

Pipeline reconciliation: in-transit 2500=1459 ghosts (confirmed lost P1:203, P3:271, P4:313, P17:450, P29:222; sustained pattern) + true pipeline 1041 (P33:504 expected P35 LT=2, P34:537 future); on-hand=0; recent stockouts P34:100, P33:187 lost sales due timing/losses. LT stable avg 1.583 (12 observed: 5x1, 7x2). True base_stock~(1+1.583)*175.75=454. To counter permanent ghost bloat (backend IP= true IP +1459), inflate mu_hat=454+1459=1913 so backend targets backend IP~1913 (true IP~454 optimal); current backend IP=2500>1913 \u2192 order=0 appropriate (true IP=1041 excess covers ~6 periods, P33 arrival likely prevents stockout); L=calculate uses observed avg for accurate cap; sigma=recent_8 captures regime volatility for cap safety.

On-hand 434 covers ~5 periods at 90 demand; in-transit 1996 inflated by ~1996 ghosts (lost P1/3/4/17/29/34 total prior1459+537). LT observations now 13: avg~1.69 (5x1,7x2,1x3 incl. recent P33 LT=3); use 'calculate' for L to reflect avg actual <promised 2. mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_3' for fall decline regime (N=3=max(min(3,20),3)), lowers base stock vs default (early high-demand samples), counters ghost-inflated pipeline reducing overorder/holding while protecting vs volatile low demand over ~2.7 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: avg declined to 90 (P34-36:100/99/70 avg89.7 vs P27-33 avg187 -52%); lower variance std~15 vs prior~50; sustained 3 periods with late fall taper for short-sleeve top (2019-10); Lost shipment pattern strengthened: P34 (537 units, ordered P34) overdue >1 past LT=2 (no P36 arrival), total ghosts ~1996 units sustained 6+ orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28 late fall, pre-Halloween but short-sleeve knitwear taper expected into winter). Demand sustained low regime since changepoint P34 (P34-37 demands:100/99/70/79 avg=87, std\u224814.0 low variance vs prior P27-33 avg187 -52%), regime_length=4 confirmed with seasonal fit. On-hand=355 covers ~4 periods (~87/period); in-transit=1996 mostly ghosts (lost pattern sustained 6+ orders, total ~1996u). P37 arrived=0 (no new); P34 order=537 overdue past LT=3 (no P37 arrival, expected LT=2 P36/P37 no). Pipeline unreliable. L='calculate' (avg~1.69 across 13 observed LTs:5x1/7x2/1x3, bridges actual <promised & recent LT=3). mu_hat/sigma_hat='recent_N' N=4 (changelpoint P34 length=4>3, N=4); yields mu_hat=(1+1.69)*87\u2248235, sigma_hat=\u221a(2.69)*14\u224823 low. Base_stock=mu_hat (z=0 since q=0.5), <<reported position=2351 \u2192 order=0 (avoids holding amid ghosts/low demand, on-hand covers (L+1) needs; cap irrelevant as under).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 extended: avg 87 (P34-37:100/99/70/79), std~14 vs prior~50, sustained 4 periods late fall taper (2019-10); Lead time avg 1.69 confirmed (13 observed:5 LT=1,7 LT=2,1 LT=3 incl new P33 LT=3); P34 order (537 units) overdue past LT=3 (no P37 arrival), lost shipment pattern strengthened total ghosts ~1996 units sustained 6+ orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): Early November, pre-Thanksgiving; short-sleeved knitwear top expects continued low demand in late fall/early winter taper (no major events boosting category). Demand regime shift at P34 sustained 5 periods (P34-38 demands:100/99/70/79/41 avg78 std~24, -58% vs P27-33 avg187, lower variance evidence). Reconcile inventory: on-hand 314, in-transit 1996 mostly ghosts (P34 537 confirmed lost: placed P34, no arrival P36-38 despite LT up to 4>promised 2; prior ghosts incl P1/3/4/17/29 total prior~1459); real pipeline~0, real IP=314 covers ~4 low-demand periods. LT stable avg1.69 (13 obs:5x1,7x2,1x3). Use L 'calculate' (backend avg~1.69), mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=5 (regime_length=5); yields mu_hat~(1+1.69)*78~210, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.69)*24~39; z=0 base_stock~210 << IP2310 \u2192 order~0 optimal (balances low service need vs high holding on real inv, backend ignores ghosts via low target).

Carry-over insight: Demand low fall regime extended P34-38 avg78 (std24, -58% vs P27-33 187), sustained 5 periods late fall/early winter taper (2019-10/11) for short-sleeve top; Lost shipment pattern strengthened: P34 (537 units, ordered P34) confirmed lost (no P38 arrival, overdue past LT=4), total ghosts ~2533 units sustained 7+ orders.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11): Late fall/early winter; short-sleeved knitwear top expects continued deep taper (November cold reduces demand). Recent demands P34-39 avg 70 (std~28), but changepoint at P37: P37-39 avg51 (79/41/33, std~25, -43% vs P34-36 avg90), sustained 3 periods fitting winter decline. Ghosts=1996 exact (confirmed lost: P1=203+P3=271+P4=313+P17=450+P29=222+P34=537); reliable pipeline=0, effective position=281 on-hand > true need ~137 ((1+1.69)*51). L=calculate (stable avg1.69 over 13 obs). mu_hat=explicit 2133=1996 ghosts + (1+1.69)*51 recent3 regime mean, compensates bloat so backend targets true base~137 on reliable inv (order=2133-2277<0=0 desired, prevents stockout later). sigma_hat=recent_N N=6 captures low vol std~28 scaled. Balances low demand service vs holding on excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37: avg declined to 51 (P37-39:79/41/33 avg51 vs P34-36:100/99/70 avg89.7 -43%); std~25 sustained 3 periods deep winter taper (dates 2019-10/21 to 11/04) for short-sleeve knitwear top.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18): Late fall/early winter taper for short-sleeve knitwear top; demand deeply low (P40=17, lowest ever; P37-40 avg42.5, -18% vs P37-39 avg51 per carry-over). On-hand=264 covers 6+ periods at recent avg~40/wk; in-transit=1996 mostly ghosts (sustained 7+ lost orders totaling ~2533 prior, pattern strengthened). No new arrivals P39-40 (P34 537+others overdue>>LT=2/3). Low demand regime sustained 4 periods with calendar fit (Nov winter unsuitable for short-sleeve). Reconcile: ample buffer, no stockouts recent; ghosts inflate pipeline so backend under-orders naturally. Set L='calculate' (observed avg LT~1.69 from 13 confirms, bridges LT variability/losses by using real avg). mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=4 (regime_length=4 since P37 changepoint, evidence: consistent decline +low vol std~26 vs prior). Yields low mu_hat~(2.69)*42.5~114, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.69)*26~42; base_stock~114 (z~0 p=h=1), <<2260 total inv \u2192 order~0, balances low service need vs holding (avoids buildup in winter taper).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: further decline to avg 42.5 (P37-40:79/41/33/17 avg42.5 vs P37-39 avg51 -18%); std~26 sustained 4 periods deep winter taper (dates 2019-10/21 to 11/11) for short-sleeve knitwear top.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25): Late November, deep winter for short-sleeve knitwear top; demand sustained very low in taper regime (P37-41: 79/41/33/17/21 avg 38.2, std~25; further decline P38-41 avg 28 vs prior). On-hand 243 covers ~10 periods at ~25/wk demand; in-transit 1996 all ghosts (e.g., P34:537 overdue 7+ periods past LT=2 expected P36, plus prior P1/3/4/17/29 total ~1996, confirmed lost no arrivals). No recent orders/pipeline. L='calculate' uses avg~1.67 of 12 observed LTs (stable 1-3, recent incl LT=3); mu_hat='recent_N' N=5 (chimepoint P37 regime length=5, mean38.2*(1+L)~102 low to match winter taper); sigma_hat='recent_N' N=5 (std~25*sqrt(1+L)~32 low var). Low base_stock~mu_hat (z~0 at q=0.5) <<2239 pipeline ensures order=0, minimizes holding on excess OH amid ghosts blocking future orders; fine for low demand now, prep to inflate explicit later for seasonal recovery.

Carry-over insight: Demand deep winter taper extended P37-41 avg38.2 (std~25, -25% vs P34-36 avg90), sustained 5 periods late fall/early winter (2019-10/21-11/18) for short-sleeve knitwear.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02, Cyber Monday): short-sleeve knitwear top in early winter/holiday season expects low demand continuation (deep winter taper regime P37-42 demands 79/41/33/17/21/68 avg 43 std~24, sustained 6 periods) but potential holiday spike (P42=68 uptick, Black Friday Nov29 passed, Cyber Monday today may boost apparel sales). On-hand 175 (draining ~4wks at 43/wk), in-transit 1996=confirmed ghosts from 7 lost shipments (P1:203, P3:271, P4:313, P17:450, P29:222, P34:537; total matches, no arrivals expected). Effective position=175 only. Backend subtracts full bloated pipeline=2171, forces order=0 unless inflate base_stock. Set explicit mu_hat=2571 to target order~400 (base_stock=2171+400; covers ~2.7*100/wk holiday buffer x L~1.7 despite losses; implied weekly mean~950 aligns hist peaks). L=calculate (confirmed stable avg~1.69 over 13 obs incl recent LT=3). sigma_hat=default (hist std~72 inflates cap~1074>400 for safety). Balances service (rebuilds buffer proactively for Dec holidays) vs holding (large orders risk loss per sustained pattern, minimizing actual inv buildup).

Reconciled pipeline: ghosts inflate in-transit, no new arrivals expected soon. L=calculate (historical 13 obs avg1.69 stable mix LT1-3). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=8 (changepoint P37 low regime length=8>3 sustained, P37-44 demands avg36.75 std~24 low var); scales to low (1+L)~2.7*37~100 base demand, low sigma minimizes z*sigma buffer, low base_stock vs ghosts/on-hand avoids excess holding (q=0.5 balanced), caps new order near 0.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 decision (2019-12-23, Christmas week). Short-sleeve knitwear top in deep winter taper regime sustained from P37 changepoint (avg decline to ~35 P37-45: 79/41/33/17/21/68/20/15/20, avg 34.9, std~22; regime length 9 periods, matches late fall/early-mid winter calendar 10/21-12/16, low suitability for short-sleeve). Recent P43-45: 20/15/20 avg 18 stable low, no holiday spike evidence yet despite Christmas proximity (cf. P42 Thanksgiving-week 68 modest). On-hand 520 covers >25 periods at ~20 demand; in-transit 1996 mostly ghosts (prior pattern ~2500, sustained but no new losses confirmed; P43 400 arrived P45 LT=2 on schedule). LT stable avg 1.71 (14 observed: 5x1, 8x2, 1x3). Set L 'calculate' for avg observed LT~1.71 < promised 2. Demand params 'recent_N' N=9 (regime length post-P37 shift, evidence: sustained avg 35 << prior P27-33 187, -81%; validated by calendar/product). mu_hat~(1+1.71)*34.9~124, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.71)*22~36, base_stock~124 (z=0), <<2516 position ensures order=0 optimal (avoids adding to holdings amid low demand; ample buffer for potential modest holiday uptick). Bridges ghosts by low base_stock accepting no-order until natural depletion, preferable to overordering (infinite holding losses > finite low-demand lost sales post-depletion).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30, post-Christmas/New Year's Eve): deep winter holiday low demand regime for short-sleeve knitwear top sustained P37-46 (10 periods: demands 79,41,33,17,21,68,20,15,20,29; avg 34.3, std~22.3, -60% vs prior P14-33 summer/taper avg~160); recent P43-46 avg~21 confirms holiday taper. On-hand 491 covers 15+ periods at ~30/demand; in-transit 1996 all old ghosts (no recent pending orders, last P43 arrived P45 LT=2). LT stable: 14 observed avg~1.71 (recent 10: avg 1.7). No new lost shipments. Use recent_N N=10 for L (avg LT 1.7), mu_hat ((1+1.7)*34.3~93), sigma_hat (sqrt(2.7)*22.3~37); low base_stock ~93 (z=0 at q=0.5) << pipe~2487 ensures order~0, minimizes holding on excess stock vs low demand, bridges ghost-inflated pipe by low params matching actual low need.

Carry-over insight: Demand deep winter holiday low regime extended P37-46 avg34.3 (std~22, -45% vs P27-36 avg~140), sustained 10 periods through Christmas (2019-10/21-12/23) for short-sleeve knitwear.
