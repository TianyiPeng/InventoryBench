No major holidays (next Halloween/Oct, but minor for apparel). Matches historical Jan-Feb decline (346\u2192172) and carry-over post-summer fall regime.

Historical losses persistent (accum ~1700u+ stuck in-transit); P32 in-transit=2590 likely includes overdue/lost (e.g. P29 order180 absent >3p past LT2/3).

Net position strong short-term if partial pipeline delivers, but stockout risk on spikes given volatility/losses. (e) Final order logic: Forecast 3p horizon (LT2+1) demand ~450 (150avg); OH183 covers P33+P34 partial; unreliable pipeline adds safety need but excess risks holding cost (=profit). Order modest 150 to replenish conservatively for volatile fall taper, matching recent orders (P32=160/P31=150) and avg demand, minimizing overstock as winter decline looms.",

(d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=182 covers 4-9 periods low demand; in-transit=2590 (high holding risk, likely mostly lost per history/pattern); no expected near arrivals (recent orders=0 since P37). (e) Order logic: Order 0 to minimize holding costs (=profit$1); ample buffer vs low forecast; avoid inflating doomed pipeline; monitor for spring rebound (post-P47 unlikely).",

Historical Jan data (346\u2192172) aligns with winter decline; game confirms summer high (P14-16 avg210) to winter low (P37+). (b) Demand regime: Deep winter low sustained P39-P43: 33/17/21/68/20 (avg32 std23, volatile minor spike P42=68 but recent P41-P43 avg36 confirms stable near-zero; -15% vs prior lows, no regime shift). Forecast P44+: 20-30/period. (c) Lead time: Recent LT3 (P36\u2192P39), prior 1-3 variable; no new arrivals P40-P43 (no recent orders post-P36 to test, but pattern of losses/delays persists). Prolonged in-transit (2590u) signals sustained losses (no arrivals despite history). (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=162 (covers 5-8 periods at 20-30 demand, post-P43 ending). In-transit=2590u (accum lost/delayed per carry-over ~2590 sustained high; if arrive, massive holding cost). No expected near-term arrivals (recent LT3 would be from P41 order=none). (e) Order logic: Zero order - ample on-hand for low demand, avoid adding to ballooned in-transit/loss risk; prioritize minimizing holding cost (P=H=1) on existing stock until spring uptick; service level secure.",
