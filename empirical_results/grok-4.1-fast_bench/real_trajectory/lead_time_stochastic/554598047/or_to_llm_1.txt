Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (stockouts in recent low-demand periods P38-P46 with sales=0 most periods); in-transit=972u unreliable due to persistent losses, but even if some arrive, holding cost=$1=profit means excess risks negative reward. Demand analysis: Sustained ultra-low regime confirmed (P38-46 avg~14, 9 periods <25; P46=15 continues no Christmas rebound for basic women's t-shirts); date 2019/12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's Eve unlikely to spike t-shirt demand (everyday basics, not partywear). OR recommendation=0 aligns with low empirical mean \u03bc\u0304 (recent-heavy would be ~15) and base-stock needing no order given pipeline illusion. Strategy: Follow OR at 0 to avoid adding to unreliable pipeline/excess holding risk; cover expected ~15 demand via any surviving in-transit, prioritize avoiding overstock in low-demand winter.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - sustained ultra-low demand (P38-46 avg ~14, no Christmas rebound) confirmed over 9+ periods; unreliable pipeline (972u in-transit but history of massive losses) makes ordering risky with holding=profit.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand low extended into late December post-Christmas: P38-46 avg 14 (-86% vs summer ~100); 9 consistent periods <25 confirms sustained shift with no holiday rebound for t-shirts.",
