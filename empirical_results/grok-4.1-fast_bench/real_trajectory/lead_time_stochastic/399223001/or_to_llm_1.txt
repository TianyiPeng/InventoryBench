Promised LT=2 holds for recent deliveries, but lost shipments pattern (P1,P3,P10,P13,P14,P17,P23,P24,P29) means effective pipeline is lower than reported 2537 units; likely only P32 (300 units, expected P34) and P33 (400 units, expected P35) viable near-term, totaling ~700 effective vs. total in-transit.

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent concludes confirm LT variability (LT=2 for P43->P45, LT=3 for P42->P45; prior LT=1-3 mixed, some losses like P34/P38). Promised LT=2 still relevant baseline, but expect arrivals in P46-P49 from recent P44-P45 orders (400 each). No new overdue beyond patterns.

Covers 10+ periods at 300 demand. Demand analysis: Date=2019/12/23 (Christmas week), jeggings (fall/winter ladies denim) expect spike (prior P42=447 Thanksgiving; P43-45 post-dip avg209 up to 258 signaling ramp). Historical high regime P30+ avg~315, holiday confirmed. OR=0 uses promised LT=2/historical demand, sees high pipeline/on-hand so base-stock covered.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT=2-3 reliable (e.g., P42 LT=3 arrived P45, P43 LT=2 arrived P45 per carry-over P46). P46 conclude arrived=0, as expected (no orders from P44 LT=3/P45 LT=2/P46 LT=1 due in P46; P44/P45 pending for P47/P48). Lost shipments pattern persists historically, but recent reliable; in-transit 3437 likely includes old lost + recent pending (e.g., P44=400, P45=400 outstanding). Inventory analysis: On-hand 781 sufficient for 3-4 periods at recent ~200 demand (P43-46 avg 205). Pipeline adds coverage if/when arrives, but even without, high buffer vs holding cost. Demand analysis: Post-Christmas (2019/12/30), after holiday spike (P42=447) and ramp (P43-46: 154,214,258,193 avg 205), expect dip or stable low ~150-200 for jeggings end-of-year (winter sales cooling post-holidays). Summer low regime (avg102) recovered to fall high (300+) and holiday peak, now post-peak normalization. Historical early-year Feb avg ~260, but too far. OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2 and all-history demand (ignores regime shifts/losses), aligns with high inventory position (base_stock exceeded by on-hand + pipeline). Strategy: Follow OR 0; no need to order with 781 on-hand covering (L+1)=3-4 periods demand outlook ~200 x 4=800; avoid adding to potential lost pipeline/holding costs.
