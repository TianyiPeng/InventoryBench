Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11), early February, no major holidays imminent for women's basic T-shirt (everyday jersey). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand: [0,0,11,17,38], showing regime shift after first two zeros\u2014increasing mean from ~0 to recent avg 22 (last 3 periods: 11,17,38). No lead-time observations yet. Use recent_3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize recent higher demand regime (changeloint ~2019-01-21, regime length=3, N=3). L default (promised=2). This boosts base_stock to cover rising demand over L+1=3 periods, balancing service vs holding (q=0.5).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18, Presidents' Day). Basic women's T-shirt. Demand ramping up: historical 0(1/7),0(1/14),11(1/21),17(1/28),38(2/4),54(p1 2/11). Changepoint after initial lows; recent regime 2019-01-21 to 2/11 (4 periods): mean 30, increasing trend possibly tied to late winter/Presidents' Day sales. On-hand=0, in-transit=46 (p1 order, expected arrive p3 if L=2), p1 demand=54 fully lost. No concluded arrivals, so L={"method":"default"} (promised 2). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=4 to target higher recent mean/variance: backend computes (1+2)*30=90 mu, sqrt(3)*std_recent~ higher sigma for elevated base stock. With q=0.5 (z=0), emphasizes mean coverage over 3 periods to reduce lost sales vs holding; pipeline covers near-term.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: mean ~30 (11,17,38,54), up from prior 0; sustained increasing over 4 periods

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), end-Feb, women's basic T-shirt. Demand ramping up in winter/early spring transition: recent demands 11(1/21),17(1/28),38(2/4),54(P1 2/11),100(P2 2/18)\u2014regime shift sustained over 5 periods, mean ~44, increasing trend post-Jan lows (possibly seasonal wardrobe shift). On-hand=0, in-transit=90 (P1:46 + P2:44, no arrivals/concludes yet\u2014expected P1 during P3 per L=2). No observed lead times, no overdues. Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture rising mean/volatility in current regime (N=5=max(min(5,20),3)); default L assumes promised=2. Parameters boost base stock ~3x prior low-demand levels (mu~44*3=132), balancing q=0.5 service vs holding; covers rising demand over L+1=3 periods despite pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4): Early March, women's basic T-shirt; demand surging seasonally into spring (historical: 0,0,11,17,38 then game:54,100,113), recent avg 89/period with upward trend (changelpoint post-2019-02-04 evidenced by 54\u2192100\u2192113, regime_length=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=132 (P1:46+P2:44+P3:42, sum matches); P1 order overdue (expected arrive P3 if L=2, but P3 conclude arrived=0, no LT confirmed); flag potential LT>2 or loss but no sustained evidence yet (only 1 overdue). Use default L=2 (no observed LTs for calculate/recent_N). mu_hat recent_N=3: (1+2)*89=267 to cover rising demand over 3 periods (pipeline=132 insufficient). sigma_hat recent_N=3: captures recent vol ~31/period, scaled sqrt(3)~54 for cap. Balances service (high mu to avoid stockouts, q=0.5 implies base_stock=mu_hat) vs holding (recent focus tempers overstock).

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration shift confirmed at Period 1 (2019-02-11): last 3 periods (54,100,113) avg 89 (+160% vs prior regime ~30), sustained over 3 periods with consistent increase

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), early spring; women's basic jersey t-shirt (everyday wear, no major holidays imminent like St. Patrick's Day). Demand regime high and sustained: P1-P4 demands 54,100,113,88 (mean 88.75, std 25.3), confirming acceleration shift noted in carry-over (no new changepoint; P4=88 fits avg~89). Lead time: 1 observation (P2 order arrived P4, LT=2); P1 order (46) overdue (expected P3 arrival if LT=2, absent in P3/P4 concludes), possible isolated loss but not sustained pattern. Pipeline 223 covers ~2.5 periods demand at recent mean; expect P3(42) arrival during P5 (post-decision). On-hand=0 risks P5 stockout. Use default L=2 (matches observed). mu_hat recent_4 (regime length=4, N=4) scales to ~266 for 3 periods. sigma_hat recent_4 captures volatility ~44 scaled. Balances service (q=0.5) vs holding by basing on recent high-demand regime, bridging potential P1 loss via higher base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (46 units) missing 2 periods past expected arrival (P3 for LT=2), signals possible lost shipment

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Early spring; Nora T-shirt (women's everyday basic) demand likely steady but recent high regime (P1-P5: 54,100,113,88,56; avg 82.2) sustained from changepoint at P1 (+160% vs pre-P1 ~30), despite P5 dip to 56. On-hand=0, in-transit=267 (includes P1:46 likely lost, P3:42 overdue/missing as P5 conclude arrived=0 expected there for LT=2, P4:135 exp P6, P5:44 exp P7; effective pipeline ~179). Covers ~2 periods recent demand (82*3=246 needed). Only 1 confirmed LT=2 (P2 order arrived P4). Use default L (promised=2, matches observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 (regime length=5 since P1 changepoint, N=max(min(5,20),3)=5) to capture high mean/volatility (~82, std~24), yielding mu~246, sigma~41; boosts base_stock to cover (1+2) high-demand periods + uncertainty, offsetting lost shipments via higher orders while q=0.5 balances profit/holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern: P1(46 units) and P3(42 units) confirmed missing (expected arrivals P3/P5, but P3/P5 concludes arrived=0; now >2 periods overdue)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Late March, spring season for women's T-shirt (everyday basics); demand sustained high post-winter shift (avg ~80 over P1-P6: 54,100,113,88,56,71), likely seasonal increase continuing, no major holidays imminent. On-hand=0, in-transit=223 (P1:46 overdue/lost, P3:42 overdue/lost, P4:135 overdue past expected P6 arrival LT=2 as P6 conclude showed only P5's 44 LT=1). Lost/delay pattern persists (P1,P3,P4), so parameters boost coverage. Observed LTs: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6). Use L default=2 (promised, conservative). mu_hat recent_6 (regime since P1 changepoint, N=6=max(min(6,20),3), mean~80 x3=240 to match pipeline scale despite losses). sigma_hat recent_6 (high vol~24 x sqrt3~41). Ensures base_stock ~240 (q=0.5 median conservative), orders to cover 3 periods high demand minus unreliable pipeline, balancing stockouts vs holding.

Carry-over insight: P4 order (135 units) overdue 1+ period past expected LT=2 arrival (P6 conclude arrived only from P5 LT=1); lost shipment pattern now includes P1(46),P3(42),P4(135), sustained over multiple periods

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1, early spring): Nora T-shirt (women's everyday basics) demand likely steady-increasing with seasonal warming; Easter (4/21) 3 weeks away may boost apparel. On-hand=0, in-transit=241 inflated by sustained lost shipments P1(46), P3(42), P4(135) total ~223 (confirmed no arrivals past expected LT=2: P3/P5/P6/P7 concludes show 0 from them); effective pipeline ~P7(18). Recent demand P4-P7: 88,56,71,114 avg=82.25 (sustained high regime per carry-over ~89, length>7 periods, no new changepoint); std~25. P7 conclude arrived=0 confirms no new arrivals. z=0 (q=0.5), base_stock=mu_hat; inflated IP suppresses orders, so explicit L=3 targets coverage of 4 periods (~328) to force order ~87 (min(328-241, cap~102)); mu_hat recent_4 captures current volatile regime (N=4=min(regime>7,20)); sigma_hat recent_4 ensures realistic cap amid volatility. Balances stockouts vs. holding by overriding ghosts for proactive ordering.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring pre-Easter (4/21); Nora women's jersey T-shirt (everyday basics) shows sustained high demand regime ~90-110/period (recent P6-P8:71/114/107 avg97; P7-P8:110 avg; no seasonal drop evident). On-hand=0, in-transit=311 = lost P1(46)+P3(42)+P4(135 overdue >3pd post-P6 expected)+P8(88 pending), effective reliable pipeline ~88. Recent LT observations (3): P2->P4=2, P5->P6=1, P7->P8=1 (avg~1.33, recent shift to 1 sustained 2pd). Default params yield mu_hat~(1+2)*88=264 <311 pipeline -> order=0; to bridge lost phantom inventory gap, set L recent_3 (infer actual~1.33), mu_hat explicit=420 [equiv ~140-180/period equiv over 1+L~2.33-3, buffers losses + recent high demand forecast 110/period *3+pad], sigma default (vol~27 stable).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15): Mid-spring, t-shirt demand strong and sustained high (~100+/period) as weather warms; recent P6-P9 demands (71,114,107,122) avg 103.5 confirm ongoing acceleration regime from P1 (no reversal post-P5 dip). On-hand=0, in-transit=420 likely inflated by lost/delayed (P1=46 >8pd overdue, P3=42 >5pd, P4=135 >4pd overdue; P8=88/P9=109 pending LT=2). Observed LTs only from arrivals: P4(LT=2 from P2), P6(LT=1 P5), P8(LT=1 P7); recent_3 avg~1.33 reflects faster recent deliveries amid losses. L=recent_N N=3 uses recent LT evidence. mu_hat=recent_N N=4 weights sustained high-demand regime (chgpnt post-P5 dip, regime len=4>3; avg103.5*(1+1.33)~241 covers ~2.3pd). sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 captures recent vol~22 (elevates safety stock vs default). Params boost pipeline to offset losses (OR ignores lost, so higher mu/sigma forces more orders), targeting ~2-3pd coverage vs ~100pd demand while q=0.5 balances profit/holding.

Carry-over insight: Recent LT stabilized at 1pd for last 2 arrivals (P5->P6, P7->P8); lost pattern persists with P4(135) 4+pd overdue (exp P6) adding to P1(46)/P3(42)

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter (April 21, 2019); Nora T-shirt (women's everyday jersey basic) sees sustained high spring demand. Recent demands P7-P10: 114,107,122,133 (avg 119, up ~33% from prior ~89 regime P1-P3). On-hand 64 (real); in-transit 223 exactly = confirmed lost shipments P1(46 overdue since P3), P3(42 since P5), P4(135 since P6) per history (no arrivals in expected + subsequent concludes). No real pipeline beyond on-hand. Compensate ghost 223 by inflating mu_hat: forecast mu_pd=120 (recent_4 avg), L=default=2 (recent successful LTs avg~1.4 mixed 1-2, conservative promised), 1+L=3 periods coverage=360 desired_real_base; mu_hat=360+223=583 explicit. Sigma explicit 120 to ensure cap >= needed order (sigma_pd~69, cap~194 mu_pd +1.645*69~308 >296 order=583-287). Ensures backend orders ~296 (effective real base=64+296=360 covering 3pd@120), balancing stockouts vs holding given profit=holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Ghost in-transit confirmed: 223 units total lost shipments (P1=46, P3=42, P4=135; matches current in-transit, overdue 8+/5+/5+ periods); Demand regime shift P7+: avg 119 (114,107,122,133 over 4pd, +33% vs prior 89 avg)

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29, late April spring into summer; T-shirt seasonal ramp-up expected). Demands: recent P9-P11 avg 140 (122,133,164; +26% vs P7-P8 avg 111), P11 stockout (demand 164, sold 64). On-hand 0, nominal pipeline 519 but 223 ghosts (P1=46/P3=42/P4=135 overdue 10+/8+/7+ pd), real pipeline ~296 (P11:296). Backend subtracts full 519 (overstates by 223), so inflate mu_hat by 223 for correct targeting. Forecast: 140/period recent regime, L=2 conservative (promised; recent LTs 1-2 avg1.4 but losses add unreliability), (1+2)*140=420 +223 ghosts=643 explicit mu_hat targets real IP ~450 post-order (~124 qty). Sigma recent_5 captures volatility ~22/period scaled to ~38. Ensures backend orders to cover 3pd demand despite ghosts, balancing stockout vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: avg 140 (P9-P11:122,133,164; +26% vs P7-P8 avg 111), sustained 3+ periods with spring T-shirt ramp-up trend

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6): Early May spring, T-shirt demand in sustained high regime ~142 avg (P9-12:122,133,164,150), continuing ramp-up trend (+26% vs prior). On-hand=0, in-transit=643 (223 ghost lost from P1/3/4 +420 recent P11=296/P12=124). LT observed: 5 arrivals avg1.4 (2,1,1,2,1); recent3 avg1.33. No new arrivals in P12 conclude (expected none overdue). Set L recent_N=5 to use actual avg~1.4 < promised2, avoiding overstock. mu_hat recent_N=4 for current regime mean~142*(1+L). sigma_hat recent_N=4 for recent vol~20 (stable high demand). This boosts base_stock for service amid ghosts/delays while shorter L reduces holding via backend cap/policy; recent params capture spring shift, balancing R_t.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demands P9-P13: 122,133,164,150,118 (avg 137, std~19); regime shift from P9 confirmed in carry-over, length=5 periods. On-hand 178 covers ~1-2 periods demand; in-transit 347 = 223 ghosts (P1:46,P3:42,P4:135 overdue 12+/10+/9+ pd) + P12:124 (exp arrive P14 LT=2). Recent LTs (last 5 observed: P11 LT2, P9 LT1, P8 LT2, P7 LT1, P5 LT1; avg 1.4); mixed 1-2, no new stabilization. Use recent_N N=5 for all params to capture recent demand regime/volatility and LT avg, adjusting OR base-stock for (1+~1.4)~2.4pd coverage (~330 mu_hat) balancing stockouts vs holding amid ghosts.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20): Late spring, womens basic t-shirt; seasonal demand sustained high ~135 avg (P9-P14 demands:122,133,164,150,118,122; regime from P9 shift confirmed prior, no new changepoint). On-hand 180 covers ~1.3pd; in-transit 223=confirmed ghosts (P1:46,P3:42,P4:135 overdue 12+/10+/9+pd, no arrivals ever). No real pipeline arrivals expected P15 (P13/P14 orders=0). Recent LT all 2 (last 3 arrivals). L default=promised 2 (1+L=3pd cover). mu_hat explicit=3*134.8 +223 ghosts=627 (compensates ghost pipeline overstatement, targets true base~405 despite OR seeing pipeline=403; since z=0, base=mu_hat, orders ~627-403=224 to cover gaps). sigma_hat recent_N=6 matches current low volatility std~18pd (boosts cap to ~210+30=240 allowing needed order). Balances high service (avoid stockouts) vs holding (q=0.5 minimal safety).

Carry-over insight: Lead time stabilized at 2 periods (last 3 arrivals: P8->P10 LT=2, P11->P13 LT=2, P12->P14 LT=2; avg prior mixed but recent consistent); Ghost shipments fixed at 223 units (P1=46, P3=42, P4=135)

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27, Memorial Day holiday - potential T-shirt demand spike due to summer start/BBQs/outdoor activities). Recent demand regime stable high ~141 avg last 5 periods (P11-15:164,150,118,122,153), forecast ~145/pd amid spring/summer ramp-up. On-hand 27 low; in-transit 447 = 223 ghosts (P1=46,P3=42,P4=135, confirmed overdue >5pd) + 224 real (P15 order, LT=2 arrives P17). Real position ~251; desired base_stock ~3*145=435 (L=2); desired order ~184. OR sees position 474 (incl ghosts), z=0 so base=mu_hat; set explicit mu_hat=474+184=658 (~650 rounded conservatively) to induce correct order-up-to despite ghosts. LT stable 2 (promised/recent); sigma recent for cap allowance.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03), early summer for women's T-shirt (everyday basics, strong seasonal demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=623 (incl. confirmed 223 ghost units from P1=46/P3=42/P4=135; effective pipeline ~400 from P15=224 exp. arrive during P17 LT=2, P16=176 exp. P18). Recent demand stable high regime since P9 (spring ramp-up): P9-P16 demands (122,133,164,150,118,122,153,147) avg~135, std~15.8; sustained 8+ periods, no new shift vs. prior carry-over. LT stabilized at 2 (last 3 observed: P12->P14=2, P11->P13=2, P8->P10=2). No new arrivals in P16 conclude (expected none). Set L recent_3 (avg=2) for accurate backend LT; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_8 to capture elevated mean/vol in (1+2)=3pd window (~405 mean demand, ~27 std), yielding base_stock~405 (z*=0 at q=0.5); high pipeline (623)>base_stock so minimal order, balances holding vs. stockout risk while ghosts inflate pipeline (backend unaware, params ensure conservatism).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand P9-P17 (9pd): 122,133,164,150,118,122,153,147,123; avg=137, std\u224817 (no new changepoint, fluctuation within regime). On-hand=277 covers 2pd demand; IP=500 inflated by 223 confirmed ghost shipments (P1=46,P3=42,P4=135, overdue 15+/13+/14+ pd, no arrivals). Recent LTs (9 obs): avg=1.56 (mixed 1-2pd, last 4:1.75); close to promised 2. Normal mu=(1+2)*137=411; to offset ghosts for target base_stock\u2248411+223=634 despite phantom pipeline, explicit mu_hat=650 (+buffer). L=default (promised 2 conservative for coverage).

Period 19 (2019-06-17): early summer for women's T-shirt; expect sustained high demand ~130/period (summer peak season) despite P18 dip to 82 (single-period anomaly, not sustained). On-hand 195 covers ~1.5pd; in-transit 373 = 223 ghost (P1=46,P3=42,P4=135, overdue 15+pd confirmed) + 150 real (P18 order, exp P20 LT=2). Backend pipeline=568 overstates real net 345 by 223. Recent LT mix but stable avg~1.8 (last 5:1,2,2,2,2); default L=2 conservative for coverage. Demand regime P9-P18 (10pd sustained per carryover): mean 131.4/period, real base_stock=3*131.4=394. Compensate ghosts by explicit mu_hat=394+223=617 (z=0 so sigma irrelevant, orders ~617-568=49 to effective real base 394).

Ghosts 223 (P1=46,P3=42,P4=135) inflate in-transit 272 (real pipeline only P19=49); total pipeline 218 OH + 272 IT =490, effective position 218+49=267. Forecast period demand 132, L=2, true mu_hat=396; desired base stock 396, order qty ~129 to cover. Backend z=0 (q=0.5), base=mu_hat, so explicit mu_hat=396+223 ghosts=619 ensures order=619-490=129. L explicit=2 (conservative, recent LT avg 1.5 over 10 obs but max=2 observed, covers delays). Sigma recent_10 N=10 yields ~sqrt(3)*23.4=40.6, boosts cap~204+43=247>129, balances service (high recent demand) vs holding (elevated OH). No stockouts recently due to arrivals.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01): Early summer peak season for women's basic T-shirts; expect sustained demand ~133/wk (last 10 periods P11-P20: 164,150,118,122,153,147,123,82,127,144 avg exactly 133; P18=82 dip not sustained as P19-P20 rebound to 127/144). On-hand=74 low; in-transit=401 inflated by fixed 223 ghost units (P1=46,P3=42,P4=135 overdue indefinitely); effective reliable pipeline=74+(401-223)=252 (~2 periods demand). Recent LT observations (10 arrivals): avg 1.5 (2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,1); close to promised 2. Target base stock=(1+2)*133=399; to bridge ghost gap, inflate mu_hat=399+223=622 (backend sees pipeline=475, orders 622-475=147 to reach effective 399-252=147). L=default (promised 2 conservative vs recent 1.5). Sigma recent_10 matches demand regime (shift ~P11, length=10).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08): Mid-summer, peak season for women's T-shirt (Nora jersey basic); demand regime stable high since changepoint P9 (2019-04-08), last 13 periods (P9-P21) avg 130.6 (+49% vs P1-P8 avg 87.9), sustained evidence with consistent 100-160 range (P18=82 single dip, rebounded). On-hand=0 risks stockout; in-transit=548 overstated by confirmed ghosts 223 (P1=46/P3=42/P4=135, per carry-over); real pipeline ~325 (P19=49 overdue 1pd LT=2 exp P21 no arr, P20=129 exp P22 LT=2, P21=147 exp P23). Recent LT observed: last 5 (P11/12/15 LT=2, P16/18 LT=1) avg 1.6 but use default L=2 (promised, aligns carry-over stabilization). mu_hat explicit=615=(1+2)*130.6 +223 ghosts compensates inflated pipeline for unbiased base-stock (backend orders real_demand_(1+L) - real_pipe); sigma_hat recent_N=13 captures regime volatility (std~28 pd, scaled sqrt(3)~49). Ensures OR orders ~67 now (615-548), covers ~0.5pd demand buffer vs holding cost, maximizes R_t amid losses.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15): Mid-summer peak for women's jersey T-shirt; demand seasonal high but fluctuating recently (P18-P22: 82,127,144,113,84; no sustained drop, within prior volatility). Confirmed P19 order (49 units) lost (expected LT=2 arrival P21, absent from P22 conclude; now 4 periods past decision). Total ghosts=272 (P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49), inflating in-transit 486 (real pipeline: P21=147 due P23 LT=2, P22=67 due P24; 214 total). Recent LTs (last 6 obs: P13 LT2,P14 LT2,P17 LT2/P16 LT1,P19 LT1,P22 LT2) avg~1.67, close to promised 2. On-hand=45 low vs expected demand ~110-120. Use L default (promised 2). mu_hat explicit=636 = 3*121.3 (last 10 dem mean P13-P22) +272 ghosts, inflating base_stock to offset ghost pipeline bias (z~0 so base\u2248mu_hat; backend orders ~636 - (45+486) but effective ~636-(45+214) after ghost adjust). sigma_hat recent_10 captures vol~24 (helps cap). Balances high service vs holding by compensating invisibles, covering ~3pd demand + ghosts.

Carry-over insight: Ghost in-transit updated to 272 units (added P19=49 overdue 4+ periods; total P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49; matches 486-214 real pipeline)

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22, mid-summer peak for women's basic t-shirts; expect sustained demand ~120/period amid fluctuations). Recent demand last 10 periods (P14-P23): mean 121.2, std 24.1. Position: on-hand 142 + in-transit 377 (but 272 ghosts P1=46/P3=42/P4=135/P19=49 overdue 8+/6+/5+/5+ pd, confirmed no arrivals; real pipeline ~105, real position ~247). Needed real base ~ (1+1.6)*121 + 1.64*sqrt(2.6)*24 ~314+63=377; target order ~130 to reach ~377. Backend sees inflated position 519, so explicit mu_hat=680 yields base_stock=680 (z=0), order~161 (capped if needed but cap sufficient), compensating ghosts by inflating target 680-519=161. L recent_10 (~1.6 avg last 10 LTs:2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1) reflects mixed recent LTs. Sigma recent_10 provides realistic volatility for cap ~ mean_pd 680/2.6~262 +1.64*24/1.61~262+25=287 (allows order). No overdue changes; ghosts sustained but no new losses evident.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29), late summer; Nora women's t-shirt demand stable/fluctuating ~110/period (last 8 demands P17-P24: 123,82,127,144,113,84,117,106 avg=112, std~21; scattered lows at P18/P22 but not sustained regime shift down vs prior ~120 avg). OH=36 low vs ~110 demand (likely stockout post-decision). Intransit=538 includes fixed 272 ghosts (P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49; overdue 6+pd), real pipeline~266. Recent LTs mixed (last 6 observed: P15 LT2,P16 LT1,P18 LT1,P20 LT2,P21 LT2,P22 LT1; avg=1.5, no new stabilization). P24 arrived=0 (expected none overdue). Set L recent_6 to use actual shorter avg LT~1.5 (lowers (1+L)~2.5 vs promised 3, reduces overstock risk). mu_hat recent_8 adapts to current lower regime (base_stock~(2.5)*112=280, z=0 so mu-driven). sigma_hat recent_8 for realistic volatility/cap~ mu/(1+L) +1.645*21/sqrt(2.5)~112+22=134/period. Compensates ghosts/shorter LT by basing on recent demand/LT, ensuring coverage for ~2.5pd demand despite unreliable pipeline.

LT mixed sustained (last 10 obs avg~1.6: 6x LT2, 4x LT1). L recent_10 uses recent avg LT; sigma_hat recent_8 captures new regime vol; mu_hat explicit 900 \u2248 ghosts 538 + true need 110*(1+1.6\u22482.6)=286 inflated +safety to ~362 order (3+pd coverage).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26): Late summer for women's basic t-shirt; demand decline sustained into fall transition, recent P25-28:104,83,69,75 (avg 82.75, std~17.3), regime shift at P25 (length=4 periods confirmed by carry-over). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=836=768 ghosts (prior 433 + P26=335 lost, as P28 conclude arrived=0 but expected LT=2 arrival) +68 real pipeline (P27 order, expected P29). High ghosts inflate pipeline, causing OR backend to underorder; compensate with recent low-demand stats for balanced base_stock targeting ~83*(1+L) to cover ~3 periods post-decline while high pipeline subtracts. LT recent mixed (avg~1.7 last 10 observed arrivals, e.g., LT3 P23->P26, LT2/1 prior). Use recent_N N=4 for mu/sigma (regime_length=4, min(4,20)=4>3); recent_10 for L to reflect recent avg vs promised 2/outdated 2-stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Ghost in-transit updated to 768 units (added P26=335 confirmed lost: ordered P26 expected P28 LT=2, but P28 conclude arrived=0; total P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49,P24=161,P26=335); real pipeline=68 (P27); lost shipment pattern sustained over multiple periods with evidence.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2, Labor Day Monday - potential end-of-summer sales but demand continues declining without spike: P27-P29 avg 69, P25-P29 avg 79). Ghosts now total 836 (all in-transit; confirmed P27=68 lost as P29 conclude arrived=0 expected LT=2; real pipeline=0, on-hand=0, stockouts P28-P29). Recent demand regime decline sustained 5pd (changepoint ~P25, N=5). Counter ghost pipeline by explicit mu_hat=836 ghosts + 237 (3pd x 79 recent mean) =1073; with L=default=2, base_stock=1073, expected order~237 (3pd cover) < cap. mu_hat bridges lost shipments for backend. sigma recent_5 captures low vol (std~16).

Carry-over insight: Ghost in-transit updated to 836 units (added P27=68 confirmed lost: ordered P27 expected P29 LT=2, P29 conclude arrived=0 overdue 1pd; total P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49,P24=161,P26=335,P27=68); Demand further decline confirmed at P27: avg 69 (P27-P29:69,75,64; -19% vs P25-P26 avg 93.5), sustained 3+ periods now 5pd total decline regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09): Late summer/early fall for women's jersey T-shirt; seasonal demand decline sustained (P27-P30: 69,75,64,53 avg=65, -38% vs all-time mean~105, continuing prior regimes). Low on-hand=15 after partial coverage in P30; in-transit=1005=768 ghosts (P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49,P24=161,P26=335) +237 real (P30 order). Recent LT=3 (P23->P26, P27->P30). Real position~252 \u2248 desired base=65*(1+3)=260 for recent mean_d & LT. Ghosts inflate visible position=1020, so explicit mu_hat=1028 (~ghosts + desired_real_base) triggers small order~8 to fine-tune/maintain effective real coverage, balancing stockouts (recent P28-P29) vs holding. L explicit=3 matches recent LT for cap computation. Sigma default (z=0 so irrelevant to base_stock; historical std ensures cap>order qty).

Carry-over insight: Ghost in-transit corrected to 768 units (P27=68 arrived P30 LT=3, excluded from prior 836; confirmed list P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49,P24=161,P26=335 overdue 5pd past exp P28 LT=2); Demand decline deepened P27-P30 avg65 (69,75,64,53; P30=53 -30% vs P27-P29 avg69), sustained 4pd with seasonal end-summer evidence; LT=3 sustained last 2 arrivals (P23->P26=3, P27->P30=3)

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16): Late summer/early fall, Nora women's T-shirt demand in sustained decline regime (carry-over P27+: avg~65, now P27-P31:69,75,64,53,37 avg 59.6 -further drop with P31=37 fitting seasonal end-of-summer T-shirt slowdown; no new changepoint as not yet 3+pd sustained beyond prior). Ghosts fixed at 768 (carry-over P31 list unchanged; P31 arrived=0 but no expected orders overdue newly confirmed). Total in-transit=1013 implies real pipeline=1013-768=245 \u2248(1+3)*59.6=238, well-covered for recent LT=3 sustained (last 2 arrivals P23->P26 LT3, P27->P30 LT3). On-hand=0. Set L=explicit 3 to reflect recent sustained LT. mu_hat=explicit 768(ghosts)+238=1006 to compensate permanent ghosts: backend base=1006 -1013=0 order now, but effective order= real_target(238) - real_pipeline(245)=0; future when real arrives, intransit drops but ghosts stay, enabling correct reordering on real pipeline. sigma_hat=recent_5 for low recent vol (std~15pd, sqrt(4)*15~30 total), affects cap only (z=0 so no safety stock). Balances low holding vs service amid ghosts/decline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23), late September fall transition; Nora women's basic t-shirt demand in sustained seasonal decline (summer peak over), recent P25-P32 avg 64 (104,83,69,75,64,53,37,29), trending down to P30-P32 avg 40 (-~50% vs P25-P29 avg 79), changepoint at P25 confirmed sustained 8+ periods with evidence of post-summer drop. On-hand 216 covers ~5-7 periods at 30-40 demand/period; ghost in-transit fixed at 768 (lost: P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49,P24=161,P26=335; real pipeline ~0, no expected arrivals soon). High total pipeline (216+768=984) ensures backend orders low/0 under base stock policy, optimal to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($1/unit) during low-demand fall (q=0.5 implies conservative service). Parameters: L recent_10 (last 10 LT obs avg ~1.9: recent 1,2,3,3,2,1,2,1,... varying 1-3); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_8 capture low regime mean~64/vol~24 (helps scale forecast to ~3pd coverage ~192 low demand, base ~192 <<984 pipeline \u2192 order~0 aligns w/ ample on-hand, avoids overstock).

Carry-over insight: Demand deepened decline at Period 30: avg 40 (P30-P32:53,37,29; -50% vs P25-P29 avg 79), sustained 3 periods extending total decline regime to 8pd with fall seasonal evidence for t-shirts; LT variable avg 1.9 over last 8 obs (1,2,3,3,2,1,2,1), no stabilization.

Ghosts fixed at 768 (P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49,P24=161,P26=335, no new lost). Real pipeline=0, on-hand=171 covers ~4 periods at 41 demand. LT recent observations (last 6: P30 LT2, P31 LT1, P27 LT3, P23 LT3, P21 LT2, P22 LT1) avg2.0. To bridge ghosts, set mu_hat explicit=768(ghosts) + (1+2)*41=768+123=891, so backend targets effective real base_stock=123 despite fake pipeline=939 (order=891-939<0\u21920 correct now).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07): Fall season (early October), women's t-shirt demand in deepened decline regime due to end-of-summer seasonality; recent P30-P34 demands (53,37,29,45,24) avg 37.6 (-50%+ vs prior regimes ~80-130), sustained 5pd with dropping trend (P34=24). On-hand=147 covers ~4pd demand at current rate; in-transit=768 all confirmed ghosts (P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49,P24=161,P26=335 overdue 9+/6+/5+/15+/9+/7pd past LT2 exp), real pipeline=0, no expected arrivals. LT variable but recent 8 obs avg~1.9 (LTs from P32/P30/P26/P23/P22/P19: 1,2,3,3,2,1,2,1). Reconcile: high ghost pipeline inflates backend view, suppressing orders. Parameters use recent_N=8 for L (~2) to match actual avg LT; recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect low mean/vol regime (mu~(1+2)*37.6~113, sigma~sqrt(3)*~11~19), yielding low base_stock~113 (z~0 at q=0.5); combined with ghost pipeline, ensures minimal ordering to avoid holding costs on excess inv amid decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline extended P30-P34: avg 37.6 (53,37,29,45,24; -46% vs P18-P29 avg~100), P34=24 confirms sharp fall drop-off, sustained 5pd with Oct seasonality for t-shirts; LT avg 1.9 over last 8 obs (1,2,3,3,2,1,2,1 from P19/P22/P23/P26/P30/P32 arrives), variable no new stabilization

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Mid-fall seasonality for women's basic t-shirt; demand sharply declining (P35=16, last 6pd P30-P35 avg34, last 3pd P33-P35 avg28.3, confirming Oct low-demand regime vs summer peaks). On-hand=131 sufficient for ~5-8pd at ~20pd demand, real pipeline=0 (in-transit=768 all confirmed ghosts: P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49,P24=161,P26=335; no new losses/overdues as recent orders arrived/zero). Total pipeline=899. To counter ghosts, set mu_hat explicit=843=768(ghosts)+75(3*25 demand forecast over 1+L~3pd, conservative avg recent declining regime). Backend z=0 so base_stock=843 targets real on-hand~75; current pipeline>843 so order=0 (deplete excess), later auto-orders ~demand drawdown to maintain target (e.g., post-depletion order=25 restores). L recent_8 (last LTs:2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1 avg1.875~2) for accurate cap scaling. Sigma recent_6 (P30-P35 std~14, low vol matches regime) ensures cap>needed replenishments (~25). Balances low service (q=0.5) vs holding by targeting minimal real base for low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline further deepened at P35: avg 28 (P33-P35:45,24,16; -30% vs P30-P32 avg40), extending sustained fall regime to 6pd (P30-P35 avg34) with Oct t-shirt seasonality evidence; Ghost in-transit stable at 768 units (no new confirmed losses)

On-hand=114 covers 3-5+ periods of low demand (~20-30), real pipeline=0 (in-transit 768=stable ghosts P1=46+P3=42+P4=135+P19=49+P24=161+P26=335, no arrivals P33-P36). LT variable avg~1.9 over last 8 obs (LTs:1,2,3,3,2,1,2,1), no new arrivals/stabilization. Changepoint evidence: deepened decline sustained 7pd from P30 (regime_length=7, N=7>3). Set L recent_8 for accurate avg LT~1.9; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 for low recent mean/vol (backend computes ~3*32=96 mu_hat, low std), ensuring conservative base-stock low orders given high OHIP/on-hand, balances low service risk (low demand) vs holding (114+), ignores historical high demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28), late October fall season for women's basic t-shirt; sustained demand decline regime P30-P37 avg 31 (53,37,29,45,24,16,17,27), deepened low volatility ~13 std, seasonal end-summer/fall drop-off confirmed with Oct dates (P35=16, P36=17 lows). Ghosts stable at 768 (P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49,P24=161,P26=335; no new losses, real pipeline=0, no arrivals P33-P37 despite prior orders). On-hand 87 covers ~3pd demand (93 target). LT variable recent 8 arrivals LTs (1,2,3,3,1,2,2,1) avg 1.875. No new changepoints. L: recent_N N=8 for avg LT~1.9. mu_hat: explicit 861 = 768 ghosts + 3*31 recent_8 mean_demand (approx 1+2pd coverage). sigma_hat: recent_N N=8 std~13 scaled. Bridges ghosts by inflating mu_hat=ghosts + desired_base; backend order = desired_base - real_onhand (z=0), forces replenishment of depletions ignoring fake pipeline, balances low service (q=0.5) vs holding while maintaining real base~93.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4): Deep winter low-demand season for women's t-shirt; recent demands P31-P38 avg 25.9 (37,29,45,24,16,17,27,12), P36-P38 avg19 confirming continued decline, volatile but low teens-20s. On-hand 75 + real in-transit ~6 (total 774 - 768 ghosts stable) = real net ~81 > desired ~78=(1+2)*26. Ghosts inflate pipeline/net, backend would under-order without adjustment. Explicit mu_hat=846=768 ghosts + 78 targets total_net=846 (real_net=78 equiv), triggers timely small orders (~demand/PD) upon real depletion to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding (z=0 exact mean target optimal for q=0.5). L recent_8 avg~1.9\u22482 for accurate cap scaling. Sigma recent_10 avg32.4 std~17 low vol reflects regime, limits cap conservatively (~846/3 + 0.95*17 \u2248298 ample for small orders). Bridges lost shipments by inflating target over ghosts.

Carry-over insight: Demand deepened decline at Period 36: avg 19 (P36-P38:17,27,12; -33% vs P33-P35 avg 28), sustained 3 periods extending total fall/winter t-shirt regime to 10+pd with Nov low-season evidence

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=63 covers ~4pd at recent ~17/d; in-transit=774 w/768 ghost lost (stable per prior: P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49,P24=161,P26=335), real pipeline~6 (likely P38=6). No new arrivals P39=0, no overdue updates. LT variable recent avg~1.8 (last10 obs:2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1,2,1); no stabilization or new losses confirmed. Chngpt evidence: deepened decline sustained 10+pd P30+, recent5pd N=5 for mu/sigma captures low mean/vol; L recent_N=10 for avg1.8<2 adjusts backend for observed shorter LT, low mu~3*17=51 base w/q=0.5 median-ish reduces overstock/holding vs default high historical mean, safety via sigma covers var while ghosts ignored by backend but real inv adequate.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18): Late fall/winter seasonality for women's t-shirt confirms deep demand decline regime (ongoing since P18, deepened multiple times P25/P27/P30/P33/P35/P36/P39); recent P36-P40 demands (17,27,12,12,8) avg 15.2, trending lower with P38-P40 avg 10.7 (-58% vs P33-P37 avg 25.8), low volatility. On-hand 55 covers 3-5 periods at ~15 dem; in-transit 774 dominated by stable 768 ghost units (P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49,P24=161,P26=335), real pipeline minimal (possibly P38=6 overdue 1pd past LT2 exp P40). No new arrivals in P36-P40. LT variable avg ~1.9 over last 10 obs (1,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1,2 from recent arrives); use recent_10 for L to capture avg<2. For mu_hat/sigma_hat, recent_N=5 captures latest deepened low-demand regime (length=5pd sustained evidence), informing backend low base_stock ~15*(1+1.9)~29 to minimize holding on excess OH while covering low dem, bridging ghost losses by conservative forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand further deepened to bottom at Period 38: avg 11 (P38-P40:12,12,8; -57% vs P33-P37 avg 26), sustained 3 periods extending deep winter t-shirt regime (>20pd total decline) with Nov evidence

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=22 covers 1-2pd, in-transit=860 mostly ghost~768 (stable prior: P1=46,P3=42,P4=135,P19=49,P24=161,P26=335) + recent P38=6 likely lost + P42=86 pending. LT variable avg1.8 over last10 obs (LTs:2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1,2,1 no new stabilization).

Real pipeline ~86-92, real IP~89-95 >> desired ~(1+1.9)*12~34 coverage ample for low demand. Parameters: L recent_10 (last 10 LT avg~1.8 variable no new stab); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 (regime len=7, P38+ low shift sustained).

Upcoming Jan low~10-15 but historical Feb ramp (P1 02-11 d=54, prior seeds Jan low->Feb38), LT~2 means orders now arrive mid-Jan for Feb coverage. Backend unaware of ghosts/overstates IP, orders 0 on default params (mean_d~70-80 all hist -> mu~210<839). Bridge via explicit mu_hat=1000 targets base=1000 (z=0), initial order~161 capped ok; sustains real IP buildup to ~226 (1000-774 ghosts) for ramp/seasonal buffer w/ low current holding risk. L=calculate uses avg observed LT~2 for consistent cap/scaling. Sigma=default leverages full hist high std~50+ for ample cap (420+>161). Balances low winter service vs future sales max R.
