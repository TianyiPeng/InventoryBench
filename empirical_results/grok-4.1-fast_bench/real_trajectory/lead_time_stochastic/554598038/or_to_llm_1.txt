Promised LT=2 still assumed by OR. Inventory analysis: On-hand=36 covers ~3 periods of recent low demand (~12/period); effective pipeline=0 due to losses, so inventory position=36. Demand analysis: Winter low regime sustained for women's basic T-shirts (P39-P45 avg ~11.8: 12,8,15,18,11,8,15), -22% vs prior winter avg, no Christmas spike expected 2019/12/23 for jersey basics (holiday demand favors gifts/apparel like sweaters, not T-shirts); full history shows seasonal drop confirmed. OR recommendation: 0 units, aligned with low empirical mean/variance and high position under promised LT=2.

Inventory position: On-hand=27 (from P46 end), covers 2-3 periods at winter low demand ~10/period; IT=969u not reliable due to permanent loss pattern (no arrivals P46-P32 spans 15 periods). Demand analysis: Winter low regime sustained into late Dec 2019 (P46=9, fits P39-P44 avg 11.7 and P35-P41 avg 15.3 downtrends); T-shirt sales floor confirmed for holidays (no surge expected end-Dec/New Year's for women's jersey basics in winter). Calendar: 2019/12/30 near year-end, post-Christmas slump reinforces low demand vs summer peaks. OR rec=0 aligns with low historical mean used (ignores recent regime but correctly signals no order need).
