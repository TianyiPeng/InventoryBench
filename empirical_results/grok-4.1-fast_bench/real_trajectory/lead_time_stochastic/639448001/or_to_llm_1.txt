{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, actual varies (1-3 observed historically, e.g., P39 order arrived P41 LT=2, P40 LT=3, P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2); many lost shipments confirmed (in-transit=1440 matches accumulated losses like P38:150 overdue since P42 conclude). No new arrivals in P46 conclude. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=689 (from P45 arrivals + low sales), covers 40+ periods at recent avg~15 demand; in-transit=1440 likely mostly lost (no arrivals despite 10+ periods overdue for oldest). Demand analysis: Post-Christmas (P47=2019/12/30, New Year's week) - handbags see sustained lows post-holiday surge (P42=221 Black Friday spike); recent P43-P46 (12/2-12/23): demands 18,14,24,5 avg 15, confirming carry-over pre-Christmas lull extension (-87% vs P40-P42 holiday avg119); no rebound signal (P46=5 ultra-low), world knowledge: post-Xmas returns/sales dip accessory demand. OR recommendation: 0 units (appropriate given high inventory, historical mean low, promised LT); no override needed as pipeline/on-hand buffers >> (L+1)=3 periods expected demand (~45). Strategy: Order 0 to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period on 689+), avoid adding to lost pipeline; monitor for post-NY demand shift.",

  "carry_over_insight": "Post-Christmas demand sustained low confirmed: P44-P46 (2019-12-09 to 12-23) avg 14 (14,24,5) vs P43=18 (-22%), 3 periods consistent extension of holiday lull into year-end.",
