  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variable 1-3 periods with some reliability (P42 LT3 arrived P45, P43 LT2 P45, P36 LT3 P39, P41 LT2 P43), but losses common (e.g., P38 lost past LT4); P44 order (400) overdue past LT=2 (no P46 arrival), possible LT=3 in P47 or lost; P45 order (400) expected LT=2 in P47.

Demand analysis: Post-Thanksgiving/Christmas dip sustained P43-46 avg 112 (-53% vs P39-42 peak avg240), 4 periods volatile but consistently lower entering late Dec/early Jan post-holiday (12/30); hoodie demand likely further decline post-Christmas gift returns/season end, no rebound signal; historical winter highs but current pattern post-peak. OR rec 0 aligns with high inventory/pipeline vs its historical demand estimate; no override needed as overstock risk high (holding $1/unit/period on 452+), stockouts unlikely short-term.
