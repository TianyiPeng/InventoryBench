  "rationale": "(a) RICHIE HOOD is a men's cotton-blend sweatshirt hoodie (relaxed fit, kangaroo pocket), peak seasonal demand in cold weather (winter/fall). Date 2019/12/30 (Mon, post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week): end-of-holiday period post-BF (P42:404), Cyber Monday (P43 low73), Christmas; expect continued moderate-high winter demand ~110-140 despite post-holiday dip, volatility from sales/events, but no major spike like BF; transition to Jan historical avg~78 possible soon. (b) Demand regime: Holiday peak P39-P42 avg240 extreme volatility confirmed; post-peak stabilization P43-P46 avg112.5 (73,129,137,111) -53% drop, sustained 4 periods, still elevated vs summer/fall but confirming end-holiday plateau (no further drop yet). Forecast P47 ~120 (recent avg), with spike risk. (c) LT variable 1-3 (recent ex: P42 LT3 P45, P43 LT2 P45); losses elevated (P1/3/26/29/34 etc. stuck in IT); P46 arrived=0 confirms P44 (250u P44) LT>=3 (missed expected LT2 P46); no new arrivals P46 signals ongoing delays/loss risk; treat promised LT2 conservatively as 2-3, high loss buffer needed. (d) OH=302 (covers ~2.5 periods @120dmd); IT=1880 inflated by chronic losses (est ~800-1000u lost: P1:300,P3:150,P4:?,P24:100?,P26:80,P29:120,P34:110 + priors); reliable pipeline ~900u, expect P47 arr ~550u (P44:250 LT3?, P45:300 LT2?), total post-P47 ~1100+OH ample 8+ periods but loss-risk adjusted to 4-5 periods coverage; ending P46 high OH from prior builds. (e) Order 250: Matches recent high-demand strategy (P42-46:250-300); replenishes pipeline accounting for LT=3/loss risk (cover 2-3 future periods post-expected arr, buffer volatility/spikes); balances stockout risk ($19p profit) vs holding ($1p, mitigated by sales); conservative vs massive IT but proactive for Jan winter sustainment/pre-drop.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Period 46: P44 order (250 units) LT>=3 confirmed (no P46 arrival expected LT=2); Post-holiday demand regime shift: P43-P46 avg 112.5 (-53% from P39-P42 avg 240), sustained 4 periods confirming stabilization/volatility end.",
