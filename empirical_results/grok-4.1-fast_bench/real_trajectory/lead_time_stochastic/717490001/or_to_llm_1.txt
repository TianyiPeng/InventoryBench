Inventory position: On-hand=969 (elevated from P45 arrivals of 250+350=600), in-transit=900 (unreliable, mostly lost per history), total pipeline covers 10+ periods even at 150 demand/day. Demand analysis: Recent P43-P45 avg=44 (42,39,50), sharp -67% drop from P39-P42 holiday peak avg=133; mid-Dec softening sustained 3 periods with low volatility. Current date 2019/12/23 (Christmas Eve week) could see casual t-shirt demand spike for gifts/last-minute, but recent trend dominates (low post-Black Friday), historical early-year ~70 aligns loosely, no evidence of Christmas surge for basic cat tees. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and all-history demand (ignores losses, recent drop, seasonality). Strategy: Follow OR at 0 - excessive inventory risks high holding costs ($969 this period alone), pipeline bloat unnecessary; on-hand alone buffers 20+ periods at recent low demand or 6+ at peak 150. Monitor for Christmas demand realization next period.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR's 0 units - on-hand 969 provides 20+ periods at recent low demand (P43-P45 avg 44) or 6+ at holiday peak 150; bloated in-transit 900 (72% losses) adds unreliable buffer, avoid exacerbating holding costs.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals sparse (P46 arrived=0); LT variability persists with history of LT=1-3 and losses (no new concludes); promised LT=2, but dry spell P37-P46 (10 periods) confirms persistent lost shipments bloating in-transit 900 (>=72% losses per carry-over). Inventory analysis: On-hand=936 covers 20+ periods at recent avg demand ~41 (P43-P46: 42,39,50,33); total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit)=1836 despite bloat. Demand analysis: Post-holiday slump sustained P43-P46 avg 41 (-69% vs P39-P42 avg133), low volatility (33-50), fits t-shirt category post-Christmas (Dec 23-30 dates) with no New Year's surge evident yet; historical early-year ~70 but recent regime dominates. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history (ignores regime shifts/losses). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - no order needed as inventory vastly exceeds (L+1)~3 periods demand (~120); avoid adding to bloated pipeline/holding costs ($936/period already).",
