Intermittent losses confirmed (carry-over), but recent P22 arrived promptly. Promised L=2 still relevant baseline. No arrivals expected in P24 (P23 order=0; prior recent orders already arrived or lost). 2.

On-hand=13 insufficient for expected P24 demand ~28 (will likely stockout ~15 units). 3.

No new concludes in P45 indicate pending arrivals for P46/P47 soon, but P44 order (120, expected P46 L=2) arrives after decision (visible P47). Inventory analysis: On-hand=64 (from P45 ending); in-transit=1208 mostly lost per carry-over (prior 808 lost + recent unarrived like P44=120 accumulating losses). Effective reliable pipeline ~0. Demand analysis: P46 date=2019/12/23 (Christmas Eve week); women's jersey leggings (everyday basics, winter/gift demand) expect major holiday surge - historical winter ~100 (Jan-Feb 92-104), rebound started P42=69/P43=76 (pre/Cyber), volatile dip P44=7/P45=36 (post-Cyber lull), but Christmas proximity drives 80-120+ demand forecast (calendar anchor over history). OR=0 flawed: uses full history (diluted by 25+ period trough avg~20-30) + promised L, ignores seasonality/holiday peaks/losses. Strategy: Override OR to 120 units (historical winter baseline + safety for L=2 cover of 3 periods x ~80=240 total need, minus on-hand 64; cap risk of losses by not overordering beyond proven highs).
