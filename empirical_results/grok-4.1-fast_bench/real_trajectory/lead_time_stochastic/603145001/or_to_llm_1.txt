Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but historical arrivals show mix of LT=1-2 when they occurred (e.g., P46 conclude has no arrivals; last arrivals pre-P24). No arrivals since P24 (23 straight periods through P46 conclude), confirming total supply chain breakdown with in-transit frozen at 838 (suspected lost backlog). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout continuing), in-transit=838 (covers decades at low demand or years at 100/demand). Demand analysis: Sustained ultra-low P26-P44 avg~22 (record lows <30), but P45=76 (Dec16), P46=97 (Dec23) signal holiday spike (+280% vs prior avg) for underwear (gifts/travel); P47=Dec30 New Year's may see continued moderate demand ~50-100, though not yet sustained 3+ periods for regime shift. Calendar knowledge: End-2019 holiday period drives underwear sales. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock minus massive pipeline <0, capped at 0; OR uses promised LT=2, full history mean pulled low by recent lows, ignores supply failure). Adjustment strategy: Follow OR's 0 exactly - massive frozen pipeline eliminates need for new orders (avoids adding to lost total ~938+); prioritize not exacerbating lost shipment pattern while monitoring demand recovery and supply resumption. Expected coverage: 838 in-transit theoretically ample if ever arrives, but realistically order 0 to halt backlog growth.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - 838 in-transit frozen for 23 periods (P24-P46) confirms supply breakdown, no new orders needed despite recent holiday demand spike (P45-P46 avg 86.5, +280% vs prior lows).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Supply breakdown streak hits 23 periods no arrivals (P24-P46), in-transit frozen at 838 confirming total supply failure; demand holiday spike signal strengthens: P45-P46 avg 86.5 (+280% vs P26-P44 avg~22), Dec16-23 Christmas surge for underwear, monitor P47 for sustainment beyond 3 periods.",
