Demand analysis: Holiday surge sustained through Christmas (P43-P46 avg 128.5: 128,137,137,112), post-Christmas P47 (12/30) likely tapering (P46 -18% vs P45), but leggings/tights winter demand remains elevated vs summer trough; no immediate stockout risk. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised L=2 and full history (ignores losses/delays, but aligns perfectly with massive pipeline reducing base-stock need). Strategy: Follow OR at 0 - pipeline excess justifies no order to minimize holding costs (profit=holding=$1, excess inventory drags R_t); monitor P47 conclude for arrivals to confirm pipeline integrity.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - in-transit 873 + on-hand 71 massively covers 5+ periods of recent ~130 demand during post-Christmas taper; avoid exacerbating holding costs from delayed/lost shipments.",
