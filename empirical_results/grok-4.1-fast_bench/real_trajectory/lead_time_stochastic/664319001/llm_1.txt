Calendar: Christmas proximity drives apparel sales up 100-300%+ vs off-peak. Historical initial data (Jan-Feb 2019 avg~17) irrelevant to holiday.(b) Demand regime: Carry-over confirms rebound P42-P44 avg31.7 (+282% vs P39-P41 8.3); P45=125 escalates (+938% vs P44=12, +244% vs P42-P44 avg), volatile but holiday uptrend accelerating into Christmas week (P43-P45 avg61.3 +93% vs P42-P44). Forecast P46: 200-300+ given proximity.(c) Lead-time/missing: Promised LT=2, actual 1-3 with frequent losses (carry-over: sustained pattern, e.g., P26(140) lost, no arrivals P31-P45). P44 order(200) expected P46 (LT=2, missed P45 LT1); high risk of loss inflating in-transit 1330 (ghosts). No new LT evidence.(d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=15 critically low (will stockout >15 demand even if no arrival). Possible P46 arrival=200 (P44 order LT2), yielding ~215 start (covers ~200 demand); post-P46 pipeline thin/unreliable (1330 in-transit mostly lost). High stockout risk P46-P47.(e) Order logic: Aggressive 300 to rebuild reliable pipeline for P48 (post-LT2), covering 200-300 demand x2 periods + safety vs losses/holiday peak; profit$4 > holding$1 justifies overstock vs sales loss.",

(b) Holiday volatile: P43=47, P44=12 (dip), P45=125 (surge), P46=92 (+high but -27% vs P45); avg P44-P46=76.3 (+24% vs P43-P45 61.3 noted), but volatility (dip/spike) prevents new 3-period regime confirmation; forecast P47-P49 avg 70 declining post-holiday (P46=92 confirmation of persistence but moderation signal). (c) LT 1-3 variable, sustained losses (no arrivals P31-P46=16 periods); P44(200) overdue 3 periods past exp P46 LT2 (absent P46 conclude); P46(300) possible LT1 P47 or LT2 P48; in-transit 1630 unreliable/inflated by losses.
