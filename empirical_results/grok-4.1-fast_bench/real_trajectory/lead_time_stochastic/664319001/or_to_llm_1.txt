{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised L=2, but history shows variability (1-3 periods) and persistent lost shipments (e.g., P44 order=100 expected P46 arrival not yet confirmed; total lost ~848+ units inflate in-transit to 1098 with low effective pipeline). Recent concludes show arrived=0 in P44-P45, pattern continues. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 after P45 stockout (demand=125 > 60 on-hand); in-transit unreliable due to chronic losses (carry-over confirms ~848 stuck). Demand analysis: Date 2019-12-23 is Christmas week (Dec 23-29), prime holiday shopping for women's trousers (gifts, parties); recent P42-45 demands 36/47/12/125 (avg 55, +450% vs P38-41 low avg10), P45=125 confirms spike after erratic early Dec. Summer peak faded, but holiday regime shift upward sustained 4 periods into Christmas. OR recommendation=0 ignores seasonality, recent highs, lost shipments inflating pipeline, and uses full history with fall lows; OR assumes stable i.i.d. but misses calendar-driven surges. Strategy: Override to aggressive order covering 2-3 periods high demand (~150/period x3=450, but cap conservatively accounting possible partial arrivals and holding risk) minus negligible effective pipeline; target base stock ~300-400, order 250 to avoid stockouts (lost profit $4/unit) while mindful of $1 holding.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Actual lead time varies 1-3 periods historically, but chronic lost shipments confirmed (no arrivals in P31-P46 concludes, 16-period dry spell; recent P44 order lost at P46, P45 order pending for P47 arrival with high loss risk). Lost pattern persists, inflating in-transit to 1348 (prior carry-over ~848+ lost); actual reliable pipeline ~0-100 (possible P45 100 if arrives). Inventory: on-hand=0, risking immediate stockout in P47 unless rare arrival; effective total inventory critically low despite listed in-transit. Demand analysis: Holiday regime P42-46 avg 62.4 (36,47,12,125,92), sustained spike confirmed into Christmas (P45=125 12/16, P46=92 12/23); P47 (12/30) post-Christmas/New Year's expects decline to ~40-60 (residual holiday/winter sales for women's trousers, but peak over; prior post-peak drops like summer-to-fall -40-80%). Calendar: Late Dec post-Christmas taper-off likely, no major spikes ahead. OR recommendation: 0 units - valid under its assumptions (promised L=2, full-history demand mean pulled low by early/fall periods, high listed pipeline), but ignores lost inflation and recent holiday volatility/regime. Adjustment strategy: Override OR 0 to 250 units - targets base stock ~ recent \u03bc\u0302=62*3=186 + z*\u03c3\u0302~70 safety (\u03c3~45 recent) for L=2+1 coverage; accounts for ~50% lost risk by overshooting; avoids further stockouts (recent P45-46 lost 60+92 sales=$600+ opp.); holding risk low at on-hand 0 and unreliable pipeline. Builds buffer for Jan winter/post-holiday uncertainty.",
