{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but total supplier blackout confirmed - no arrivals since P23 conclude (2019/7/15), persisting 24 periods through P46 conclude; in-transit frozen at 1700 units, all prior orders lost (8+ confirmed lost per carry-over). No recent LT observations possible due to blackout. Inventory: On-hand=349 (from P46 ending), covers 100+ periods at recent demand rates (~3/period); massive holding costs accruing ($349/period). Demand analysis: Persistent ultra-low regime since P21 (sustained 26 periods P21-46), recent P42-46 avg=3 (-98% vs P1-19 ~190); P46=1 confirms no rebound. Product is summer vest top (V-neck straps), Dec 30 winter date explains low demand, no NYE spike expected. OR rec=0 aligns perfectly - high inventory + low demand + blackout make ordering counterproductive (adds to lost pipeline, worsens holdings). Strategy: Order 0 to minimize holdings; let demand erode inventory slowly. No override needed.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - on-hand 349 vastly exceeds low winter demand (~3/period recent avg, sustained 26 periods) for summer vest top, plus 24-period supplier blackout confirms ordering is futile and risks more lost shipments.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand low levels declining further to ~3/period: P42-46 avg 3.0 (-98% vs P1-19 ~190), sustained 26 periods (P21-46) with P46=1 confirming continued decline; No arrivals persisting 24 periods (P23-P46 concludes), in-transit frozen at 1700 confirming total supplier blackout.",

Carry-over insight: Demand low levels declining further to ~3/period: P42-46 avg 3.0 (-98% vs P1-19 ~190), sustained 26 periods (P21-46) with P46=1 confirming continued decline; No arrivals persisting 24 periods (P23-P46 concludes), in-transit frozen at 1700 confirming total supplier blackout.
