No new LT shift. Lost shipments pattern sustained: in-transit 1070 matches carry-over ~1090 lost total (sporadic small arrivals like P38 70 units, but bulk undelivered indefinitely). Inventory: OH=24 insufficient for recent demand ~45 (P35-38 avg44, sells out P39 likely, lost sales ~20 units or $80 profit).

Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 504 (P45 end) covers ~28 periods at recent avg demand 18; in-transit 970 (likely mix of pending/lost per carry-over total ~1240 lost historically, but recent deliveries occurred). Demand analysis: Critically low sustained P40-45 avg 18 (22,18,33,9,8,20), 6 periods into Christmas Eve (2019/12/23); no holiday surge for lingerie despite proximity to Christmas (history shows P43-45=9,8,20 confirming decline continuation post-Black Friday/early Dec lows). Product is push-up bras/lingerie - gift potential minimal given trend. OR rec: 0 units (appropriate given promised LT2 + full history mean low now). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - zero order to avoid adding to massive overstock (holding cost $1/u/p vs profit $4); pipeline/on-hand sufficient for 50+ periods even at prior peaks.
