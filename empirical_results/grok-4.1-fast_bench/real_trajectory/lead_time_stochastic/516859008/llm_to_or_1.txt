Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), first decision, no prior period concludes or inventory/arrivals observed. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised L=2. Historical demand (5 weeks to 2019-02-04): 13,5,15,28,31; mean=18.4, std\u224810.85, showing upward trend (last 3 avg=24.7) post-Chinese New Year (Feb 5), but no confirmed sustained changepoint (dip in week 2). Women's belt accessory, minor potential Valentine's (Feb14) lift unconfirmed. Use defaults: backend computes mu_hat=3\xd718.4=55.2, sigma_hat=\u221a3\xd710.85\u224818.8 for base_stock=\u03bc\u0302 + \u03a6\u22121(0.95)\u03c3\u0302 (high service q=19/20=0.95), covering ~3 periods demand while capping overorder. No overdue shipments possible yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18), women's embossed leather belt. No major calendar events post-Valentine's (2/14). Demand history: historical 13(1/7),5(1/14),15(1/21),28(1/28),31(2/4); Period 1:39(2/11). Changepoint ~1/28: early mean~11 (first 3), recent regime mean~33 (last 3:28,31,39; +200%). On-hand=0, in-transit=37 (P1 order, expected arrive P3 w/ L=2). Last demand=39>pipeline cover. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent higher mean/volatility regime ((1+L)*33~99 for L=2). L=default (promised 2; no confirmed arrivals/lead times yet; P1 arrived=0 expected). High q=19/20=0.95 favors stock build vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift ~2019-01-28: recent 3 periods avg 33 (28,31,39) vs early 3 avg 11 (+200%)

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25), late February, women's belt accessory - no immediate holidays but demand surging post-Jan, consistent with carry-over regime shift ~2019-01-28. Observed demands: historical 13,5,15,28,31 + P1(2/11):39, P2(2/18):53. Recent 4 (1/28:28, 2/4:31, P1:39, P2:53) avg 37.75 vs early 3 avg 11 (+244%), sustained upward regime (4+ periods). No concluded arrivals yet (arrived=0 expected for LT=2; P1 order=37 arrives during P3, visible P4). In-transit=80 matches P1:37 + P2:43, no losses. On-hand=0, prior sales=0 due to stockouts on high demand. L default (no LT data). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to capture elevated mean/volatility over 1+L=3 periods (~113 demand forecast), raising base_stock for service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while capping avoids excess.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4, early March, women's embossed leather belt accessory). Demand surging: P1=39, P2=53 (+36%), P3=66 (+25%), avg last 3=52.7, confirming and extending carry-over high-demand regime shift ~2019-01-28 (prior recent avg33 vs early11). No seasonal drivers obvious (post-winter, pre-spring holidays). No arrivals in P1-P3 concludes (all arrived=0); P1 order (37u) overdue past promised L=2 (expected P3), total in-transit=137 (37+43+57) covers ~2-3 periods at ~55-60 demand/period. On-hand=0, risk stockout this period. Parameters: default L=2 (no confirmed arrivals/lead times to average); recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on sustained high-demand regime (N=3=min(regime_length=3+,20), changepoint evidence: consistent surge P1-P3 post-historical low-mean~18). Backend base_stock~(1+2)*52.7 + 1.645*sqrt(3)*~13.5 std ~158 + ~38=196, minus pipeline~137 \u2192 order ~59, targets high service (q=19/20=0.95) for profit max while holding low.

Carry-over insight: No arrivals in first 3 periods (arrived=0 each conclude); orders remain fully in-transit, P1 order overdue past L=2 confirming lead time delays or losses

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11, early March, no major holidays; women's basic hip belt accessory, steady non-seasonal demand). High demand regime persists: last 4 periods avg 52.5 (39,53,66,52 vs prior historical ~18), std~11; changepoint from historical low-demand confirmed. Pipeline=154 (on-hand=0): includes P1:37 (overdue, likely lost as no arrival by P4 conclude), P3:57 (expected P5 if LT=2), P4:60 (P6). Effective pipeline unreliable due to losses. Set L explicit=3 to cover extra period compensating for delays/losses (P1 missing past promised+1). mu_hat recent_4: (1+3)*52.5~210 to reflect regime. sigma_hat recent_4: sqrt(4)*11~22 for volatility. Boosts base_stock ~210 + 1.64*22 ~253 (q=19/20=0.95), order~253-154=99 (capped), ensures coverage despite losses, high service for profit vs low holding.

Carry-over insight: Shipment loss confirmed: P1 order (37u) no arrival by P4 conclude (placed P1, past promised L=2 arrival in P3); P2 order successful LT=2 (arrived P4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Mid-March, no major holidays/events for women's belt accessory; steady seasonal demand expected but recent pattern shows high demand P1-P4 (avg ~52.5) then sharp drop P5=26 (possible outlier/volatility). Pipeline=225u high but eroded by confirmed losses (P1=37u lost, P3=57u overdue past promised LT=2 no-arrival P5 conclude) + potential delays; actual coverage lower than appears, expect P4=60u arrive P6 if LT=2. Only 1 confirmed LT=2 (P2 order); losses/delays signal need longer horizon. Set L=explicit 3 to conservatively cover delays/losses (backend plans for 4 periods demand). mu_hat recent_5 (N=5, regime high-demand since ~P1 length=5>3) captures sustained shift up vs initial hist (mean47.2x4~189), smooths P5 dip. sigma_hat recent_5 (sd~15.2xsqrt4~30) for recent vol. High profit/holding ratio favors service; params inflate base_stock/pipeline target to offset losses, ensure coverage despite backend unawareness.

Carry-over insight: Shipment loss pattern persists: P3 order (57u) confirmed overdue/no arrival by P5 conclude (placed P3, past LT=2); now P1(37u)+P3(57u)=94u lost/delayed vs P2 success LT=2

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), late March, women's embossed leather hip belt - no major calendar events or strong seasonality expected (spring transition, steady accessory demand). Demands sustained high regime since P1 (avg 47 across P1-6, despite isolated P5 dip to 26; aligns with carry-over shift ~Jan28 to 33+). Pipeline total 193 (25 on-hand +168 in-transit) severely overstated: confirmed losses P1(37u, overdue past P4), P3(57u past P5), P4(60u past P6 expected LT=2), totaling 154u (~92% of in-transit); only P2(LT=2), P5(LT=1) successes. Observed LTs avg 1.5 but unreliable (40% success rate). To bridge OR backend's ignorance of losses (overstated pipe suppresses orders) and LT variability/losses, set L explicit=3 (effective buffer LT>promised 2); mu_hat recent_N=6 (regime length=6 since P1 shift, mean_period=47 \u2192 mu_hat=4*47=188); sigma_hat recent_N=6 (recent std~13.6 \u2192 sigma_hat=~27.2). Yields base_stock~188 + 1.645*27.2 \u2248188+45=233 >193 pipe (order~40, capped ~mu_per+1.645 sigma_per ~47+1.645*13.6~47+22=69), forcing restock to cover ~4 periods demand (~188) despite junk pipe, prioritizing high service (q=0.95) given profit>>holding.

Carry-over insight: Shipment loss pattern persists/worsens: P4 order (60u) confirmed lost (no arrival P6 conclude, expected LT=2 from P4); total lost/delayed P1(37u)+P3(57u)+P4(60u)=154u (~92% of 168u in-transit); success rate 2/5 orders (P2 LT=2, P5 LT=1); LT varies 1-2 on successes.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1): Early April, pre-Easter (Apr 21), steady spring demand for women's belt accessory expected ~48/unit/period based on sustained high-demand regime since ~2019-01-28 (carry-over). Recent demands P1-P7 avg 47.7 (39,53,66,52,26,46,52), with P5 dip anomaly but overall shift from hist avg~18 confirmed sustained (7+ periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=208 bloated by persistent losses/delays (~154u lost: P1=37,P3=57,P4=60; success rate ~28% 2/7 orders, LT=1-2 on successes avg1.5). Effective pipeline low (~P6=14+P7=40=54u). P7 conclude arrived=0 as expected (no orders due yet). To bridge OR backend's unawareness of losses/bloated pipeline, inflate L explicitly to 4 (buffer delays/losses beyond observed), mu_hat recent_7 for high regime (1+4)*47.7~191), sigma_hat recent_7 for volatility (early peaks P3=66); targets base_stock ~191 + 1.65*~sqrt(5)*18~191+65~256 >208, orders ~50+ to replenish assuming losses, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring pre-Easter (4/21 ~Period 11), women's belt accessory steady demand regime ~50/period recent 3 (P6-8:46,52,53 avg50.3; P5 26 single dip outlier, no sustained change). On-hand=1 low, pipeline=223 high w/ ~154u confirmed lost (P1=37 past P3, P3=57 past P5, P4=60 past P6; remain phantom in-transit indefinitely). Recent LT successes: P5 LT1, P6 LT2, P7 LT1 (avg~1.33 recent 3). To bridge phantom pipeline + loss risk, explicit L=3 (effective LT longer per missing shipment pattern). mu_hat recent_N N=3 (current regime post-dip, backend ~4*50.3=201). sigma_hat default (~sqrt4 * overall std~20=40, z\u03c3~66). Base_stock~267>223 enables order~44 (cap-limited ~83), balances service vs holding while rebuilding real supply.

Carry-over insight: Shipment success streak confirmed: last 3 orders P5-P7 all arrived (LT=1,2,1 avg1.33); losses limited to early P1-P4 (154u); success rate now 4/7 observed.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15, mid-spring, no major holidays/events for women's belts; stable non-seasonal demand). Demand sustained high regime ~50 (P6-P9: 46,52,53,52 avg 50.75, std~3.1; consistent post-P5 dip, no new changepoint). Confirmed losses P1(37u),P3(57u),P4(60u)=154u inflate in-transit to 262u (plus P8 69u expected arr P10 LT=2, P9 39u); on-hand=0 risks stockout vs recent D=52. Observed LTs (4 successes): P2 LT2, P5 LT1, P6 LT2, P7 LT1 (avg 1.5 < promised 2; recent pattern sustained). L recent_N N=4 uses avg~1.5 for accurate backend base_stock period. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=4 captures stable regime (mean 50.75*(1+1.5)~127; low vol sqrt(2.5)*3.1~4.9; z~1.64 for q=19/20=0.95 -> base_stock~135). High pipeline suppresses order-up-to, but params ensure modest order covers ~3pd demand if recent LT/success holds, balancing profit vs holding amid losses.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter (4/21); women's belt accessory, spring fashion demand possible but P10 spike to 95 likely Easter-related, not sustained. On-hand 13 low; in-transit 154u = confirmed lost early orders P1(37u LT> promised+multiple), P3(57u), P4(60u), no arrivals overdue past LT=2; recent pipeline arrives reliably. Demands recent P6-P10:46/52/53/52/95 avg59.6 (regime high ~50+ since P6, changepoint post-P5 low26; N=5 as regime_length=5). LT observed successes:6 values (P2:2,P5:1,P6:2,P7:1,P8:2,P9:1) avg1.5, recent stable 1-2. Use recent_N N=6 for L (avg1.5 vs promised2); recent_N N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect high demand/volatility ((1+1.5)*59.6~149 mu + safety~50 > pipeline167, orders ~30+ to cover despite lost pipeline); balances high profit(19)/low holding(1) favoring service vs overstock.

Carry-over insight: Shipment success streak extended: last 5 orders P5-P9 all arrived (LT=1,2,1,2,1 avg1.4); losses confined to early P1/P3/P4 (154u); recent success rate 5/5.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29), post-Easter (Apr 21); women's belt accessory, steady spring demand possible but recent high (P10:95, P11:64). On-hand=0, in-transit=223 (past losses P1/P3/P4 ~154u + recent like P11:69u). Demand regime high sustained since P1-P2 shift (carry-over), avg last 11 demands=54.4 (P1-P11:39-64 range). LT observations: 6 successes (P2:2,P5:1,P6:2,P7:1,P8:2,P9:1), avg=1.5, recent streak no losses. Use recent_N N=6 for L (avg~1.5 vs promised 2) to reflect shorter actual LT, reducing base stock exposure. recent_N N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on high-demand regime (ignores initial low historical), mu~(1+1.5)*54.4~136, sigma scaled accordingly. High q=19/20=0.95 ensures service despite vol/spikes; high pipeline suppresses overorder, balances holding vs stockout with inferred shorter L compensating past losses.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6, early May, no major holidays; women's belt accessory, steady spring demand possible). Recent demand changepoint at P10: P10-P12 demands 95,64,95 (avg 85, +63% vs prior ~52 avg P5-P9), sustained over 3 periods with stockouts (P12:95 lost). Early losses confirmed (P1/P3/P4=154u still bloating in-transit to 223u), but success streak holds (P5-P9 LTs 1-2; P11 order=69 pending, no arrival P12 expected LT=1/2). Reconcile: pipeline unreliable due to losses, on-hand=0 needs proactive ordering. L=recent_6 (all 6 observed LTs:2,1,2,1,2,1 avg1.5 < promised2, lowers base stock need). mu_hat=recent_3 (captures high-demand regime, backend (1+L)*85~ high base stock to cover spikes/service). sigma_hat=recent_3 (high vol std~18, boosts safety stock for q=19/20=0.95). Balances high service vs holding by using actual shorter L/recent high mu/sigma, avoiding overstock on unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: avg 85 (P10-P12:95,64,95) vs prior P5-P9 avg ~52 (+63%); success streak holds (no new losses confirmed P10-P12)

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13, mid-spring; women's basic hip belt - steady accessory demand, no major events). Recent demand regime shift at P10 sustained (P10-P13: 95,64,95,93 avg=86.75, +63% vs P5-P9 avg~52; regime_length=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=236 (includes early losses ~154u + recent like P13:82u). LT inference from 7 concluded successes (P2 LT2, P5:1, P6:2, P7:1, P8:2, P9:1, P11:2; avg~1.57, recent streak holds no new losses). Use recent_N N=7 for L to reflect observed avg LT~1.57 < promised 2, compensating for variability. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=4 for high-demand regime (backend: mu~(1+1.57)*86.75~227, sigma~sqrt(2.57)*13.6~22; targets base_stock covering ~2.6 periods demand). High pipeline cushions stockouts; params boost service amid losses/demand spike while capping overorder via backend logic (q=19/20=0.95 high service).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20), women's embossed leather hip belt (accessories); late spring/early summer, possible seasonal demand uptick. High demand regime sustained since P10 changepoint (P10-P14: 95,64,95,93,118; avg=93, std\u224819.2; +~80% vs prior ~52 avg). On-hand=0, recent stockouts P12 (95), P14 (118).

Parameters: L 'default'=2 (conservative buffer vs recent avg1.57 var); mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=5 (regime length=5 periods, sustained evidence).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27 Memorial Day, start of summer season for women's belt accessory - anticipate sustained high demand). Demand regime high since P10 changepoint (6 periods: P10-P15 demands 95,64,95,93,118,109 avg 95.7, sd~18.5, confirmed sustained >> early ~50). Escalating last 3 (P13-P15:93,118,109 avg107 +25%). On-hand=0, stockouts P12/P14/P15 (lost sales 95+118+109=322). In-transit=334u overstated: includes old lost 154u (P1/P3/P4) + new P13 82u overdue (no P15 arrival past LT=2) =236u lost, effective reliable pipeline ~98u (P14 68 + P15 30 pending). Recent LT successes avg~1.6 (last 5:2,1,2,1,2) but sporadic losses require buffer. Explicit L=3 inflates coverage to (1+3)=4 periods recent mean ~383 for base mu; recent_N N=6 (regime length=6 since P10 shift, evidence: sustained 6x high vs prior) for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures regime shift/volatility. q=19/20=0.95 z~1.65, expected base~383 + 1.65*sqrt(4)*18.5 ~383+61=444 >334 pipeline triggers order ~110u to cover upcoming demand despite losses, prioritizing profit from sales over holding.

Carry-over insight: P13 order (82u) loss confirmed overdue past LT=2 (no P15 arrival); sporadic loss pattern persists (total lost/delayed 236u /71% of 334u in-transit), breaking P5-P11 success streak; Demand escalation at P13: avg107 (P13-P15:93,118,109) vs P10-P12 85 (+25%, sustained 3 periods); Memorial Day (P16 2019-05-27) aligns with summer accessory demand spike.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03), early summer; women's belt/accessories demand sustained high post-Memorial Day (P16). Recent demand regime P13-P16: 93,118,109,89 avg 102 (+20% vs P10-P12 avg85, sustained 4 periods confirming carry-over escalation). On-hand=0, in-transit=444u bloated w/ confirmed lost 304u (P1:37,P3:57,P4:60,P13:82,P14:68; P14 loss new: placed P14, no P16 arr past LT=2). Effective pipeline low, stockouts P12/P14-16. Observed success LTs avg~1.6 (last 7:2,1,2,1,2,1,2) but sporadic losses require longer L to inflate base_stock >444 despite stuck in-transit (OR blind to losses). Set L explicit=4 (LT+loss buffer), mu_hat recent_N=4 (high regime length=4, N=4), sigma_hat recent_N=4 (low vol~12.7/period). Yields mu_hat=5*102.25=511, sigma_hat~sqrt5*12.7=28.4, base~558 (z=1.645@q=0.95), order~114 (min(114,cap~123)) to cover ~4-5 periods demand w/ safety, prioritizing profit from sales over holding.

Carry-over insight: P14 order (68u) loss confirmed (no P16 arrival, overdue past LT=2); total lost/delayed 304u (~68% of 444u in-transit), sporadic loss pattern persists; high demand regime sustained P13-P16 avg102 (+20% vs P10-P12 avg85, now 4 periods).

Recent 5 observed LTs (P17: LT2 P15/P16 LT1; P13: LT2 P11; P10: LT2/1 P8/P9): 2,1,2,2,1 avg1.6.

On-hand 10 (vulnerable, expect stockout post-demand), in-transit 422 but ~304u known lost/delayed (P1/3/4/13/14; ~70% of pipeline ghost inventory per prior), effective pipeline ~118u (likely P17 118 LT=2 pending this period) covers <2 periods at 80 dmd/period.

Explicit mu_hat=550 (equiv ~215/period over 2.56 per, ~2.4x recent 88 inflated for ~60% success rate/loss compensation to offset ghost pipeline), sigma_hat=40 (inflated ~2x recent std for loss/demand vol uncertainty).

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24), late June summer period for women's embossed leather hip belt accessory; post-Memorial Day (P16 5/27) demand high regime from P13 sustained but de-escalating P17-P19 avg71 (-30% vs P13-P16 102). Upcoming July 4 (P21 ~7/1) may spike demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=606 heavily overstated (est. ~422u lost: prior 304u + P13=82 + P14=68 + P17=118 confirmed no P19 arr; sporadic losses ~70%). Recent successful LTs last 5: P16=1, P15=2, P11=2, P9=1, P8=2 avg1.6. Recent demand regime P13-P19 (7pd post-shift) avg89 volatile. L recent_N=5 uses avg1.6 successes; mu_hat recent_N=7 scales to ~(1+1.6)*89=231 (covers ~3pd despite losses); sigma_hat recent_N=7 captures high vol ~20. Elevates base_stock >>606 pipeline (z~1.64 high q=19/20=0.95) to force ordering/safety buffer compensating unobservable losses, cap auto-limits excess.

Upcoming July 4 (Thu in P21 week) may spike accessory demand, but use recent regime. On-hand=0 (P20 stockout 64u, lost $1216 profit). In-transit=606u (~70% ghosts/lost ~422u per carry-over, effective ~184u covering ~2.6 periods). No arrivals P18-P20; sporadic losses persist (P19 184u missed LT=1 in P20, likely >=2 or lost, confirmation pending P21 conclude). Expected P21 arrivals: poss. P19 LT=2. Reconcile overdue: consistent with pattern, no new confirmed losses. Parameters: L default=2 (promised conservative despite recent successes avg~1.6); mu_hat explicit=850 targets base_stock~873 (850 + 1.65*14) >606+267=873 forcing order~267u (min(267, cap~296)); sigma_hat recent_4 (sqrt(3)*8.1~14, z*14~23) uses calm regime vol.

Summer accessory belt demand stable low-vol post-July 4 (P21=73 no spike). On-hand=0, in-transit=877 bloated (sporadic losses ~70% rate per history, e.g., P19 184u lost confirmed no P21 arrival past LT=2; total lost est. 606u+). Recent LT successes avg~1.5 but unreliable. Set L=explicit 12 to inflate base_stock~(13*70 + 1.645*sqrt(13)*8.25)\u2248959 >877, yielding order\u224882 (near cap\u224884=70+1.645*8.25), bridging lost pipeline gap by targeting higher coverage while cap limits sensible qty. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=5 anchors current regime (changepoint P17 de-escalation evidence: sustained 5 periods low mean/var).

On-hand=0, in-transit=959u but historical arrival rate only 34% (485 arrived /1444 total ordered), phantom/lost ~66% (~634u), expected arriving pipeline ~120u (P21 271u *0.34\u224892 + P22 82u *0.34\u224828). True target base_stock for L=2: 3*80=240 mu + z*~20 sigma_hat (recent sqrt(3)*11.5 std) \u2248240+33=273; desired order \u2248273-120=153. To offset phantom pipeline (backend subtracts full 959u), inflate param base_stock to 959+153 + margin=1200 via explicit mu_hat=1160, sigma_hat=25 (z*25\u224841, total base\u22481201, order\u2248242 clipped by cap~ mu/2.56 + z sigma/sqrt(2.56)\u22481160/2.56\u2248453 +41/1.6\u224826=479). L=calculate (9 observed LTs:1,2 avg1.56) uses true avg successful LT for accurate cap scaling; addresses losses by inflating targets to force ordering despite bloated pipeline.

Recent demand stable post-Memorial de-escalation: P17-P26 avg 69.8 (10 periods, range 38-90, P24=38 outlier low); confirms sustained regime vs earlier spikes (P13-16 ~102). On-hand 338 covers ~5 periods at 70/demand; in-transit 925 inflated by ~66% historical losses (early + sporadic like P17,19 overdue past L=2+3).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19), late summer; women's embossed leather hip belt (accessory) may see back-to-school demand uptick soon (late Aug/Early Sep). Recent demand stable ~72 avg (P25-27:73,66,78; P24:38 outlier low), post prior de-escalation/up-tick regimes. On-hand 260 covers ~3.5wks@72; in-transit 925 w/ persistent sporadic losses (~66% rate per carry-over P23, expected delivery 0.34*925~314), effective position ~574 (~8wks). Reconcile pipeline: recent arrivals sparse (P27/P25/P24=0; successes P26 LT3 P23-order, P23 LT2/1); overdue/losses continue (e.g., P24/P25/P19/etc.). Backend assumes full pipeline=1185 arrives, orders 0 w/ default (base~280<<1185). Inflate mu_hat explicit=1410 targets base~1410 + z*~43*sqrt(2.8)~1410+110~1520, order~1520-1185=335 (cap~1410/2.8 +1.645*~25*sqrt(2.8)/sqrt(2.8)~500+45~545 sufficient). L recent_5 avg1.8 (last successes LTs: P26-arr P23=3, P23-arr P21=2/P22=1, P17-arr P15=2/P16=1) uses recent delivery evidence vs promised 2. Sigma default uses full history std scaled. Params force proactive ordering to cover losses/possible BTS spike, prioritizing high q=19/20 service vs low holding.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

IP=169 OH +1231 IT=1400 bloated by persistent sporadic losses (~66% hist success rate, e.g. P24 ord90 overdue past LT2 no P26 arr, P26 ord229 overdue no P28 arr, total ghosts ~800+u).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02 Labor Day holiday): women's embossed leather hip belt accessory; potential demand fluctuation around Labor Day/end-of-summer/back-to-school. Recent demand stable in post-P21 uptick regime, avg 75.2 (P25-29:73,66,78,91,68; std~9.3) vs earlier spikes (P13-16 avg102, de-escalation P17-20 avg69). On-hand 101 covers ~1.3 recent periods; in-transit 1460 unreliable (~66% historical loss rate, sporadic no-arrivals persist: P27-29 arrived=0, P28/P29 orders 306u+229u at risk). Confirmed LTs recent avg1.8 (last 5 successes: P23@LT3, P21@2, P22@1, P15@2, P16@1). Set L recent_5 to reflect shortened recent LT avg< promised 2 (prompts more aggressive reordering via lower base stock target but compensates losses via turnover). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 for current stable low-vol regime (ignores early high vol/changepoints). Ensures OR backend targets ~227 mean demand over 2.8 periods + high z*~15 vol (q=19/20=0.95), inflating orders to buffer losses while minimizing hold on unreliable pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09), early September post-Labor Day (P30 2019-09-02), back-to-school season likely sustaining demand for women's belt accessories around 70-100. Demand regime shift at P21 confirmed sustained (P21-P30: 10 periods, avg 75.6, median 75, outlier P24=38; recent P27-P30 avg 83.8). High inventory: on-hand 309 (covers ~4 periods at 80/demand), in-transit 1154 inflated by ~66% historical losses (e.g., recent P24=90u lost overdue LT=6+ confirmed no P26-P30 arrival; P26=229u lost overdue LT=4+ no P28-P30). Recent LTs stable avg~2 (last 5 obs: P30 LT2 P28, P26 LT3 P23, P23 LT2 P21 & LT1 P22). Parameters use recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat capturing elevated regime mean~76/vol high~20 (vs all-history lower); recent_N=5 for L=2.0. Higher recent mu_hat scales base_stock up vs default, countering fake pipeline inflation from losses to encourage ordering despite high nominal inventory, balancing stockouts vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Sporadic loss pattern persists: P24 order (90u) confirmed lost (no arrival P26-P30 concludes, overdue 6+ periods past LT=2); P26 order (229u) confirmed lost (no P28-P30, overdue 4+); recent success limited to P28 LT=2

LLM Rationale:

Current on-hand 207 covers ~2 recent demands (~90-100); in-transit 1154 bloated with lost shipments (e.g., P29 229u lost confirmed no P31 arrival overdue LT=2; prior P24 90u, P26 229u lost; sporadic ~66% historical loss rate persists). Demand regime uptick from P21 sustained 11 periods (P21-P31 demands avg 78, range 38-102, vs P17-P20 avg ~71 +10% sustained >>3 periods). Recent LT observations (last 6 successes: P17 LTs 2&1, P23 2&1, P26 3, P30 2) avg ~1.83. No new changepoints. Parameters: recent_N N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat weights high-demand regime (mean~78, sd~17.9 inflated by P24 outlier but sustained); recent_N N=6 for L uses recent LT avg~1.83 (vs promised 2). Adjusts OR for actual LT while higher mu/sigma boosts base-stock ~ (1+1.83)*78 + 1.645*sqrt(1+1.83)*17.9 ~245, countering losses/unreliable pipeline to prioritize sales (high profit 19>>holding 1) over risk of stockouts.

All 1154u in-transit confirmed lost (specific overdue orders: P1:37,P3:57,P4:60,P13:82,P14:68,P17:118,P19:184,P24:90,P26:229,P29:229 sum=1154u, no arrivals expected); effective position=115 on-hand only (~1 period demand coverage at 90/period, stockout risk P34+ without new orders). Recent LT successes avg~1.83 (last 6 obs:2,3,2,1,2,1). Backend pipeline overstated by 1154u lost; compensate via explicit high mu_hat=1500 (~5x normal 3*90=270 to inflate base_stock=target 600 + lost 1154~1754), sigma_hat=200 (inflated ~8x normal 24 for safety); base~1500+1.645*200~1829>1269 pipeline, order~560; L=default=2 gives cap~1500/3 +329/1.73~500+190~690>560. Builds effective position to ~115+560=675 (~7.5 periods safety buffer given ~55% hist success risk, low holding cost).

Carry-over insight: All 1154u in-transit confirmed fully lost (specific orders P1:37u + P3:57u + P4:60u + P13:82u + P14:68u + P17:118u + P19:184u + P24:90u + P26:229u + P29:229u =1154u, all overdue 4+ periods past LT=2 with no arrival); expected future arrivals from pipeline=0; effective inventory=on-hand only (sustained realization Period 33).

Effective reliable pipeline~0 (historical success~34%, sporadic losses persist). Recent demand regime shift P31: P31-P33 avg120.3 (102,92,167) vs P28-P30 avg85.7 (+40%, sustained 3p, fall season alignment for accessories/belts). High vol std~40.7 last3. Recent LTs (last5 obs: P28 LT2, P23 LT3, P21 LT2, P22 LT1, P15 LT2 avg=2.0). To counter fake pipeline bloat & enable ordering in high-demand/lossy env, explicit mu_hat=2300 >>1714 inflates base_stock~2416 (w/ sigma contrib~116) for deficit~702u & cap~2300/3 + contrib~834 (L~2), yielding order~702u to build buffer vs stockouts/unreliable supply. Sigma recent_3 captures regime vol changepoint. L recent_5 uses sustained recent LT regime (no new LT shift). Addresses losses by forcing OR to ignore phantom transit via override.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21): Fall season, steady demand expected for women's leather belt accessory, no immediate holidays (Halloween ~10 days away). Recent demand regime shift at P31 sustained P31-P36 avg 111 (102,92,167,123,77,107) vs prior P28-P30 avg86 (+29%, 6 periods). On-hand 1031 covers ~9 periods at 111/demand; in-transit 2462 (P34:703 overdue past LT=2 no P36 arr., likely lost; P36:605 recent) but sporadic ~66% loss rate persists, effective pipeline unreliable.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28, Halloween week approaching Oct 31; women's embossed leather hip belt accessory may see costume/fashion demand uptick). Recent demand regime high sustained P28-P37 avg 107.8 (N=10), continuing P31 shift (+40% vs prior). Real position strong: on-hand 878 covers ~5-6 periods at 150/demand; real in-transit only P36 order 605u (expected LT~2 arrive P38); confirmed lost=1857u (prior 1154u + P34 703u overdue >LT=3 no P36/P37 arrival), phantom inflates seen position 3340 but real ~1483 >> target base ~387. Order 0 optimal to avoid excess amid 60-70% loss rate. Recent LTs (last 10 obs: 1,3,2,3,1,2,1,2,2,1 avg 1.8) reflect variability; recent_N=10 for all params uses current regime/vol ~31 std for mu_hat=(2.8)*107.8~302, sigma_hat~52, base~387 (q=19/20=0.95 z~1.65), cap~159 balancing service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: P34 order (703u) loss confirmed (no arrival P36-P37, overdue past LT=3); total lost 1857u (1154u prior +703u), real in-transit reduced to 605u (P36 only); ~60-70% loss rate sustained with identifiable pipeline composition.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): Pre-holiday season (Thanksgiving ~P42 Nov28, Black Friday Nov29, Christmas ~P46); anticipate demand escalation for women's belt accessory amid shopping surge, building on sustained high regime since P31 shift (P31-P38 demands avg 114.4: 102/92/167/123/77/107/153/94, std~31). On-hand 784 covers ~7 recent-demand periods; in-transit 2462u fully lost/delayed (matches prior 1857u + P36 605u overdue past LT=2, no P38 arrival; sporadic ~65% loss rate persists, effective pipeline=0). Reconcile: backend overstates pipeline, so elevate L to buffer unreliability/delays (recent success LTs last 10 obs avg~1.9, but losses necessitate conservatism). Set L explicit=3 for 4-period coverage; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=8 (regime length=8>=3, captures high mean/volatility); yields ~mu=456, sigma~62; high z*(q=19/20=0.95) prioritizes service to exploit profit amid supply risk/seasonal upside, counters overstated pipeline subtraction.

Carry-over insight: P36 order (605u) loss confirmed (no arrival P38 conclude, overdue past LT=2); all 2462u in-transit now fully lost/delayed (1857u prior +605u, expected future arrivals=0); sporadic loss pattern persists unabated.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11), pre-holiday season (Thanksgiving 11/28 P42, Black Friday 11/29) for women's belt accessory; anticipate demand escalation similar to prior Memorial Day spike. Demand regime shift at P31 confirmed sustained 9 periods P31-P39 avg 112 (1011/9) vs P28-P30 avg86 (+30%); high volatility std~30. All in-transit 1857u lost/delayed (overdue per prior insights, expected arrivals=0), inflated pipeline=3150 equiv ~28x recent demand; on-hand 1293 covers ~11 periods. Recent LT successes avg~2 but losses ~66% persist. Set L explicit 28 to yield base_stock~(1+28)*112 +1.645*sqrt(29)*30 ~3257+266=3523 >3150, forcing order=cap~(112 +1.645*30)~160u/period despite inflated pipeline, rebuilding ahead of holiday while recent_N=9 mu_hat/sigma_hat captures regime (N=9=regime length).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18), approaching Thanksgiving (11/28), Black Friday (11/29), Christmas; belts/accessories likely see holiday gift demand spike (+25-50% potential, per prior Memorial Day pattern). On-hand 1185 covers ~11 periods at recent mean~112/d; in-transit 2019 inflated by ~70% historical ghost shipments (expected real supply ~600 sporadic). Pipeline total~3204. High demand regime sustained since P31 changepoint (P31-P40: 10 periods, mean=111.9, std~32). Recent LTs avg~2.25 (last 4 obs: 3,3,1,2) but sporadic losses require effective LT inflation. Set L explicit=28 (to scale base_stock over ~29 periods~3248+ covering ghosts/loss-adjusted horizon). mu_hat recent_10 (regime length=10) scales to 29*111.9~3248. sigma_hat recent_10 scales to sqrt(29)*32~173. Base_stock~3248+1.64*173~3524>3204 (order~320>0). Caps at recent mean+1.64*std~112+52=164 (realistic holiday buffer), ensuring backend orders despite ghosts, high service q=0.95 vs low holding.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25): Black Friday/Thanksgiving week onset (Nov 28/29), major retail holiday for women's fashion accessories (belts); anticipate demand spike 150-250+ vs recent avg~110 (P36-P41 demands:107,153,94,96,108,106 avg110.7, std~22), building on P31+ regime ~120 with spikes to167/153. On-hand 1079 covers ~5-10wks at baseline but marginal for 6 remaining periods/300wk holiday peaks (~1800 total). In-transit 2178 bloated (e.g., P34 703u overdue 7+ periods past LT=2, total historical losses ~70% sustained); effective pipeline ~1079 OH only, no reliable future arrivals expected. Recent LT observations (P39 LT3 P36; P36 LT3 P33/LT1 P35; P30 LT2 P28) avg~2.25 last4, consistent w/ default L=2 successes amid losses.

On-hand 1235 covers ~10-12wks at 100/wk but holding costs $1u/p; in-transit 2465 bloated by confirmed historical losses (e.g., P42 608 pending, prior 2462u lost per carry-over) unreliable pipeline. Recent LT successes avg~2.2-2.3 (last 6-9 obs: LT=3,2,3,3,1,2,...), frequent LT=3 + losses warrant explicit L=3 for extended (1+3=4wk) coverage. mu_hat explicit=520=4*130 targets base_stock ~620 (z~1.645*60), countering fake-high pipeline to encourage ordering ahead of spike despite cap. sigma_hat explicit=60 (~sqrt(4)*27 recent_10 std) captures vol for high service q=0.95.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): Pre-Christmas week (Dec 23-29), major holiday spike expected for women's accessory belt (gifting/outfits); recent demands P43-45: 50 (post-Thanksgiving dip), 83, 127 (rising +53% last 2, avg 87 but accelerating). High on-hand 1633 covers ~10-13 periods at 120-150/demand, but in-transit 1857 bloated with indefinite historical lost shipments (~60-70% loss rate per carry-over, successes LT=1-3 avg~2.5 recent 6: 3,3,2,3,3,1). Backend subtracts full phantom pipeline ~3490, underorders critically for spike. Compensate with explicit L=4 (recent avg LT 2.5 + loss buffer for longer effective horizon), explicit mu_hat=4200 (~5 periods x 200 holiday forecast +2500 phantom adjustment, inflated for service), explicit sigma_hat=400 (elevated volatility ~30 recent std inflated x sqrt(5)~2.2 + buffer, z*sigma~660, base_stock~4200+660=4860 >>3490 targeting ~1000u order). Cap ~4200/5 +1.645*400/sqrt5 ~840+370=1210 sufficient. Balances high profit service vs low holding by front-loading holiday stock despite phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Christmas demand escalation P44-P45: 83 to 127 (+53%), sustained rising pattern 3 periods P43-P45 avg87 with acceleration post-dip, aligned with Dec23 holiday spike for accessories (+45% vs P40-P42 avg110).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30), post-Christmas (after P46 12/23 holiday week demand=100, down 21% from P45=127). Women's leather hip belt likely sees post-holiday demand drop/de-escalation similar to early-year lows (~10-60) or prior dips (e.g., P43 Dec2=50), ending Christmas spike noted in carry-over. On-hand=1533 covers 15+ periods at 100 demand; in-transit=2992 but sporadic 60-70% loss rate (carry-over) implies ~900 expected arrivals (unreliable timing). No new losses confirmed (P46 arrived=0 expected for LT>=1; P46 order=1135 not overdue). Recent observed LTs (last 5: P45 LT3, P43 LT3&2, P39 LT3) avg=2.8, signaling drift > promised L=2. Recent demand regime high ~100 (P37-P46 avg=103, sustained 10+ periods post-P31 shift); no confirmed post-holiday drop yet (needs 3+ periods). Set L recent_5 for avg~2.8 (higher L scales mu/sigma up ~19% vs L=2, compensating LT drift/losses by inflating base_stock vs unreliable pipeline). mu_hat recent_10 (103*~3.8=~392, maintains high service for potential Jan low-season ramp). sigma_hat recent_10 (captures holiday volatility ~30-40). Backend orders conservatively given high effective inventory, minimizing holding while buffering losses/stockouts (q~19/20=0.95 service).
