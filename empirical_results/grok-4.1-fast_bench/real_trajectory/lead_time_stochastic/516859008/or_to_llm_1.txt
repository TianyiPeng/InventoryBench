Carry-over notes LT variability persists; treat as unreliable ~1-3 periods. Pipeline shows 852 in-transit, but per P26 carry-over all prior 582 were ghosts (lost), and recent orders P26=100, P27=80, P28=80, P29=90 total ~350 more likely ghosts too (total ~932 mismatch close to 852 shown), so effectively no reliable live pipeline - high risk of continued ghosts/stockouts. 2. INVENTORY & PIPELINE ANALYSIS: On-hand=0 entering P30; recent P27-P29 all ended with 0 or low, multiple full stockouts (P28 sold=0 demand=91, P29 sold=0 demand=68). Ghosts dominate in-transit, cannot rely on arrivals this period. 3. DEMAND ANALYSIS: Recent P25-P29 demands 73,66,78,91,68 avg 75.2 (sustained rebound +3% from P25-P28 avg77 per carry-over, +89%+ vs summer low P24=38). Early Sep (9/2 Labor Day week) may see end-of-summer/back-to-school boost for women's accessories belt, but conservative at ~75-90/period. Historical initial low (~18 avg) irrelevant; OR uses that + promised LT=2, sees high pipeline vs low mu_hat, caps at 0. 4. STRATEGY: Override OR 0 as it ignores ghosts, recent demand regime (75 avg), LT variability, and stockout streak. Target base stock for (LT+1)=~3 periods demand ~225, but cap order at 90 to match recent avg + safety for Labor Day volatility/ghost risk; ensures coverage post-stockouts without overorder given holding cost.",

Product is women's embossed leather belt - fall fashion relevant, no strong seasonal dip. OR recommendation: 0 units - underestimates due to all-history mean skewed low by early periods (avg ~20-30), ignores recent regime shift to 100+ and ghosts.

No new concludes in P46 (arrived=0) confirm losses yet for recent orders like P44(250, exp P46 LT2), P43(300, possible LT3), P45(250 LT1), but fits ghost pattern (prior total ~1100+ ghosts).

Demand analysis: Holiday surge extended post-Christmas (P44-P46:83,127,100 avg~103; overall P31-P46 long-term avg ~105 sustained 16 periods per carry-overs); volatile but high into late Dec (P46=100 fits ramp).
