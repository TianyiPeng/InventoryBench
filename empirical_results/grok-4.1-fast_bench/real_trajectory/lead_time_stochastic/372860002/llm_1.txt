(b) Demand regime: Sustained post-summer dip lows into late Nov (P36-41 avg ~110, per carry-over); P42=182 (+106% vs P41=88) signals holiday rebound start, volatile post-dip (P40-42 avg 122 still low but uptick). Forecast P43: 250-350 (Cyber Monday + holiday ramp-up, vs historical winter ~70 but sim baseline 200-400 peaks). No new sustained regime (needs 3+ periods). (c) Lead time: Promised 2, actual variable 1-3 (recent ex: P39 LT2, P36 LT3); persistent lost orders (carry-over: P38 200u lost, many prior 450u+ never arrived, in-transit 4950 bloated with ghosts). P42 conclude arrived=0 (P40 order? overdue reinforces losses). No new confirmed losses this period. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 248 (P42 end, covers ~1 low demand period); in-transit 4950 unreliable (lost pattern, don't count >10-20% reliable). Pipeline risky, no expected near arrivals (P42 arr=0). (e) Order logic: Order 300 to cover P43-45 demand (~250-300/period holiday forecast) post-lead time, build buffer vs losses/uncertainty despite holding cost (profit=holding=1, prioritize sales). Conservative ramp from recent 200s, avoid overstock with volatile lows but proactive for Dec peaks (P46 Christmas).",
