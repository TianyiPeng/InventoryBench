No immediate holidays but back-to-school tailwind possible. (b) Demand regime: Fall peak confirmed/surging P30-32: 88,106,142 (avg112 sd27, +15% vs P30-31 avg97, +42% vs P21-26 ~30); 3+ periods sustained highs>100 matching hist~80-100 and seasonal lift; volatility sd27 but upward trend prevents downside risk underestimation; forecast P33 ~110-140.

(e) Order logic: Order 140 to cover ~1x expected demand (112) + safety for LT3+stockout (recent 142 high) - minimal expected immediate arr (conservative); balances sales capture ($19P) vs holding ($1); high order replenishes pipeline post-P32 depletion while bloated transit holds distant buffer.",
