{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but recent variability confirmed (LT=1-3); P42 LT3 arr P45, P43 LT2 arr P45, P44 order 250 overdue past LT=2 (no arr P46 conclude), likely LT=3 arr during P47 (visible P48); P45 order 250 expected LT=2 arr P47. Historical losses accumulate in in-transit (593 historical + P44 250 + P45 250 =1093 total). Inventory: On-hand 144 sufficient for 2+ periods at recent demand; expected P47 arrivals ~500 (P44+P45) would balloon inventory. Demand analysis: Holiday surge P42-45 avg~132 (BF P42=227), but P46=72 (-45%), post-Christmas 12/30 likely continued softening (New Year's not belt driver); recent non-holiday avg~50-100. OR recommends 0 (uses promised LT=2, full history avg low ~70, high pipeline caps order_raw to 0). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - no need to order with 144 on-hand + ~500 imminent arrivals + loss-inflated pipeline; prioritize avoiding holding costs ($1/unit/period) during post-holiday lull.
