  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: No new concluded arrivals in P46; prior pattern shows LT=3 sustained (e.g., P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30), promised LT=2, so plan for LT=2-3. Pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=872 (massive buffer from prior orders, sufficient for 40+ periods at recent ~15-20 avg demand). Demand analysis: Low winter regime sustained P40-P46 avg ~12 (14,7,19,9,7,14,18), consistent low teens/single digits into late Dec post-Christmas with no holiday spike as per carry-over; product is baby t-shirt (seasonally low in winter, no NYE demand driver). OR recommendation: 0 units, using historical data/promised LT=2, but aligns perfectly with reality (low demand, huge pipeline, no regime shift). Strategy: Follow OR at 0 - avoid adding to future holding costs ($1/unit/period) given ample coverage for (L+1)=3-4 periods ahead and beyond; stockouts unlikely short-term due to in-transit.",
