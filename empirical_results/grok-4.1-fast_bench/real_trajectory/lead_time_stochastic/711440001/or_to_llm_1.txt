OR recommendation=0: Uses promised LT=2 + full-history demand (pulled low by long off-season lows avg~30-40), ignores seasonality/unreliability - underestimates holiday surge. Strategy: Override OR 0 to 100 units - modest build to hedge pipeline unreliability/delays for LT=3+ covering P45-47 Christmas demand (est. 150+/period), while high position avoids overstock; ensures coverage for potential 150+ P42-43 spikes without excess holding (q=0.5 balanced).",
