Historical early-year Jan-Feb avg~30 aligns with current low winter regime. (b) Demand regime: Late fall decline sustained ~42 avg P37-P40/P41; volatile late Nov P42=115 (Thanksgiving/Black Friday spike), sharp drop P43=23 (-80%); forecast P44~25-35 (early Dec post-holiday normalization, defying Christmas uptick for non-gift summer item); no sustained new regime (1 period drop <3). (c) Lead-time/missing orders: Variability sustained 1-3 periods (recent reconfirms); no arrivals P40-P43 (4 periods), extending loss pattern (P42 order120 exp P44 LT2 at risk/missed already in pattern); bloated in-transit1530 reflects cumulative undelivered/lost (historical ~300u+ lost batches). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=5 (critically low, risks partial stockout P44 if demand>5); in-transit=1530 unreliable (high loss risk, bloated per insights, minimal expected near-term arrivals given recent misses). Pipeline covers far excess of remaining ~4 periods low demand (~120 total) if any arrives, but losses erode effective supply. (e) Final order logic: Order 50 - conservative cover for 1-2 periods low demand (~30/period) post-P44 (LT2-3 arrival P46-47), prioritizing service level vs holding (avoid excess atop bloated pipeline); 0 risks multi-period stockouts if pipeline fully lost, but low absolute order minimizes added holding given endgame (P44/47) and winter trough.",
