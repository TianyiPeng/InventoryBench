(d) Inv&pipeline: On-hand=85 (covers ~2p at 40/d); transit=2460 unreliable (cumulative losses ~prior 2310+new orders, no recent arr). (e) Order logic: Endgame (P45/47, 3p left); low demand forecast; sufficient on-hand for coverage despite unreliable pipeline; order 0 minimizes holding ($1/u/p) & lost bloat risk, prioritizes avoiding excess inv penalty over minor stockout risk (low profit opp ~40u*19=$760 vs hold 85*1*3p=$255).",

Recent P43-45 (Dec2-16) low 42/34/51 confirms post-CM trough, no pre-Xmas surge yet. (b) Demand regime: Winter low sustained P43-45 avg42 (range34-51 low vol, -60% vs P40-42 holiday110), 3p evidence extending P36-39 avg46 regime w/ Dec cooling. Forecast P46 ~50-80 conservative (low base + mild Xmas lift).

No new LT shift. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand734 covers 10-15p at forecast50-80 (+exp P44 150 P46 + partial transit). Transit1760 bloated (priors lost ~decades units), high buffer vs low demand. (e) Order logic: Order 0; excessive on-hand/transit buffers winter lows & potential mild Xmas (~70); avoids bloat amid loss risk. Holding cost offset by sales profit (19>>1), prioritizes avoiding overorder waste.",

(b) Demand regime: Winter low sustained P43-46 avg42 (42,34,51,40; low vol range17, -60% vs P40-42 holiday110); P46=40 confirms post-Christmas extension (no surge).
