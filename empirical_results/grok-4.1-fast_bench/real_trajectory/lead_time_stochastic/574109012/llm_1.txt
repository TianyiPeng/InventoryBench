  "rationale": "(a) Product: Long-sleeve fitted rib knit sweater (upper body knitwear). Highly seasonal: peak fall/winter (cold weather), trough summer. Current date 2019/12/30 (Mon post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week). World knowledge: Post-Christmas lull after holiday surge; winter demand persists through Jan/Feb (cold N. Hemisphere), but sales taper post-gifting season; potential clearance/returns boost but overall decline from Dec peaks expected.\n(b) Demand regime: Holiday surge confirmed P42-46 volatile avg91 (168/65/46/85/93), +65% prior fall plateau. Recent P43-46 avg72 (excl. Thanksgiving outlier 168). Forecast P47: 60-90, moderate winter post-holiday; stable high expected Jan but monitor for spring decline (historical Feb avg~80 dropping to spring lows).\n(c) Lead time: Recent LT=2 reliable (e.g., P43\u2192P45, P45\u2192?P47 expected; P44 possibly LT3 P47). Ghosts stable ~1200 lost (no new losses recent). No new overdues: P44(250,P44\u2192P47 LT3?), P45(250,P45\u2192P47 LT2), P46(300\u2192P48 LT2) expected soon.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 853 (covers ~10 periods at 80/demand). In-transit 2000 (ghosts~1200 + real~800 incoming P47-P48). Post-P47 stock ~853 + arrivals(~500) - demand(~80) = ~1273 end-P47, plus more pipeline; extreme buffer (total ~2800 covers 30+ periods).\n(e) Final order logic: Massive stockpile vs. moderate post-holiday forecast; prioritize minimizing holding costs ($1/unit/period) over low stockout risk. Order 0; pipeline covers winter fully.",
