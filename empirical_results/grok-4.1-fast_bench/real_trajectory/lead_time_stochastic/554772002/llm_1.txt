Minimal holiday gift spike expected (not festive/specialty item); winter suppresses lightweight apparel demand. (b) Demand regime: Late fall/early winter drop sustained P35-42 avg~21 (7-33, P42=33 +65% vs P35-41~18 but single point, not 3p sustained rebound); aligns with seasonal suppression for T-shirts vs historical Jan~70-80/spring~90/summer~100. No confirmed holiday uptick yet. Forecast ~25-40/period near-term, buffer for modest Dec lift. (c) LT variability sustained 1-3 (recent: P41 LT2 P39\u219241, P39 LT3 P36\u219239, P38 LT1 P37\u219238); sporadic losses ~30% recent (P42=0 confirms ongoing ghosts, no new confirms); promised LT=2 unreliable. (d) Inventory: On-hand=199 (~8-10p at ~25dmd, high vs low regime); in-transit=1230 dominated by ghosts (~95% per prior, dry streaks P40/P42=0 post sporadic P38-39/P41); effective pipeline low/reliable arrivals ~50-100 sporadic. Total buffer covers 50+p even at ghosts. (e) Order 0: High on-hand + ghost-heavy pipeline covers low winter dmd + potential mild holiday (~30-50); minimize new orders/holding ($1/u/p) near end (P43/47), prioritize sales over restock given unreliability/losses.",

No new LT evidence; P43 arrive=0 extends dry (P40-43=0, 4p despite 1230 in-transit). Recent orders P40-43=0 so no new pipeline risk.

Post-P43: ample buffer despite losses.
