No major seasonal peak/drop for jeans. (b) Historical demand (weekly Mondays): 101 (Jan7), 101(14), 117(21), 123(28), 157(Feb4). Stable low ~101 first 2wks, then rising (avg last 3: 132, +28% vs early). Trend up, possibly pre-Valentine or seasonal; forecast Period 1 ~140-160 (extending recent). (c) No game history/concludes yet; promised lead time 2 (order P1 arrives during P3 arrival, visible P3 conclude at P4 start). No in-transit, no inference possible. (d) On-hand 0, in-transit 0: full stockout expected P1 & P2 (demand after decision, no arrivals). Pipeline empty. (e) Long horizon (47 periods), profit=holding=1 so minimize excess but avoid chronic stockouts (lost profit). Order for P3 coverage: ~160 (recent high + Valentine fade).
