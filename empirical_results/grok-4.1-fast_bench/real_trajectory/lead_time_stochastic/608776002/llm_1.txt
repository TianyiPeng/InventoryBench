(b) Demand regime: Holiday peak sustained/accelerating (P33-42 avg~380, P40-42 spike to 504/682 Thanksgiving, P43-45 post-dip build-up 280/299/420 avg333 +50% last period vs P44, rising trend into Christmas confirmed by calendar). Forecast P46: 600-800 (extrapolate 420+ holiday multiplier ~1.5-2x recent avg, conservative vs historical Jan~220). (c) Lead time: Confirmed variable 1-3 periods (recent: P45 arrivals P42 LT3/P43 LT2); massive ghost/lost pattern sustained (>20p, 3800u in-transit unreliable - many overdue like P44 850 exp P46 LT2 but pattern-miss likely). No new LT confirms in P45. (d) Inventory & pipeline: OH=1251 covers P46 forecast (600-800 \u2192 ending ~450-650, holding risk but service); in-transit 3800 ghost-heavy (partial arrivals sporadic e.g. P45 550+750=1300 but priors missed), unreliable for coverage; total pipeline fragile vs peaks. (e) Order logic: Ramp to 1100 (match P45, cover 2-3 future periods post-Christmas demand ~400-600 avg x (LT+1=4p buffer) minus unreliable transit/OH drawdown; balance stockouts ($1p lost) vs holding ($1/period) - high due to holiday uncertainty/ghost risk, position for Jan recovery.",

No major events immediate, but steady winter demand ahead. (b) Demand regime: sustained high winter/holiday peak P43-46 avg344 (280,299,420,380 + post-Thanksgiving acceleration); forecast P47 post-peak moderation to ~300 (consistent w/ historical post-holiday drop to Jan levels ~220-250), stabilizing ~250 next 3p. No new regime shift (prior Christmas acceleration covers). (c) LT variable 1-3 confirmed historically (e.g. P42 LT3 P45, P43 LT2 P45); lost/ghost shipments critically sustained (>20p, no P46 arrivals despite priors); prolonged absences signal don't rely on pipeline.
