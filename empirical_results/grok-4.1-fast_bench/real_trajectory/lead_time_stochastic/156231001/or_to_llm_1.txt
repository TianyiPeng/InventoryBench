{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: From P45 conclude (visible now), recent arrivals confirm LT variability 1-3 periods (e.g., P42 order arrived P45 LT=3; P43 order P45 LT=2); lost shipment pattern persists for older orders but recent pipeline (P42/P43) delivered fully (800 units total), suggesting some reliability for newer orders. Inventory position: On-hand=515 covers ~1 period of peak demand; in-transit=3218 is inflated due to historical losses but recent successes indicate not all lost; total pipeline + on-hand ~3733 units covers 7-9 periods at ~400-500 demand/period. Demand analysis: Winter/Christmas surge sustained high (P42=461, P44=367, P45=468; recent avg ~400); P46 date 2019/12/23 (Christmas Eve) likely peaks demand for women's tights/socks due to holidays/cold weather - forecast ~450-550 using recent highs + seasonal uplift. OR recommendation: 0 units (uses promised LT=2, historical demand; ignores losses/variability/seasonality) - reasonable baseline given high inventory, but we validate as position covers (L+1=3-4 periods) demand even with risks.

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: LT variability 1-3 periods confirmed from recent concludes (e.g., P42 LT3 in P45, P43 LT2 in P45, P40 LT3/P41 LT2 in P43); P46 conclude arrived=0 signals continued delays/losses for expected orders (e.g., P44 ordered=0 no impact, but priors/pattern persists). Promised LT=2 unreliable. Inventory analysis: On-hand=65 critically low (covers <1 period at recent ~400 demand); in-transit=3218 massively bloated by sustained lost shipments (historical unresolved overdues like P34/P36 etc., pattern since P1, no recent full recoveries). Demand analysis: Winter/Christmas surge sustained into late Dec - P44=367, P45=468, P46=450 (avg 428, +35% vs P36-P43 winter avg ~330); product is women's matt tights (20 denier, winter-appropriate for cold UK Dec/Jan weather); P47=2019/12/30 (New Year's week) likely sustains high demand post-Christmas peak due to ongoing holiday shopping/returns, cold season wear (no sharp drop signal yet).
