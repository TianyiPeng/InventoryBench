======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: No arrivals since Period 36 (latest confirmed LT=1/3/2 mixed historically), in-transit 1143 confirmed as cumulative lost shipments (per Period 39 insight, no arrivals P37-P46), effective pipeline=0; all recent orders lost matching pattern, ignore promised LT=2. Inventory position: On-hand=154 (from P46 ending), covers ~6 periods at recent demand rate; no expected inflows. Demand analysis: Sustained winter lows for jeans post-Thanksgiving/Christmas - P43-P46 demands=20,29,26,27 (avg=25.5, -56% vs P39-P42 avg57 per insight), P46=27 into Christmas week confirms no holiday uptick, late Dec (12/30) post-Christmas likely continued low (~25) absent resurgence signals. OR recommendation: 0 units, using historical data/promised LT but aligns with reality (high on-hand, low demand, unseen losses). Strategy: Follow OR at 0 - preserve on-hand buffer against low demand, avoid unnecessary orders prone to loss/holding costs; (L+1)=3 periods coverage ample with 154>>75 expected demand.",
