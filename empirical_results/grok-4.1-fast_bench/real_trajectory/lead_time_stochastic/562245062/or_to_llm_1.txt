Persistent lost shipment pattern per carry-over (in-transit bloat 1160 >> expected ~500-600 from recent orders like P44=150, P45=250 + residuals), meaning effective pipeline unreliable/lower than shown. Inventory: On-hand 409 sufficient for 3-5 periods at recent avg ~80-100 but vulnerable to holiday surge; post-P45 arrivals not yet visible but IT bloat suggests potential inflows. Demand analysis: Date 2019/12/23 (Christmas week, Mon before Christmas Eve) - expect major surge for women's skinny jeans as gifts/party wear, similar to P42=327 Thanksgiving/BF peak and carry-over 'Christmas peak expectation into Dec'; recent P44=54/P45=64 post-BF lull (2 periods) likely temporary ramp-up, breaking into high regime (prior P27-P37 avg 110, P42-43 avg 230). OR recommends 0 (base-stock met by perceived pipeline using promised LT=2/all-history mean ~70-80), but ignores lost shipments, LT drift to 2-3, and seasonal Christmas spike - uncapped OR likely lowballs safety stock for volatility. Strategy: Override OR 0 with 200 units to cover ~2-3 period surge (exp demand 150-250/period x (3+1)=800-1200 total need, buffer against lost IT; on-hand+order covers current + LT while minimizing excess holding vs profit incentive ($4 vs $1).
