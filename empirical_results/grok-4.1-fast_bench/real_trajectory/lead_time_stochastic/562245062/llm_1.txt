Lost pattern sustained (high in-transit accumulation, no new arrivals P44 yet visible next). P42 order(80) expected P44-45, P43(250) P45-46; prolonged no-arrivals signal losses but recent deliveries occurring.\n(d) Inventory: On-hand=77 (low, covers <1 period high demand). In-transit=1325 (huge ~5-8 periods coverage if arrives, but unreliable losses; recent P43 arrivals +210 boosted to 77 end).\n(e) Order logic: High holiday risk (stockouts P42/44+ costly lost sales $4p vs $1 hold). Order 250 to mirror P43 (post-spike), cover P46-47 peaks + pipeline gaps/losses; balances excess hold (pipeline ample if delivers) vs service. Conservative vs 300+ peak but proactive for Dec9 Christmas surge.",
