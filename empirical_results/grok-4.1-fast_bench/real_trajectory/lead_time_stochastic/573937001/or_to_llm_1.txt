Historical initial ~53 avg, recent low regimes ended, holiday spike over - forecast ~40-50/period near-term, no sustained uptick. OR rec=0 (uses promised LT=2, full history mean~54, high pipeline caps order); aligns perfectly - ample coverage (OH 176 + expected partial in-transit >10 periods demand), profit=holding=1 implies low safety stock, ordering adds holding risk amid demand normalization.
