(b) Demand regimes: Long-term upward P26-39 avg53 (+72% vs prior low30); holiday spike P42-43 (+200-400% vs avg53) with volatility (P44=51 dip); forecast P45 ~150-250 given Christmas proximity (avg recent holiday 171, adjust + for peak). Volatile low pre-holiday insufficient to break upward/holiday pattern. (c) Lead time: Variable 1-3 periods confirmed (e.g., P44 arrive=0; recent P43: LT3/2; P40 LT3); losses sustained (history 8+ orders lost, dry streaks); no new arrivals P44, in-transit 1400u (incl P44=150, P43=200 overdue LT=1/2)\u2014expect sporadic partial arrivals, but pipeline unreliable (assume 50% loss rate). No lost confirmation yet for latest. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout P44, sold=0 vs demand51); in-transit=1400 massive but delayed/loss-prone (covers 5-10 periods demand if all arrive, but expect delays/losses erode to ~700u effective). Pipeline lags: P43/44 orders likely arrive P45-46 (LT1-3). (e) Order logic: Near end (P45/47), prioritize service vs holding (profit=holding=1, low endgame penalty); forecast 200u P45 demand (holiday-adjusted); order 200u to buffer stockout risk (recent pattern: P42/44 OOS), cover (L+1)=3 periods (~600u total need), offset partial pipeline arrivals/losses\u2014balances sales upside vs excess hold (pipeline glut risk low due losses).",
