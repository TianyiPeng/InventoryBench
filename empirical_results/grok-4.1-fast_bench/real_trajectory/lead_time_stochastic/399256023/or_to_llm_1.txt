{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LTs mixed at 2-3 periods (e.g., P45: P42 LT3, P43 LT2; P43: P41 LT2; P41: P39 LT2), with sustained lost shipment pattern (no broad recovery, in-transit 1913 matches accumulation of known losses per carry-over). No new arrivals in P46, consistent. Inventory analysis: On-hand 664 extremely high vs recent demand avg ~35 (P40-P46: 31,33,40,60? Wait P42=60 but P40=31,P41=33,P43=40,P44=32,P45=35,P46=30 \u2192 avg ~37 over 7 periods); covers ~18+ periods even at higher past rates. In-transit 1913 effectively lost (no arrivals P36-P46 except sporadic, pattern sustained). Demand analysis: Low sustained per carry-over (P36-P45 avg45 over10 periods), continuing P46=30; date 2019/12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's eve, low jeans demand expected (holiday shopping peak passed, winter steady but no surge for denim trousers). OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history (ignores losses, recent low regime); aligns perfectly as base-stock massively exceeded by on-hand + sporadic pipeline. Strategy: Order 0 to avoid adding to holding costs ($1/unit/period on already excessive stock); no need to override OR.",
