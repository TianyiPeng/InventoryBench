Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), first decision with no prior conclude messages or in-transit orders. Historical demands (5 samples: mean ~103, std ~11) stable for everyday women's leggings; no seasonal events imminent (post-Chinese New Year, pre-Valentine's but basics not holiday-driven). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Defaults appropriate: backend uses L=2 (promised), mu_hat=3*mean_hist, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*std_hist, balancing service vs holding without evidence of shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18, Presidents' Day). P1 demand=125 exceeds historical mean ~103 (samples:113,101,106,85,112), possible Valentine's (2/14) or seasonal effect for winter leggings, but single period not sustained changepoint (need 3+). No concluded arrivals; P1 order=123 in-transit, expected arrive P3 if L=2 (visible P4). On-hand=0, pipeline=123 partially covers ~3 periods demand (~310). Defaults use promised L=2, mu_hat=3*103.4~310, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*10~17; backend base_stock~328 covers expected w/ q=0.8 service, orders to replenish pipeline gap while capping overstock risk. No overdue shipments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), late February, winter season for leggings (everyday basics, likely steady but recent demand uptick). Historical demand avg ~103 (std~11), but game P1 demand=125 (+21%), P2=199 (+59% from P1), indicating possible upward shift (no clear calendar event, perhaps seasonal or trend). No arrivals yet normal for promised LT=2 (P1 order arrives during P3, visible in P4 conclude). On-hand=0, in-transit=253 (P1=123+P2=130), stockouts in P1/P2 total lost sales 125+199=324. No observed LTs, no overdue/losses confirmed. Use default L=2. recent_N N=2 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent higher mean/vol ((125+199)/2=162, sample std~52), so backend mu_hat=3*162=486, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*52~90, boosting base-stock to cover ~3 periods demand while q=4/(4+1)=0.8 favors service. Pipeline covers past but low for future spikes.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, womens long leggings (everyday basics, jersey). Steady winter demand expected, no major events. Historical prior demands (5 samples pre-P1): avg 103, low std~11. Recent P1-P3 demands: 125,199,140 (avg 155 +50%, std~39); clear regime shift upward post-P1 changepoint (3 periods evidence). On-hand=0, in-transit=502 (P1:123+P2:130+P3:249), no arrivals (P1 order overdue past promised L=2 arrival in P3). No confirmed lead times (no arrival messages). Set L default (promised 2). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=3 to capture elevated mean/volatility over (1+L) periods, boosting base_stock for service level vs prior under-forecast (q=0.8 implies z~0.84). Pipeline covers ~3 periods recent demand (~465), limits over-ordering amid holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-P3: avg 155 (P1-P3:125/199/140) vs prior 103 (+50%), higher volatility std~39 vs prior ~11; sustained 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Early March, women's long leggings (everyday basics, jersey; possible winter-spring transition but no major calendar events). Recent demand volatile: P1-4: 125/199/140/90 (mean 138.5, std ~45.5), confirming carry-over higher regime shift vs initial samples (mean ~103, low std ~11); P4 dip to 90 but included in recent for robustness. Inventory: on-hand 40 (low vs recent demand), in-transit 392 (P1:123 overdue/likely lost - expected P3 arrival for LT=2 not in P3/P4 concludes; P3:249 exp P5 LT=2; P4:20 exp P6). Only 1 observed LT=2 (P2 order). Set L explicit=3 to account for delays/missing shipments (P1 prolonged absence signals longer effective LT or loss, backend unaware); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 (N=4=max(4 regime length,3); changepoint P1 start higher/volatile demand sustained 4 periods). Higher L/mu/sigma boosts base_stock ~mu(1+3)+z*sigma sqrt(4) to cover ~4 periods demand (~554), compensate lost pipeline, ensure high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding despite high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (123 units) likely lost: expected arrival during P3 (LT=2), no conclude in P3 or P4 despite 3+ periods overdue; remains in-transit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18, early spring). Leggings demand dropped sharply post-P3: P4=90 (-36% vs P3), P5=56 (-38%), P4-5 avg=73 vs P1-3 avg=155 (-53%), likely seasonal decline as spring approaches reducing winter apparel need. No major events. LT confirmed=2 (only P2 order: arrived P4). P1 order=123 lost (expected P3 arrival, no conclude in P3-P5, 3+ periods overdue). P3 order=249 overdue (expected P5 arrival during P5, arrived=0; if LT=3 would arrive P6 but pattern suggests risk of loss like P1). Pipeline=591 overstated (likely -123 P1, potentially -249 P3 = effective ~219). On-hand=0, so vulnerable to demand. Recent low demand but prior high/volatility. To compensate backend's unawareness of losses (sees full 591 pipeline, would order 0 under default L=2 as base_stock~390<591), set explicit L=4 inflating (1+L) review period/target base_stock~(1+4)*mean_all_samples~564 + z*sigma~+65=~629>591, prompting order ~38 to cover true pipeline + buffer (L+1=5 periods low demand ~365). Defaults for mu_hat/sigma_hat use full history balancing recent drop with prior.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Late March, women's long leggings (winter basics), demand likely declining into spring but Easter (Apr 21) may boost soon. Recent P4-6 demand 90/56/99 avg 81.7 (std~22.7), drop from P1-3 avg154.7 (std~39); stockouts in P1-3/P5. On-hand 100 covers ~1pd; in-transit 437 bloated by lost/overdue: P1(123 lost per carryover), P3(249 overdue >2pd past LT2 expected P5), P4(20 overdue 1pd past P6), reliable only P6(45). Effective position ~145 low vs (L+1)~3pd@90=270 need. Default L=2. Explicit mu_hat=700 (~3pd@233 inflated from 82*3=246 to recover ~370 lost bloat over time), sigma_hat=150 (inflated vol for service amid uncertainty). Yields base~700+0.84*150=826 >537 pipeline \u2192 order~289 < cap~375; boosts service level (q=0.8) while limiting overstock, bridges backend's ignorance of losses/delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-P3 to lower mean: P4-6 avg 81.7 (std 22.7) vs P1-3 154.7 (std 39.1), -47% drop, sustained 3 periods; Lost shipment pattern sustained: P3(249u) overdue >2 periods past promised LT=2 (no P5/P6 arrival), P4(20u) overdue 1 period past LT=2 (no P6); total suspected lost bloat ~392u; Lead time variability: observed LT=2 (P2->P4), LT=1 (P5->P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1): Early spring; leggings (women's everyday basics) demand likely moderating post-winter, approaching Easter (4/21) but minimal impact expected. Recent demands: P4=90, P5=56 (low), P6=99, P7=112 (uptick, avg P4-7~89 but volatile). On-hand=0, in-transit=727 includes ~392u suspected lost (P1:123 overdue since P3, P3:249 overdue since P5, P4:20 overdue since P6; confirmed no concludes). Actual expected pipeline: P6:45 (due P8 LT=2), P7:290 (P9), total ~335u. No new arrivals in P7 conclude. Observed LTs: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6); variability noted but use default L=2 (promised). To counter lost bloat misleading backend (pipeline overstated, risking order=0), use default mu_hat~(1+2)*111.5 all-samples mean=~335 (balances historical high/avg vs recent low regime); explicit sigma_hat=540 inflates safety stock by ~392u equiv (delta_sigma~466=392/0.84, atop default ~73), yielding bs~335+0.84*540~790>727 for modest order~60u. This boosts service level against pipeline uncertainty/lost risk without overstocking (cap ample), hedging holding costs while enabling sales recovery.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring leggings (everyday basics); no major holidays imminent (Easter 4/21 may mildly boost apparel). Recent demand changepoint post-P5: P6-8 avg 113 (99/112/128, std~14.5) vs P4-5 avg 73 (+54% uptick, sustained 3 periods, reverting toward historical ~118 mean). Pipeline bloated at 454u including lost/severely overdue P1(123u, 6+ periods past LT2), P3(249u, 4+ past), P4(20u, 3+ past); effective reliable pipeline low (~62u from P8). On-hand 207 covers ~1.8 recent periods' demand. Use recent_N=4 for L (observed LTs:2,1,2,1 avg1.5< promised2, reduces backend's assumed pipeline lag/cap denominator). recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture new higher/lower-vol regime, scaling accurate (1+L)~2.5x113=282.5 mean demand over review+LT; higher base_stock counters lost bloat (backend subtracts phantom pipeline, this boosts target); low recent sigma tempers z but prioritizes mean shift for service.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-P5: P6-8 avg 113 (std~14.5) vs P4-5 avg 73 (+54%), sustained 3 periods; Lost shipment pattern sustained: P4(20u) overdue 3+ periods past LT=2 (no P6-P8 arr), total suspected lost bloat 392u

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15, mid-spring; leggings everyday basics, no major events imminent like Easter 4/21). Demand history: P1-3 high avg154.7 std39; P4-5 low avg73; post-P5 regime P6-9: 99/112/128/89 avg107 std17, sustained 4 periods confirming ~110 mean shift (+54% vs P4-5), volatility moderate. On-hand 118 (covers ~1 period), in-transit 454=392 lost bloat (P1:123/P3:249/P4:20 overdue 4+ periods past LT=2, no concludes; pattern sustained per carry-over) +62 P8 order (no P9 arrive confirms LT\u22601, likely=2 arriving P10). Effective position ~118+62=180 vs true base~(1+2)*107 +0.84*sqrt(3)*17 \u2248321+25=346 (understocked). Bloat causes backend pipeline overstatement, zero orders. Offset by explicit mu_hat=3*107 +392=713 (true demand over 3 periods + bloat), yielding base~713+25=738 >>572 pipeline, order~166 to refill true need.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29), late spring; leggings (womens basics) demand steady, no major events upcoming. On-hand=0 (stockout risk), in-transit=633 bloated by sustained ~392 lost units (P1:123 overdue since P3, P3:249 overdue since P5, P4:20 overdue since P6; confirmed no arrivals after 6+ periods past promised LT=2). Recent demand regime post-P5 changepoint (P4-5 avg~73 low): P6-11 (99,112,128,89,87,115) avg=105, std=16.1, sustained 6 periods, no new shift (P9-11 avg97 close). Observed LTs (5): 2,1,2,1,2 avg1.6/mixed 1-2 recently, but default L=2 conservative for coverage. mu_hat explicit=(1+2)*105 +392 lost_bloat=707 inflates base_stock by 392, yielding order=true_base - true_pipeline (bridges lost orders gap). sigma_hat recent_6 captures current regime low vol. Ensures high service (q=0.8) despite bloat/0 on-hand, limits holding via backend z/capping.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6): Early May, spring weather likely reducing leggings demand (everyday basics, lower body garment); recent P12 stockout (demand=97, sold=0, on-hand=0). In-transit=731 bloated by suspected permanent losses ~558u [prior carry-over 392u (P1=123, P3=249, P4=20) + new P10=166 overdue >1pd past promised LT=2 (no arrival P12 conclude)] + reliable recent P11=75 + P12=98=173u. Recent demand stable low-vol regime post-P5 shift (carry-over confirmed): P6-12 n=7 avg~104 std~15 (changelpoint evidence: sustained 7pd). Target true IP~410 (covers 3pd@104=312 + generous safety~100 for LT/supply risk). Desired order=410-173=237. Set params for backend base~972 (order 972-731=241); cap~342>241. Uses L=default (promised 2, despite observed recent LT avg1.67/3 obs); mu_hat=explicit 950 (inflates for bloat, equiv ~317pd inflated mean); sigma_hat=recent_N N=7 (low vol regime len=7, sqrt(3)*15~26 z\u03c3~22). Balances high service vs holding by low \u03c3, large \u03bc to force order despite bloat.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern sustained/worsened: P10(166u) overdue (no P12 arrival, 1+ period past promised LT=2); total suspected lost bloat ~558u (392 prior +166); Demand regime shift post-P8: P9-12 avg 97 (std~13) vs P6-8 avg 113 (std~15), -14% drop sustained 4 periods (spring seasonal for leggings?).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13, mid-May spring/summer transition): Leggings demand declining seasonally (warmer weather reduces need), recent P9-13 demands [89,87,115,97,79] avg=93.4 (std=13.7), confirming post-P8 regime shift to lower mean ~97 (now sustained 5 periods, -14% from P6-8). Pipeline=897 bloated by ~558u suspected lost (P1:123, P3:249, P4:20, P10:166 overdue 2+ periods past LT=2, per carry-over); true pipeline ~339u (P12:98 expected P14 LT=2, P13:241 expected P15) covers ~3.5 periods demand. Recent LTs favor 2 (last 3 observed:2,2,2). Default L=2; recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat targets (1+2)*93.4=280 mean + ~20 safety (~sqrt(3)*13.7*0.84) = base~300 <<897 pipeline \u2192 order=0, prevents overordering amid ghosts (OR unaware), minimizes holding on non-arriving inventory while true pipeline suffices, high service q=0.8.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20, late spring/early summer); leggings demand stable in recent regime post-P8 (P9-14: demands 89,87,115,97,79,104; avg 95.2, std~13; sustained 6 periods, no new changepoint vs prior avg97/-14% drop, minor spring seasonal softening but P14 rebound to 104 confirms stability around 95-100, consistent with initial samples ~103). On-hand=0 (stockout risk), in-transit=799 (dead bloat ~558u from confirmed lost P1:123/P3:249/P4:20/P10:166 + reliable pending P13:241). Recent LT stable at 2 (last 4 observes: P8->P10/P11->P13/P12->P14 all LT=2; prior variability LT1/2). To counter dead bloat (backend subtracts full 799 pipeline, underordering), inflate mu_hat explicitly to ~dead 558 + (1+2)*95= ~558+285=843, set 900 for buffer; default L=2 (matches recent/promised); sigma recent_N=6 captures current low volatility regime (std13 vs early ~39). Ensures base_stock >>799 to trigger orders ~100/period (cap~100), rebuilding real coverage while balancing hold cost; cap limits overorder.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, Memorial Day holiday - potential apparel demand spike). Recent demand P13-15: 79/104/145 avg109 std~33 (+12% and higher vol vs P9-12 avg97 std~13). On-hand 0 (stockout risk), in-transit 919 bloated ~800u lost (P1:123/P3:249/P4:20/P10:166 overdue 6p/P13:241 overdue post-P15 arr=0; reliable recent: P15:120 pending). Recent LT confirmed 2 (P11->13, P12->14). Offset lost bloat for backend (unaware): explicit mu_hat=1200 (~3*110 +800 bloat) targets base_stock~1280 >919 pipeline, ordering ~360 to cover 3p demand+safety vs holding cost. L default (promised/recent=2). sigma_hat explicit 80 reflects realized vol (recent std20-33 >> initial11), adds ~67 safety.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern worsened: P13(241u) overdue 2+ periods past LT=2 (no P15 arrival); P10(166u) overdue 6 periods; total suspected lost bloat ~800u (+241); Demand regime shift post-P12: P13-15 avg109 std33 vs P9-12 avg97 std13 (+12%, higher vol sustained 3 periods).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=1268 (suspected ~799u lost bloat P1:123/P3:249/P4:20/P10:166/P13:241 overdue 7+/4+/3+/2+/3+ periods resp.; real pipeline ~469u P15:120 exp P17/P16:349 exp P18).

But sustained lost pattern risks P15/P16 lost \u2192 stockouts P17/P18; hedge by explicit mu_hat=1480 (normal 327 + bloat 799 + hedge ~354/3 periods@118), yields base~1480+39~1519-1268~251 order (<<cap~1480/3 +1.64*27~493+44=537) to rebuild buffer proactively. L default (promised=2; recent observed LT=2 stable, no changepoint). Sigma recent_N N=4 (regime length=4 \u2192 max(min(4,20),3)=4; matches vol shift evidence).

High on-hand=406 covers multiple periods; in-transit=1051 bloated by sustained lost shipments (e.g., P10=166 overdue 8+ periods past LT=2, P13=241 overdue 3+ periods, prior losses ~800u total suspected lost). Recent LT observations (last 5: P17-P15 LT2, P17-P16 LT1, P14-P12 LT2, P13-P11 LT2, P10-P8 LT2; avg~1.8). No new sustained regime shift (P17 low not yet 3+ periods). Use recent_N N=5 for L (captures LT=1-2 variability), mu_hat (3*100=300 low demand outlook), sigma_hat (sqrt(3)*31~54 reflects vol) to set conservative base_stock ~300 + 0.84*54~345; with pipeline=1457 >> base, order~0 minimizing holding on bloat while covering ~100 demand/period.

On-hand 320 (high, covers 3+ periods), in-transit 1051 bloated ~800u lost per carry-over + P17 252 pending (LT=2 expected arrive during P19). Position ~1371. Historical demand mean~106.8 (P1-18), recent6~97.7. Lost shipment pattern sustained (no new losses confirmed yet). Observed LT recent: mostly 2 (P15->17 LT2, P12->14 LT2, etc.), avg~1.6-1.8 but irrelevant vs losses. To counter phantom pipeline bloat (backend unaware), explicit L=12 inflates base_stock: default mu_hat=(13)*106.8~1388, sigma_hat=sqrt(13)*std_all~sqrt13*~35~130 z*~110, base~1500>1371 allowing deficit~130 order (capped ~107+1.645*35~156 ok).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24), early summer; leggings (women's everyday basics) likely facing seasonal demand drop due to heat, recent P17-19 avg90 confirming shift from prior ~109. Pipeline: on-hand 199 + in-transit 1150 = 1349; lost bloat sustained at 1051u (P1:123, P3:249, P4:20, P10:166, P13:241, P17:252 confirmed overdue past P19 conclude); good position ~298u (199 on-hand + P19:99 pending). Reconcile overdue shipments per carry-over + new P17 lost. Chgpoint: demand post-P12 regime P13-19 avg101 std25.5 (N=7 sustained). L=calculate (9 observed LTs avg1.67: six 2s, three 1s). Normal mu_hat=(1+1.67)*101\u2248269, sigma_hat=\u221a2.67*25.5\u224842. Inflate mu_hat by lost bloat to 1320 for effective base_or=1320+0.84*42\u22481355 >1349, yielding small initial order; good arrivals reduce in-transit (lost static), widening gap for larger future orders up to inflated cap~ mu_hat/(1+L)\u2248495 + safety, balancing high service vs holding by virtually offsetting phantom bloat.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern worsened: P17(252u) confirmed lost (overdue 3+ periods past promised LT=2, no P19 arrival); total suspected lost bloat 1051u (prior ~800 +252); Demand regime shift post-P16: P17-19 avg90 std~24 vs P13-16 avg109 std~24 (-17% drop), sustained 3 periods + early summer seasonal for leggings.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01): Early July summer, leggings demand low/declining seasonally (hot weather reduces wear). Recent P16-20 demands: 109/63/86/121/49, avg=85.6 std=30.2 (volatile but downward trend from prior regimes ~109 avg). On-hand=150, total in-transit=1157 (suspected lost bloat~1051u from P1/3/4/10/13/17 overdue; real pipeline~106u from P19=99/P20=7). Reconcile: P17(252u) lost confirmed (overdue past P19/P20); P19(99u) pending P21 arrival. Natural forecast L=2 (observed recent avg~2), mu_d=85.6 sigma_d=30.2 \u2192 mu_hat=257 sigma_hat=52 (base_stock~301). Offset bloat: explicit mu_hat=1308 (=257+1051), sigma_hat=52 \u2192 backend base_stock~1352, order~45 (=301 - real_pos~256), targets real position~301 (covers 3+ periods demand+safety). Cap~485>45. Balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding by compensating ghosts precisely, orders conservatively given low summer demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8, early summer): Leggings demand low due to seasonal summer shift, recent P17-21 regime sustained 5 periods avg 80.2 (std 27.3) vs prior P13-16 ~109, confirmed changepoint post-P16 with evidence of continued decline/drop (-26% mean). On-hand 68 low vs ~80 demand, true position ~219 after subtracting ~1051 suspected lost bloat (per carry-over, in-transit 1202 overstated). No new arrivals P21. Reconcile: overdue P19(99u) emerging but 1 period past LT=2; pattern sustained. Target true base_stock ~(1+2)*80.2 + 0.84*sqrt(3)*27.3 \u2248241 + 40 = 281 (covers 3 periods low demand + safety). Compensate phantom pipeline by inflating mu_hat explicit=1051 lost + 241 true_mu=1292, yielding backend base ~1292 + 40 = 1332, order ~1332-1270=62 to reach true target while balancing service vs holding (q=0.8 moderate).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15 mid-summer): Leggings demand seasonally low, recent regime shift post-P19 confirmed P20-22 avg 66 (49/82/66, std~17) vs P17-19 90 (-27% drop sustained 3p); expect continued low ~60-80/period. Critically low OH=9 vs dmd~70 risks stockout. IT=1257 bloated by sustained lost shipments (~1150u lost per carry-over + history reconciliation: P1=123, P3=249, P4=20, P10=166, P13=241, P17=252, P19=99 etc. no concludes ever, overdue >>2p). Pipeline pos=1266. Hist mean dmd~102 (sum2241/22p). To force backend order>0 despite bloat (base >1266), explicit L=13 inflates default mu_hat=(1+13)*102~1426 + z*default_sigma_hat (sqrt14*std_all~40? +~120 margin) >1266; order~160 min cap~110 (1426/14~102 +1.645*sigma/sqrt14~20). Builds real inv for sales/upcoming seasons while default params leverage hist for balance. LT recent observed avg~1.8 (last5:2,2,1,2,2) but irrelevant vs lost bloat. Recent_N not used as default scales better here.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-P19: P20-22 avg66 std~17 vs P17-19 avg90 std~24 (-27% drop), sustained 3 periods; mid-summer seasonal low for leggings confirmed. Lost shipment pattern worsened: P19(99u) confirmed lost (overdue 3+ periods past promised LT=2, no P21/P22 arrival); total suspected lost bloat ~1150u (+99).

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29): Late summer, leggings demand low due to seasonal warmth (mid-summer low confirmed in carry-over). Recent demand P20-24: 49,82,66,80,71; avg=69.6, sample std=13.16 (regime sustained 5+ periods post-P19, no new changepoint).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5, early August): continuing mid-summer seasonal low for women's long leggings, recent P20-25 demand avg 69 (49,82,66,80,71,66), std~12 low vol, P23-25 avg72 std~7 confirming sustained low ~70/period no new shift. On-hand=0, stockouts P24-25 (36+66=102 lost sales). In-transit=1380 bloated w/ suspected lost ~1300u (prior 1150u + P23 153 overdue past promised LT=2, no P25 arr; actual pipeline low ~230u recent P23-25 orders, likely partial losses). OR backend unaware of losses sees high pipeline, orders 0 w/ default/recent params (e.g. recent_6 mu_hat~207<<1380). Inflate explicit mu_hat=1500, sigma_hat=100 over L=2 (demand 3pd ~210 + safety) to target base_stock~1584 (mu+z*sigma w/ z~0.84), order~204 = 1380 ghosts + (210-~80 actual pipe), covers upcoming w/o massive overorder; cap~1500/3 +1.645*100/1.73~500+95=595>204 ok. Addresses losses by forcing compensatory order vs stockout cost ($4>holding$1).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern worsened: P23(153u) overdue 1+ period past promised LT=2 (no P25 arrival); total suspected lost bloat ~1303u (+153); Summer demand low sustained into early Aug: P20-25 avg69 std12 (6 periods, -24% vs spring avg90).

On-hand 79 covers ~1 period demand; in-transit 1396 bloated, aligns with ~1300u+ suspected lost (e.g., P24 ord41 overdue past P27 no-arrival). Recent LTs: last 5 observations avg 2.0 (P27:2, P26:3, P23:2/1, P22:2), variability incl LT=3. Use recent_5 for L to reflect avg actual LT~2; recent_8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to match low demand regime (backend computes (1+L)*65.5, sqrt(1+L)*12.1), lowering base_stock vs all-data to curb overordering/holding amid losses & low sales, balancing service vs cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26, late summer): Leggings demand remains in low summer regime, P20-28 avg 63.8 (std~12.4, 9 periods), further drop post-P25 P26-28 avg53.3 (std~4, -23% vs P20-25 avg69, sustained 3 periods). On-hand 29 low vs recent demand~50-60 (risk stockout P29), but in-transit 1396 bloated with suspected lost ~1550u (P1/3/4/10/13/17/19/24/26 orders unarrived despite overdue >promised LT=2). Recent LTs (last 5 obs: P20-22 LT2, P21-23 LT2, P22-23 LT1, P23-26 LT3, P25-27 LT2) avg 2.0. No imminent arrivals (P27/28 orders=0). Use recent_N N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime length=9 sustained low summer, changepoint post-P19 confirmed in carry-over) to set mu_hat~(1+2)*63.8=191.4, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*12.4~21.5; recent_N N=5 for L (recent avg=2 bridges variability/losses). Yields low base_stock~210 (z~0.84 for q=4/5) << pipeline 1425, triggers order~0 avoiding bloat/holding while recent low demand needs minimal coverage; adapts OR to ignore bloated lost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-P25: P26-28 avg53 std~4 vs P20-25 avg69 std~12 (-23% drop, lower vol sustained 3 periods); Lost shipment pattern worsened: P26(205u) overdue 1+ period past LT=2 (no P28 arrival), P24(41u) overdue 4+ periods; total suspected lost bloat ~1550u (+205 from prior ~1344).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2, Labor Day Monday, early fall); Long Leggings (women's basics) in sustained post-summer low demand regime post-P25 changepoint: P26-29 demands [58,52,50,49] avg 52.25 (std 4.0, -23% vs P20-25 avg69 std12), low vol sustained 4 periods confirmed by P29=49; potential seasonal rebound as fall approaches/cooler weather but no evidence yet. On-hand=0 (risk stockout), in-transit=1396 bloated by sustained lost shipments (~1550u prior est., overdue e.g. P24=41u >5pd past LT2, P26=205u >2pd past LT2, others); no new arrivals P28-29. Reconcile: lost pattern causes illusory high pipeline, backend underorders (recent P27-29 ord=0). Set L explicit=27 (effective LT inflated due to sustained missing shipments/delays like P23 LT3, to target base_stock ~(1+27)*52.25=1463 + z*sigma >1396 allowing ~60u order); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=4 (regime_length=4, N=max(min(4,20),3)=4) for current low mean/vol, backend scales to ~1463/21.3; cap~52+7=59u. Ensures positive capped order ~weekly demand to maintain high service (q=0.8) despite bloat, slowly replenishes coverage for (promised+1)=3pd while minimizing hold risk if late arrivals.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9): Early fall, leggings demand may uptick with cooling weather (historical Jan-Feb avg~103), but recent P26-30 demands [58,52,50,49,65] confirm sustained summer low regime post-P25 (avg 54.8 std~6.0, -23% vs P20-25 avg69, 5 periods). On-hand=0 after P30 stockout (demand=65); in-transit=1455 bloated w/ suspected losses (e.g., P26 205u overdue 3+ past LT=2, no P28-30 arr; prior bloat ~1550u). Recent LTs stable avg~2 (last 5 obs: P27 LT2, P26 LT3, P23 LT2/P21, P23 LT1/P22, P22 LT2/P20). Set recent_N=5 for L (avg LT=2), mu_hat (3*54.8\u2248164), sigma_hat (sqrt3*6\u224810.4): low targets counter bloat (OR orders min(base-low pipeline, cap)\u22480), recent data ensures service for low demand while high q=0.8 prioritizes sales vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern worsened: P26(205u) confirmed lost (overdue 3+ periods past LT=2, no P28-P30 arrival); total suspected lost bloat ~1455u (current in-transit matches); Demand low regime sustained: P26-30 avg54.8 std6.0 (5 periods, stable post-P25 drop).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=1554 bloated with ~1400+ suspected lost (carry-over ~1455u + P32:158 pending; confirmed no new arrivals for old overdue like P26:205, P24:41 etc.). Recent demand P23-32 avg63 std~22 confirms higher vol post-summer. Reconcile: reliable pipeline minimal (~158 P32 arr P34 LT2); ignore bloat for targeting.

Pipeline: OH=0, transit=1874; real_pipe=478 (P32:158 age=2 expected LT2 arrival P34; P33:320 age=1 possible LT1); bloat=1396 (stable vs prior 1455). No new lost shipments confirmed (no arrivals P33/P32 signaling new overdues).

Massive ghost pipeline bloat 1874u (suspected lost ~1600u+ incl. P32 158u overdue past LT=2 no P34 arr); on-hand=0 risks lost sales at ~105/wk. Reconcile: Recent arrivals sparse (last P32:59u), many overdue inflate pipe. Set L='calculate' (observed LT avg~1.8 across 15 arrives: mostly 1-2, one recent 3); mu_hat explicit=2200 targets base_stock~2200 + z*~20 \u22482220 >1874 pipe to enable ~350u order (desired 3*110 coverage + buffer) as real pipe depletes/ghosts ignored effectively; sigma_hat recent_N N=3 (std11 \u2192 sqrt(1+L)~20 low vol post-shift). Balances high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding by overcoming bloat for real inv replenishment ahead of fall demand growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-P31: P32-34 avg105 std11 vs P26-31 avg54 std8 (+93%), sustained 3 periods; fall seasonal increase for leggings confirmed (2019-10-07).

Overall historical mean~90 std~35. To counter permanent pipeline inflation from lost orders (backend under-orders as base<<bloat), inflate L explicit=23 (effective longer LT due to unreliable/delayed/lost shipments pattern; recent observed LTs avg~2.4 but losses imply need higher base_stock~(1+23)*94.5~2270 + z*118~2370>2062+cap~100). mu_hat recent_N=4 (changepoint post-P31, regime len=4>3 sustained, N=4) for fall-adjusted higher mean. sigma_hat recent_N=4 captures elevated recent vol.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28, late Oct, pre-Halloween/cooler fall weather for women's long leggings basics). Recent demand regime shift post-P34 confirmed: P35-37 demands 62/57/64 avg61 std~3.5 (low vol) vs P32-34 97/121/98 avg105 std~12 (-42% drop, sustained 3 periods; possible post-Sep normalization after brief fall uptick). On-hand 641 covers >10 periods at 61 demand; in-transit 1531 bloated by chronic losses (e.g., P36 order 135 overdue past LT=1, no P37 arr; prior suspected ~1874u adjusted to current 1531u total). P37 arr=0 as expected no LT=0. Use default L=2 (promised, recent obs avg~2.1 no sustained shift); recent_N N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target low demand/vol (mu_hat~(1+2)*61=183, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*3.5~6); yields low base_stock ~188 + z*6 << IP=2172, ensures order~0 to minimize new holding on already excess inv while high service q=0.8 covers regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-P34: P35-37 avg61 std3.5 vs P32-34 avg105 std12 (-42% drop, lower vol sustained 3 periods); Lost shipment pattern worsened: P36(135u) overdue 1+ period past LT=1 (no P37 arrival), contributing to sustained in-transit bloat ~1531u.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4): Early November, leggings demand potentially rising with colder weather/holidays, but recent regime post-P34 shift to low mean sustained 4 periods (P35-38 demands 62/57/64/61 avg=61 std~2.4, -42% vs P32-34 avg105 std12). On-hand 580 covers ~9+ periods at 61/demand; in-transit 1531 bloated with sustained lost shipments (e.g., P36 135u overdue 2+ past promised LT=2, no P38 arr; prior losses ~1400u). No recent arrivals P37-38. LT recent variability sustained (last 6 obs: LT=3,1,3,2,2,3 avg~2.33).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11): Pre-Thanksgiving (Nov28)/Black Friday (Nov29), potential holiday uptick for leggings (cold weather/everyday basics), but recent demand P35-39: 62/57/64/61/35 avg 55.8 (std~11.9), confirms sustained low regime post-P34 shift (5 periods, -42% vs P32-34 avg105, low vol). High on-hand 680 + in-transit 1396 (historical bloat ~1500u from losses). Recent arrivals ok: P36(135u) arrived P39 LT=3 (no new major overdues). Reconcile: pipeline >> needs. Set L default=2 (recent observed LT avg~2.2, variability noted); mu_hat recent_5=(3x55.8)~167 low mean; sigma_hat recent_5=sqrt(3)x11.9~21 low vol.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18), pre-Thanksgiving (Nov 28 ~1.5 periods away); women's long leggings (everyday basics) in sustained low demand regime post-P34 changepoint: P35-40 demands [62,57,64,61,35,60] avg=56.5 std\u224810.8 (6 periods, regime_length=6); no holiday spike yet despite fall/winter context. On-hand=620 (high holding cost exposure), in-transit=1396 bloated by chronic lost shipments (~1500u per carry-over). Recent LT evidence: LT=3 sustained in last 3 observations (P36 order->P39 LT=3, P33->P36 LT=3, P32->P35 LT=3), amid variability/losses; overdue shipments reconciled as losses bloat pipeline. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed delays/losses, ensuring coverage over longer horizon. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_6 to anchor on low recent regime (backend: mu=(1+3)*56.5=226, sigma=\u221a4*10.8\u224821.6); base_stock\u2248226 + 0.84*21.6\u2248244 << pipeline 2016, yields order\u22480 minimizing holding while conservatively covering potential near-term uptick.

Carry-over insight: Lead time shift to 3 periods sustained: last 3 observations LT=3 (P32->P35, P33->P36, P36->P39); Demand low regime extended P35-40 avg56.5 std10.8 (6 periods post-P34).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Late November, Black Friday (Nov 29) and Thanksgiving (Nov 28) week approaching; leggings demand likely to spike for holiday shopping/winter wear (historical early-year avg~103, fall P32-34 avg105), but current low regime sustained P35-41 avg53.9 std~12.1 (7 periods post-P34 drop, no upward changepoint evidence yet). On-hand 582 covers ~11 periods at 54 demand; in-transit 1396 bloated by sustained lost shipments (prior ~1531u, pattern unchanged). Recent LT observations: P39 LT3, P36 LT3/LT1, P35 LT3 (avg last 3 arrived ~2.67, sustained evidence for longer LT=3 per carry-over P32/33/36 orders). Set L explicit 3 to conservatively cover delays/losses (backend assumes promised 2, this bridges gap by extending protection horizon). mu_hat recent_N N=7 reflects sustained low regime ((1+3)*53.9~215.6); sigma_hat recent_N N=7 low vol sqrt(4)*12.1~24. Base_stock ~216 + 0.84*24 ~235 << pipeline~1978 ensures order~0, minimizes holding costs on excess inv while high service; monitors for holiday shift next periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16): Pre-Christmas week (Dec 25 approaching), leggings demand expected to spike due to holiday shopping/cold weather (similar to P42 Thanksgiving/Black Friday 208 demand, +300% vs prior low regime avg~55; early winter P1-3 avg155, hist samples avg103). Recent P43-44 low (40,43) post-spike dip but seasonal ramp-up proactive adjustment needed. Pipeline bloated: on-hand 291 covers ~2wks at 150/wk expected, in-transit 2435 (sustained lost bloat ~2400u+, no arrivals P40-44; P43 778 overdue LT=2 expected today but lost pattern, P44 261 pending). Lead time sustained shift to 3 (confirmed last obs P36->P39 LT3, P33->P36 LT3, P32->P35 LT3; no new arrivals contradict). No new overdue flags beyond pattern. Params: L explicit=3 uses observed sustained avg, overrides promised 2 for backend. mu_hat explicit=520=(1+3)*130 forecasts seasonal holiday/winter mean (blend hist103 + early155 + P42208 adj). sigma_hat recent_N=10 (post-P34 regime length~10, avg66.8 std~48; backend sqrt(4)*48~96 captures holiday vol).

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23, Christmas Eve week): leggings demand spikes expected due to winter/holiday season (prior spikes P42 Nov25 pre-Thanksgiving 208, P45 Dec16 181). On-hand 888 covers ~4-5 high-demand periods (888/180); in-transit 1657 bloated w/ chronic lost shipments (~1600u suspected lost per carry-over, effective pipeline ~888 + ~261 P44 order exp LT=2); no new overdue concludes. Demand changepoint post-P41: P42-45 avg118 std~89 (208/40/43/181) vs P35-41 avg~54 std~11 (+118% mean, vol x8), sustained 4 periods (regime_length=4 \u2192 N=4); LT recent 5 obs (P45:2, P39:3, P36:3/P33, P36:1/P35? outlier noted but incl, P35:3) avg~2.4 vs all~1.95, recent regime ~10p variability (N=5). recent_N N=4 mu/sigma captures holiday high mean/vol (mu~(1+2.4)*118~360, sigma~1.9*89~169, z~142, base~500 <<2545 pipe \u2192 order 0); high service q=0.8 preserved, prevents overstock post-holiday drop while covering spike w/ current on-hand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas/New Year's eve; leggings demand likely sustained high in winter/holiday extension (P46 demand=155 continues regime). On-hand=733 (down from P45 end=888 after 155 sold), covers ~6wks at recent avg; in-transit=1657 bloated w/ losts (e.g., P44 order=261 overdue: expected P46 arr LT=2 but P46 conclude arrived=0). No new arrivals P46. Recent LT obs variable (last ~5: incl. P45 LT=2, P39 LT=3, P36 LT=3/1, P35 LT=3; avg~2.4). Recent demand regime post-P41 sustained high P42-46 avg125 std~79 (208/40/43/181/155; +118% vs prior low, high vol holiday spikes). Use recent_N N=5 for L/mu_hat/sigma_hat: targets ~2.4 LT, mu~(1+2.4)*125~376, sigma~sqrt(3.4)*79~146; base_stock~376+0.84*146~500. IP=733+1657=2390>>base so orders~0 (good, avoids adding to bloat), but params ensure backend preps for sustained high demand/vol if/when ghosts 'clear'; balances service (cover winter spikes) vs holding (no overorder).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern worsened: P44(261u) overdue 1+ period past LT=2 (no P46 arrival); total suspected lost bloat sustained ~1657u (current in-transit); Demand high regime post-P41 extended P42-46 avg125 std~79 (+118% mean/high vol vs prior, sustained 5 periods winter holiday).
