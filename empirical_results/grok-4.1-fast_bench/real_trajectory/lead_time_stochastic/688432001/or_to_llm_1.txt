No new concludes in P45 indicate overdue orders, but in-transit 1270 likely includes many lost per pattern (total lost ~1400u+). Inventory position: On-hand 295 (post-P45: 332 start -37 demand=295 end) is very high, covers 7-10 periods even at historical avg ~100u or recent ~50u; total position 295+1270=1565 excessive vs needs.

Summer low/fall recovery/dip patterns per carry-over, BF spike not sustained into Christmas (low recent demands contradict pure calendar surge expectation). OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2 + all-history demand (ignores seasonality/losses/regimes), aligns with high inventory to minimize holding costs (H=P=$1).
