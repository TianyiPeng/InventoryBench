On-hand=339 covers expected 120-200 demand + buffer; in-transit=800 bloated by >510u cumulative losses (per carry-over) but recent reliable arrivals (P45:290u LT=2-3; P43:280u) ensure replenishment over LT~2-3 variability. LT inference from concludes: recent stable 1-3 (e.g., P42->P45 LT=3, P43->P45 LT=2); no new losses post-P42. OR recommends 0 using promised LT=2/historical demand, accurately reflecting high pipeline/on-hand vs base-stock (high inventory position caps order). Strategy: Follow OR 0 to minimize holding costs ($1/u/period) post-Christmas drop anticipated P47+ (12/30), as 339+effective pipeline covers 5-10+ periods at ~100u demand; override risk unneeded with ample coverage.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirms LT=2-3 (e.g., P42 order arrived P45 LT=3; P43 LT=2 in P45; P40 LT=3 in P43), with variability and losses persisting (cumulative >510u lost per P42 insight, in-transit 800 bloated). No new LT extremes in P46 conclude (arrived=0, as expected for recent orders). Inventory position: On-hand=262 (covers 3+ periods at recent ~80-100 demand), in-transit=800 (high but unreliable due to losses; expected near-term arrivals from P44=150 LT~3 arrive ~P47, P45=150 LT~2 arrive ~P47, but risks). Demand analysis: Holiday peak sustained P30-46 avg~95 (+280% summer low), driven by back-to-school/fall/Thanksgiving/BF/Christmas (dates align: P42 11/25 BF peak 142, P43 12/2 dip 43, ramp P44-46 77-111). P47 2019/12/30 post-Christmas/near NYE: expect sharp demand drop (jeans sales slow post-holiday gifting/returns/clearance; analogous to post-BF P43 -70%). Recent P46=77 (down from P45=111). OR rec=0 based on promised LT=2/historical demand, but aligns perfectly with high on-hand/pipeline vs. anticipated post-holiday decline.
