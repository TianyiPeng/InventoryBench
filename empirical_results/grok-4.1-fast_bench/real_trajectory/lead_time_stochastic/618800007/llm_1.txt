  "rationale": "(a) Product: Women's V-neck satin top with lace trim, skinny straps (blouse/vest top, everyday but party-appropriate).

Fashion tops relevant for holiday attire despite summer-ish design. (b) Demand: Recent P43-P45 avg8 (10,6,8), sustained low post-Thanksgiving drop (-50% vs P39-P42 avg19); overall trend softening from spring 110+ to fall 10-20 to late fall ~13-14 stabilization (per carry-over P38-P41), but P42 holiday +135% bump then revert. Christmas likely spikes to 30-60+. Forecast next 3p: 40(P46 holiday),30(P47),20(P48). (c) LT: Recent variability sustained 1-3p (e.g. P42 LT3 to P45, P43 LT2 to P45, prior P32 LT3). Promised 2. No confirmed new lost/overdue (P44 ord20 exp P46 LT2/P47 LT3; P45 ord20 exp P47/48; visible next). Lost pattern prior ~1215 units in-transit. (d) Inv/pipeline: On-hand 34 (~4p at avg8, 1p at spike40). In-transit 1255 (lost pile-up, unreliable). Near arrivals: P44 20 likely P46 LT2 (+54 total start P46). Covers low demand, risks stockout if holiday >50. (e) Order 50: Target post-holiday cover (3p x ~20 safety-stocked for LT=2 arrival P48 + variability/loss buffer), minimize holding (profit=holding=1) while preventing lost sales (~$50 profit at risk).",
