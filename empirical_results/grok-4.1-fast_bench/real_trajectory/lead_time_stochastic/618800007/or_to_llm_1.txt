Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows sporadic arrivals with frequent losses (e.g., P46 arrived=0, no consec 3+ yet; high in-transit 1057u mostly ghosts per carry-over). Recent reliable arrivals interrupted (P45 had 40u LT=2 from P43, but P46=0). Effective arriving pipeline low. Inventory analysis: On-hand=61 covers 6-12 periods at recent demand 5-10u/period; ending inv from P46=61 after demand=5. Demand analysis: Deep low demand sustained into year-end (P43-46 avg 7.25, P45-46=6.5 even lower), post-Christmas collapse as predicted (no holiday surge materialized); date 2019/12/30 (New Year's week) unlikely to spike for satin summer-ish blouse in winter. Historical spring peak irrelevant now. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and all-history demand (ignores regime shifts/losses). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - no need to order with ample stock, low demand outlook, holding cost risk, and ghost-inflated transit; preserves cash/avoid overstock as reward = profit*sold - holding*ending_inv.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - post-Christmas demand remains deeply low (P43-46 avg 7.25u) with 61 on-hand covering 8+ periods and unreliable arrivals.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-Christmas demand further deepened P44-46 avg 6 (-25% vs P40-43 avg 18), extending 24+ consecutive low periods P21-46 into year-end (monitor P47-48); no arrivals P46 (1 consec, not yet sustained).",
