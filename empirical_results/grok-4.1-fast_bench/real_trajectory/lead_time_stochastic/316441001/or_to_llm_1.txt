{
  "rationale": "Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas/New Year's week for long-sleeved jersey top; winter demand possible but recent history shows sustained post-holiday dip (P43-46 demands: 42/46/58/38, avg 46, -75% vs P33-41 high avg ~82 and P42 holiday spike 182). On-hand=526 covers 10+ periods at recent avg 46 demand, even without arrivals. In-transit=1090 dominated by ghosts/lost shipments (~1060u+ prior per carry-overs, recent pattern P40-P43 orders overdue/no-show). Lead times vary (recent: LT=2-3, occasional 1; promised 2), but irrelevant with high stock. OR recommends 0 using historical mean (ignores regime shifts, ghosts); agree fully\u2014no need to order as holding costs $1/u on 526 already high, prioritize inventory burn-down.
