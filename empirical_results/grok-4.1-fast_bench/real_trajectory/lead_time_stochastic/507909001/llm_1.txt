Historical early-year avg~145; recent winter low <<. (b) Demand stable winter low extended: P37-43 avg 110 (7 periods, range 50-158, -3% vs prior P37-41 114), volatile but sustained low (P42=150 brief, P43=50 confirms no holiday build-up); forecast P44 ~100.

(e) Order 200: modest buffer for potential Christmas spike (P44-47) while minimizing new holding risk (high on-hand + pipeline covers base LT=2+1=3 periods; profit 4>holding 1 justifies low-risk coverage over stockout).",

(e) Order 300: covers ~3 periods (~110*3=330) post-LT uncertainty, prevents stockouts (profit $4>>holding $1), matches recent low-demand orders while high in-transit mitigates overstock risk.",
