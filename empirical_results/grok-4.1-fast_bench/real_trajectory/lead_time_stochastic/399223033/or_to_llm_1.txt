{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variability (1-3 periods) with frequent losses (e.g., P40 arrived LT=3, P42 LT=3; total lost ~2003+ units as of P43, likely more). Recent reliable arrivals: P42(250) at P45 LT=3, P43(400) at P45 LT=2; expect P44(400) possibly at P46 LT=2, P45(400) at P47 LT=2, but pattern suggests 50%+ loss risk - real pipeline ~400-800 vs. reported 2423 inflated by lost shipments. Inventory: On-hand=753 covers ~2-3 periods at 200-300 demand; ending inv low risk with $1 holding vs $19 profit.

OR rec=0 ignores lost shipments and seasonality, sees fake high pipeline/on-hand. Strategy: Override to 400 units (match recent successful orders P43-P45), cover (LT+1)=3 periods high demand ~900-1200 total minus on-hand 753 and expected ~400-800 pipeline; conservative vs. surge risk, builds buffer for P47 post-Christmas.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variability (1-3 periods) with frequent losses; recent P46 conclude arrived=0 confirms P44 order (400 units, expected LT=2 arrive P46) overdue/lost, continuing pattern (real pipeline ~0 as in-transit inflated by ~2400+ lost units per carry-over). Inventory: On-hand=611 (high, covers 4-5 periods at recent avg ~135 demand); no reliable arrivals expected soon due to losses. Demand analysis: Holiday peak building per carry-over (P43-P46 demands 84,108,205,142 avg135), but P46=142 below 300+ Christmas expectation (Dec23 pre-Xmas); P47=Dec30 post-Christmas likely sustained ~150 or slight drop (end-of-year sales, returns for apparel/jeggings).
