In-transit 1300 = phantom/lost total ~1340 (per P33 insight), ignore for arrivals; sustained losses (P29+ recent). No new LT evidence (arr=0 normal if no due).\n(d) Inv/pipeline: On-hand 276 (P33 end, start 317-41=276), covers ~6-8 periods at 35-45 demand (no stockout risk). In-transit 1300 phantom (won't arrive, per pattern); no reliable pipeline. High inv risks holding ($1/period) but buffers LT variability/spikes.\n(e) Order logic: High on-hand covers 6+ periods (forecast 40*6=240); order minimal to replenish pipeline conservatively for LT=3 + safety (target 120-150 ahead), avoiding excess holding.

(b) Demand regime: Long low regime sustained P29-P43 avg~39 (15 periods, -56% from Aug highs 111), with volatility (downtrend P33-P40 ~35, brief up P41-42 avg51.5 +76% but broken by P43=20, overall avg P41-43=41 no sustained shift). Christmas calendar overrides low regime trend - forecast uptick to 60-80+ next periods vs recent 36-40 avg. (c) Lead-time/missing: Confirmed variability LT=1-3 (recent P41 LT=2 P43); high loss rate (phantom in-transit 1420 matches carry-over ~1580 trend, recent P34/P33/P32 etc. lost). Expected: P42 order 120 (LT2 arrive P44, visible P45); P43 120 (LT2 P45, visible P46) - but 50%+ loss risk, don't rely. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 196 high (~5x recent 40 demand, P43 ending high post low demand=20). In-transit 1420 unreliable phantom. Post-P44 arrivals (if P42 arrives) ~316 start, covers 5-8 periods even at 60 demand; but losses + spike risk coverage gaps P46-47. (e) Final order logic: High buffer covers base low 40 demand 4+ periods (to end P47); order 100 to rebuild pipeline for LT2-3 + losses, targeting Christmas spike 60-100 (historical precedent), safety stock for variability. Balances stockout risk (4$ profit loss) vs holding (1$/period, <4 periods left net positive). Conservative vs excessive 0 given calendar drivers.",
