On-hand=0, in-transit=2394 unreliable due to sustained lost shipment pattern (P1/P3/P4/P10/P14/P29/P34/P38 + recent potentials); recent arrivals sporadic (e.g., P45: 400 from P43 LT=2, but many overdue like P44 order 400 expected P46 LT=2 unconfirmed).

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LT variable (LT=2 for P43->P45, LT=3 for P40->P43, LT=2 for P39->P41); sustained loss pattern (P38 lost per prior insight, P44 order 400 overdue 1 period since expected P46 no arrival in P46 conclude). Promised L=2 unreliable. Inventory: On-hand=0 (stockout P46), in-transit=2794 bloated with accumulated lost shipments (prior insight sums prior losses + recent overdue like P44). Demand analysis: Holiday peak sustained P37-46 avg ~332 (P45=475, P46=462 stockout despite recent arrivals); post-Christmas 12/30 aligns with continued winter tights demand into Jan (historical Jan avg~107 but post-regime shift/winter surge ~270-300+); expect ~350-400 next periods despite potential slight post-holiday dip. OR recommendation: 0 units - ignores seasonality, losses, recent high demand/volatility (diluted by summer lows). Strategy: Override OR aggressively to 400 units - cover 3-period horizon (~1050-1200 demand) accounting for unreliable LT/losses; matches recent order pattern to rebuild pipeline post-stockouts (P46=462 lost sales); holding cost balanced by profit=1/unit, prioritize avoiding stockouts in peak winter.",
