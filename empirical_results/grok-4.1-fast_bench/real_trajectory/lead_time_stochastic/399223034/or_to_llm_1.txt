No new conclusions in P24.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised L=2 confirmed recently (P43 order arrived P45, LT=2); prior successes show variability (LT=1,2,3 observed across multiple cases, e.g., P44 order=200 expected P46 LT=2, P45=250 expected P47 LT=2). Lost shipments persist (older ones like P19=100u, P23=50u, etc., inflating in-transit to 1015u without delivery). Inventory position: OH=174 sufficient for 1 period high demand (~150-200); total pipeline=174+1015=1189u covers 6+ periods even at 179 avg, or 3+ periods if 50% lost. Demand analysis: Sustained holiday surge P42-45 avg 179 (338,122,130,126) vs P35-41 taper avg56 (+219%), confirmed over 4 periods with apparel seasonality; P46 date 2019/12/23 (Christmas Eve week) likely maintains high ~150-200 last-minute shopping, but post-P47 drop possible. OR rec=0 reflects high pipeline vs their low historical mu (ignores recent surge/seasonality), valid baseline. Strategy: Follow OR 0 - avoid over-ordering given massive pipeline coverage for (L+1)=3 periods demand (~537u needed) despite losses; recent deliveries arriving (e.g., P45=300u); prioritize avoiding excess holding on inflated pipeline while covered for peak.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent successful LT variable (LT=2 for P43->P45; prior LT=1/3 cases), but persistent losses (e.g., P44 order 200u overdue/no arrival P46 past LT=2 expectation, adding to pattern of P1/13/17/19/23/24/26/29 lost totaling >>1000u inflating in-transit 1015u - treat pipeline as unreliable, don't count on arrivals soon). Inventory: On-hand 52 low vs recent demand ~120-130 (P43-46 avg 125), will likely stockout P47 (sell 52/expected 120, end 0); in-transit 1015 mostly lost historically. Demand analysis: Holiday apparel surge sustained P42-46 avg 167.6 (338 BF spike + consistent 122-130) vs P35-41 taper 56 (+198%), now 5 periods confirming peak through Christmas/late Dec; 2019/12/30 post-Christmas still elevated for jeggings (denim trousers, seasonal winter/holiday relevance), expect ~120 demand P47 before potential NY lull. OR rec=0 ignores seasonality, losses, actual LT variability - its base-stock low due to early historical low demand (avg~18). Strategy: Override OR 0 to 150u targeting base-stock ~360 (3 periods LT+1 * ~120 mean) + safety, but conservative given losses/possible taper; ensures coverage for P47+ despite unreliable pipeline, critical fractile 0.8 favors stocking vs holding risk.",
