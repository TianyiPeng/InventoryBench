Date 2019/10/28 (late October, Halloween week but primarily pre-winter cold weather driver boosting sweatshirt demand; world knowledge: Northern Hemisphere fall transition to winter increases apparel demand for warm layers). (b) Demand regime: Sustained fall surge confirmed P30-37 avg 87.6 (range 48-138), recent P35-37 avg 92 (98/73/106); continuation of prior upshift (+178% vs summer lows), no new regime but stable high ~90-100/period into winter.

(c) Lead-time: Actual LT varies 1-3 periods (e.g., P33 LT3 P36, P35 LT1 P36, P30 LT2 P32); lost shipment pattern sustained (e.g., P34 order 100u placed P34 overdue 4+ periods past LT3, no P36/P37 arrival; prior P27 etc. lost). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 71 (covers ~0.7 periods at 100 demand); in-transit 750 largely at-risk/phantom due to sustained losses (~450+ prior lost, recent misses accumulate); effective arriving pipeline low/unreliable despite total (recent arrives sporadic: P37=0, P36=250, P35=0). P38 starts 71 + unknown arrivals (likely low given pattern). (e) Final order logic: Order 100 to replenish for ~1 period demand over LT~2 + unreliability buffer; balances stockout risk (71 <100 likely partial loss P38) vs holding (profit=holding=1, better over vs under given 10 periods left & winter demand); avoids excess amid phantom pipeline.",
