(c) Lead time: Confirmed variability LT=1-2 (e.g., P22 no arr, but prior P15/16 LT2/1, P18 LT1); lost shipments sustained (1500u in-transit from P1/3/4/10/13/14/17 etc., no arrivals overdue past LT=2, treat pipeline as 0 reliable). No new lost confirmed this period. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=52 (covers ~0.5 periods at 100/demand); in-transit=1500 (effectively 0, lost); no expected arrivals P23 (recent orders=0). Post-P23 stockout likely if demand>52. (e) Order logic: Order 250 to cover expected 3 periods demand (~100x3=300) minus on-hand 52, buffering LT=2 + safety for volatility/spike risk; balances stockout loss ($19/sale) vs holding ($1/period), proactive for potential fall rebound while minimizing overstock in summer.",

(b) Demand regime: Winter/holiday high sustained P36-P42 avg~116 (81-160 volatile, P42=148 confirms ramp into Dec); expect P43 spike 150-250+ (Cyber Monday boost), then high 120-200 thru Christmas (P43-P47 total ~700-900). (c) Lead time: Variable 1-3 confirmed (recent: P39 LT2, P36 LT3, P37 LT1); lost shipments sustained (new: P40 200u lost - no P42 arrival vs LT2 expected; pattern total ~3550u, explains 3150 in-transit bloat, unreliable pipeline). (d) Inventory/pipeline: OH=691 covers ~4-5 periods at 140 avg (strong buffer post-P42 148 demand); in-transit=3150 unreliable (many lost, sporadic arrivals e.g. P41=250); potential P43 arrival (P41 250u LT2 expected, but 50/50 odds). (e) Order logic: Order 300 to cover holiday spike/volatility + LT uncertainty (arrives P45-46 for endgame P46-47); balances sales (19x profit) vs holding ($1/period, end P47); avoids stockout risk despite high OH/pipeline, prioritizes service in peak.",
