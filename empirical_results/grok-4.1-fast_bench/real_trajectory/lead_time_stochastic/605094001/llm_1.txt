Date 2019/12/23: Christmas week (Dec 25 Wed), peak holiday shopping/last-minute gifts; underwear practical for gifts/stock-up. Historical peaks align (P42 Thanksgiving 143 demand). Expect P46 spike ~120-150 vs recent avg ~48. (b) Demand: Upshift sustained P39-P45 avg 48.3 (37,35,14,143,10,35,64), holiday vol confirmed (P42 peak 143, P45=64 building pre-Xmas vs P43 low 10); forecast P46 high 130 (holiday driver), P47 post-Xmas drop ~50. (c) LT=2 confirmed sustained recent (P39->P41, P41->P43, P43->P45 all LT2, no delays/lost recent). Expected: P46 arr=0 (P44 ord=0), P47 arr=120 (P45 ord). High in-transit 1080 bloated by historical lost orders (e.g. P17/P19 etc., ignore for arrivals). No overdue. (d) OH=151 covers P46 forecast 130 (end ~21). P47: ~21+120=141 start (covers ~50, end ~91). Effective pipeline solid, no gaps. High OH risks holding cost. (e) Order 0: Pipeline/OH covers 3+ periods at upshift/holiday rates; avoids excess holding (profit=holding=1); monitor post-P46 for adjustment.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "(a) Product: Fred Shortie 3-pack hipster briefs (cotton jersey underwear bottoms). Basic necessity with steady demand; holiday gifting/resolutions may influence but post-Christmas (2019/12/30, pre-NY Eve) likely moderate/normalization after peaks. Historical Jan-Feb avg ~151 high (pre-game), but game regimes shifted low then up. Recent holiday vol: P42 (Thanksgiving/11/25) peak 143, P43 post-peak dip 10; Xmas week P46 (12/23) 68 moderate. Forecast P47 ~50-70, conservative 60 avg recent non-peak.\n(b) Demand regime: Carry-over upshift P39-P44 avg 45.7 sustained; recent P44-P46 35/64/68 avg 55.7 (+22% short-term), P45-P46 66; overall P39-P46 avg ~50.8 sustained 8+ periods upward from prior lows, holiday vol confirmed. No abrupt new shift.\n(c) Lead time: LT=2 recent confirmed (P43 ord->P45 arr, P41->P43); LT=1 earlier (P35/37->36/38). P46 arr=0 expected (P44 ord=0). P45 ord 120 exp P47 LT2 (visible P48). No new concludes; high in-transit 1080 implies pipeline backlog/delays/pending old orders, no confirmed losses recently.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 83 (~1.5 periods @60 demand). In-transit 1080 massive (total pos 1163 >> needs for 20+ periods). Expected P47 arr incl P45's 120 + others; post-arrival ending will be high, accruing holding $1/unit/period.\n(e) Final order logic: Zero order; excessive pipeline/on-hand covers far future demand (even spikes to 140). Prioritize avoiding holding costs ($=profit), accept minor stockout risk if demand spikes but position ample. Reassess post-P47 arrivals.",
