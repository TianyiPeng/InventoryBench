High loss pattern persists (P44 arrived=0, ghost pipeline swelled to 2305 units all overdue 1-30+ periods per carry-over). Inventory analysis: On-hand 35 critically low (ending P44); in-transit 2305 ineffective due to confirmed lost shipments (no recent arrivals despite orders); effective pipeline near zero. Demand analysis: Peak Christmas holiday surge for nightwear (date 2019/12/16 mid-Dec, pre-Christmas gifting peak); recent P42=355, P43=165, P44=240 (avg 253, +32% vs P37-P41 ramp avg~142); sustained 3 periods at 165-355 confirms continued high demand 250+ expected P45-P47. OR recommendation 0 flawed: Ignores ghost losses, seasonality surge, low effective inventory; uses promised LT=2 and full history without recency/seasonal weighting. Strategy: Override OR aggressively; order 350 to target base-stock for (L+1)=3-4 periods high demand (~1000 total) minus low OH/effective pipeline, prioritizing sales in final periods (profit $19 >> holding $1); conservative vs prior surges but covers expected 250-350 P45+ peaks despite losses.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent concluded arrivals show LT variability 1-3 periods (e.g., P42 order arrived P45 LT=3; P43 LT=2; P44 no arrival in P46 confirm loss pattern); ghost pipeline at 2415 units (swelled from prior 2305, includes all overdue 1-30+ periods like P1/P3/etc., confirmed non-arrivals in recent concludes e.g. P46 arrived=0). Effectively, do not count in-transit as reliable supply - treat as lost based on sustained pattern. Inventory analysis: On-hand=378 ample for (L+1)=3 periods at recent avg demand ~130 (P43-P46 avg 163, but declining); covers post-holiday even at 150/demand.

Product is women's pyjama bottoms - seasonal winter/holiday high now tapering. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock capped by high pipeline/on-hand under promised LT=2 and full history mean; ignores ghosts/losses but aligns as on-hand buffers adequately).
