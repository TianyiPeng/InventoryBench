  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent concluded arrivals show LT variability persists (P40 order LT=3 to P43; P41 LT=2 to P43; prior mix of 1-3); no new dominant pattern beyond promised L=2, so plan for L=2-3 (cover 3-4 periods). Pipeline: In-transit 2434 units, but carry-over accumulated known/pending lost ~2300+ units (unreliable, discount heavily; effective pipeline ~100-200 units likely from recent orders, with some recent successes like P40/P41).

Historical summer highs ~130, recent volatile 100-200. OR rec 0: Likely due to high apparent pipeline/OH vs their historical low mu~55 (ignores regime shifts, losses, seasonality); valid baseline as effective coverage ample for remaining ~4 periods (47 total). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - avoid overordering/holding costs (1$/u/p) with 310 OH + partial pipeline sufficient for expected 100-150/period holiday demand (total need ~500-600 vs current ~400+ effective); monitor P44 demand for holiday confirmation.
