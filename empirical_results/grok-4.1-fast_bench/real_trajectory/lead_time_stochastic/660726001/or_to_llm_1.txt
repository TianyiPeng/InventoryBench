Inventory analysis: On-hand 109 (from P15 end), covers 3-5+ periods at recent demand ~20-50/unit; no arrivals expected in P16 (P14 order=0) or P17 (P15=0); high holding cost ($1/unit/period) equals profit, so prioritize drawdown to avoid excess ending inventory.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LT=2 (P43 order arrived P45), with historical variability 1-3 periods; no new concludes in P46 (arrived=0), consistent with lost/delay pattern. Older shipments (e.g., P46 order=150 now in-transit) expected LT=2 would arrive P48. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 entering P47, in-transit=1386 units (up from prior ~1286 + P46's 150 -0 arrivals); persistent lost pattern (carry-over ~55% discount sustained across 40+ periods, e.g., static blocks like 416/1136 units overdue 4-10+ periods) \u2192 effective reliable pipeline ~1386*0.45=623 units, ample for low-demand outlook. Demand analysis: Short-sleeve blouse (summer garment) in late Dec 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas/New Year's, cold winter); recent holiday spike sustained P45=115 (12/16), P46=71 (12/23) vs winter low avg~14 (+400-700%), but post-holiday lull expected (end-of-sales, returns, no seasonal relevance for short-sleeves in cold; prior winter P36-44 avg~17 confirms deep lull).

Strategy: Follow OR=0, preserve cash/avoid adding to loss-prone pipeline; high effective IP covers (L+1)=3+ periods at conservative \u03bc=25 (75 units), risk-minimal stockout given low outlook (stockout cost=profit=1 matches holding=1).
