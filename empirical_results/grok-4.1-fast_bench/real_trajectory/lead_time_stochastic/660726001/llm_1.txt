  "rationale": "(a) World knowledge/product: Women's straight-cut blouse with V-neck and short cap sleeves (upper body garment, suitable for mild weather or layering). Date 2019-02-11 (Monday), Valentine's Day on 2019-02-14 falls within this week (Period 1), likely driving gift/dating-related demand spike for women's apparel. Historical data shows ramp-up in late Jan/early Feb (0 on 1/7&1/14, then 13/21, 27/28, 26/2-4), aligning with pre-Valentine's buildup. (b) Demand regime: Initial low (avg 0 first 2wks), shifted to higher mean ~22 avg last 3wks (13-27-26); sustained increase evident but not yet confirmed as new regime (only 3pts). Forecast Period 1: 30+ due to V-day proximity. Subsequent: ~25 if trend holds. (c) Lead time: No history (Period 1, no prior concludes); assume promised 2 periods initially\u2014no missing orders to flag. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0 (Period 1&2 stockouts inevitable), in-transit=0; no pipeline cover. (e) Final order logic: Cover (L+1)=3 periods demand post-arrival (arrives Period 3). Base forecast 25/period x3=75; +25% safety for V-day volatility/trend (~19 extra) totals 94, rounded to 90. Balances stockout risk (profit loss) vs holding (equal cost); conservative start given ramp.",

Historical demand (prior weeks): 0 (Jan7), 0(Jan14), 13(Jan21), 27(Jan28), 26(Feb4) shows ramp-up; Period 1 (Feb11): 60 confirms sharp increase possibly tied to pre-spring/holiday anticipation. (b) Demand regime: Single period spike to 60 (+131% vs prior 26), but not yet sustained (needs 3+ periods); forecast ~50-70/period short-term, monitoring for confirmation. (c) Lead time: Promised 2 periods; Period 1 order (90) shows arrived=0 in P1 conclude (expected, as LT>=1 means no same-period arrival); in-transit 90 expected to arrive during P3 (visible P3 conclude, read P4). No evidence of deviation/loss yet (too early). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout risk for P2 demand ~60); in-transit=90 covers ~1.5 periods (P3+P4 partial). No ending inventory charges yet. Pipeline aligns with LT=2. (e) Order logic: Stockout in P1/P2 loses profit (=holding cost); order 120 to cover 2 periods' demand (~60ea) for P4+P5 (arrives P4), building buffer for uncertainty/spike/possible LT drift while profit=holding balances over/under-stock risk.

  "rationale": "(a) Product is women's straight-cut blouse with V-neck and short cap sleeves (upper body garment), favoring warmer seasons; short sleeves align with summer peak (P20-P26 avg~155) and winter lows (P38-P41 avg14). Date 2019/12/30 (Mon, NYE eve post-Christmas P46 12/23) signals post-holiday decline for apparel; no major blouse demand drivers (NYE party wear minimal for casual blouse), expect winter low regime persistence (~10-30 units). (b) Demand regimes: winter low confirmed (P38-P41 avg14); recent holiday spike P45(115)-P46(71) avg93 (+ve from prior ~10), but single 2-period uptick vs sustained lows; forecast P47~30-50 (post-Xmas drop, NYE minor lift), reverting to ~20 avg. (c) Lead time varies 1-3 periods (recent: P40->P43 lt3, P42->P45 lt3, P43->P45 lt2); supplier resumed P43-P45 (3 successes post-10yr failure P33-42), no new losses (P46 arrived=0 normal, no overdue flags); promised lt2 holding. No lost shipments evident. (d) On-hand=82 (covers ~3-4 periods at ~20-30 forecast); in-transit=1300 massive (accumulated pipeline, expect arrivals P48-P50+ per lt2-3), will flood post-P47 causing high holding; total coverage excessive for low demand. (e) Order 0: 82 on-hand + incoming 1300 overcovers low winter demand (lt+1=3 periods buffer ample); avoid adding to pipeline/excess holding (cost=profit), prioritize sell-through of existing.",
