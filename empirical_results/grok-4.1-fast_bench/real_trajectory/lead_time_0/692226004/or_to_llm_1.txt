Inventory analysis: On-hand=111 (from Period 32 ending), in-transit=0; pipeline inventory=111, sufficient for 5-7 periods at recent low demand levels (~15-20/unit). Demand analysis: Deepening end-of-summer decline confirmed by carry-over insights (e.g., P29-P31 avg=16 with drops 24>18>6); P32=15 maintains low regime (P29-P32 avg=15.75, -85% vs summer peaks ~120). Calendar/product context: Late September 2019 (9/23), tank top (summer apparel) demand minimal post-summer, no boosting events (e.g., no heatwaves or holidays); expect continued low ~10-20. OR recommendation: 21 units based on full historical mean (diluted by early peaks, ignores recency/seasonality); uncapped likely low due to high pipeline but we override downward.
