No strong seasonal spike evident yet for this category.\n(b) Demand regime: Historical samples (5 weeks to 2019-02-04): 126,120,128,113,161. Mean=129.6, std~20. Recent uptick (last=161, avg last 3=134). Stable low-variance regime around 130; no confirmed shift.\n(c) Lead time: Promised 0 periods. No concluded periods yet (Period 1 start), so no inference possible. No in-transit or missing orders.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No coverage for Period 1 demand (satisfies after arrival).\n(e) Final order logic: With LT=0 promised (same-period arrival), order covers expected Period 1 demand + modest safety buffer (holding $1<<$19 profit). Forecast=140 (historical mean 130 + recent uptick buffer). Order 140 to target high service, low hold risk.",
