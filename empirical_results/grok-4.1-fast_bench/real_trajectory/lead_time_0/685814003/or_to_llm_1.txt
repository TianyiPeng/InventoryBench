Demand analysis: Hoodie post-Christmas (12/30) in winter season; recent holiday surge peaked BF P42=404, post-BF lull P43=73, partial rebound P44-P46 avg126 (+73% from P43 dip), but P46=111 signals tapering; no major New Year's surge expected for hoodies, expect moderate winter demand ~100-150. OR recommendation: 0 units, using historical data and promised L=0; aligns perfectly with high inventory and no immediate need. Strategy: Follow OR at 0 to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while 550 buffer avoids stockouts; critical fractile q=4/(4+1)=0.8 implies high service but current position exceeds base-stock needs.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - on-hand inventory of 550 provides ample coverage for expected post-Christmas winter demand around 120 units (P44-P46 avg), avoiding unnecessary holding costs.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-Black Friday holiday demand tapering confirmed P44-P46 avg 126 (+73% from P43=73 dip), sustained 3 periods (12/9-23); post-Christmas stabilization signal into late Dec (P47=12/30), monitor for winter plateau.",
