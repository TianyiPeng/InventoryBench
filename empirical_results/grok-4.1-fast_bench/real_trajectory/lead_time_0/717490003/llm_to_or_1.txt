Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), basic jersey T-shirt (Cat Tee). Historical demand: high early Jan (49,47 avg48), shifted down to low regime Jan21-Feb4 (19,15,14 avg16, -67%). Post-CNY (Feb5), winter low demand likely. No game history, pipeline=0, on-hand=0. Changelpoint confirmed at 2019-01-21 (sudden drop, sustained 3wks). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to match low regime (mu~(1+0)*16=16, low sigma~2.6); L=default (promised 0, no obs yet). Balances service (covers ~16) vs holding (avoids overstock at p=h=1, q=0.5 median-ish).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-01-21: avg decreased from 48 to 16 (-67%), sustained 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18, Presidents' Day). Basic jersey T-shirt (upper body garment); February winter timing suggests sustained low demand. Carry-over confirms regime shift to low demand since 2019-01-21 (avg 16 over 01-21/28/02-04). Period 1 demand=21 (slightly higher, possibly minor holiday lead-in), but single point lacks sustained evidence for change. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue or lost shipments. Lead time confirmed 0 (Period 1: ordered/arrived Period 1). No changepoint update needed. Parameters: L default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat explicit 17.25 = mean of post-shift demands (19+15+14+21)/4, bridging historical regime + new Period 1 data for ~17-18 base_stock to cover recent demand, reduce stockouts (lost 5 last period) while limiting hold risk (q=0.5). sigma_hat explicit 3.3 = std dev of same 4 recent demands, reflects low volatility vs. full-sample default ~17.6; minimally impacts cap (non-binding).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/02/25), basic jersey T-shirt (upper body garment). Carry-over notes demand downshift to ~16 avg at 2019-01-21 sustained 3 periods (19,15,14), but recent: Period 1 (2/11) demand=21 (+21% vs prior 14), Period 2 (2/18)=43 (+105% vs P1); possible late-winter/early-spring uptick for T-shirts, no major calendar events immediate. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments (P1 & P2 orders arrived same-period, lead_time=0 confirmed twice). Prior low orders (16,18) caused lost sales (5+25 units). No new sustained changepoint (uptrend only 2 periods). L=default (promised 0, matches observed). mu_hat=recent_N N=3 (last 3 demands:14,21,43 mean=26; regime post-downshift length~3, adapts moderately to uptick without overreacting to P2 spike). sigma_hat=default. With q=0.5 (z=0), base_stock=mu_hat~26; order~26 (covers recent avg, reduces lost sales vs prior while symmetric p=h limits hold risk); cap larger via sigma.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4): Basic T-shirt demand shows sharp upward regime shift in game history vs initial historical data (initial post-drop avg ~17, now P1:21, P2:43, P3:79, avg 47.7 +180%). No calendar events in early March 2019 driving T-shirt spike, but pattern sustained 3 periods with stockouts each time (ending OH=0). Lead times confirmed 0 for all 3 prior periods (P1-P3 orders arrived same period). Pipeline empty, on-hand=0; need to ramp up base stock. Use recent_3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture new high mean/volatility regime (N=3 as regime_length=3). L default (promised/observed=0). This boosts mu_hat~(1+0)*47.7=47.7 (prior default ~29), sigma_hat~sqrt(1)*29.3 (prior ~18), raising base_stock/ cap to cover rising demand, balance q=0.5 service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting game Period 1 (2019/2/11): avg increased from ~17 (historical 2019-01-21 to 02-04) to 47.7 (+180%), sustained 3 periods with stockouts.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), early March, Cat Tee T-shirt; recent demands consistently high post-regime shift starting P1: 21,43,79,39 (avg 45.5, +167% vs prior historical ~17), sustained 4 periods despite one dip to 39; no new changepoint as still elevated. Lead times confirmed 0 across all 4 periods (P1-P4 concludes). On-hand=9 low, in-transit=0, no overdues/losses. Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture ongoing high-demand regime/volatility (std~24); L=default (0). With p=h=1, q=0.5 targets median~45.5, order~36 to cover expected demand minus on-hand, minimizing stockouts/holdings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18), mid-March, T-shirt (Cat Tee, jersey basic). Demand regime remains elevated per carry-over (shift to ~47.7 avg from historical winter low ~17, sustained 5+ game periods: P1-5 demands 21,43,79,39,48; mean=46). High variance noted (P3=79 spike). All observed lead times=0 (P1-5 arrives same period, no losses/delays). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline. Parameters use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current high-demand regime (N=5=max regime length available); L=default (promised=0, matches all history). This boosts base_stock to cover ~46\xb1recent std over 1 period, balancing profit=holding=1 (q=0.5) while preventing stockouts without excess hold.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Late March, spring season starting, T-shirt demand expected to rise seasonally. Game demands since P1: 21,43,79,39,48,122 (mean=58.7, sustained high regime vs pre-game ~17 avg, +180% shift confirmed). All 6 observed lead times=0 (consistent, no losses/delays). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent stockouts. No overdue shipments. Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/vol regime (N=6=regime length since P1). L=default (promised 0, matches all observations). This sets mu_hat=(1+0)*58.7\u224859, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*~35, enabling backend base_stock=\u03bc\u0302 (z\u22480 for q=0.5) to cover ~59 demand, reducing stockouts vs default low historical mean.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1), early spring for t-shirt (Cat Tee, jersey basic); seasonal demand drivers likely contributing to surge as weather warms. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments\u2014all 7 prior orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed consistently). Demands: recent P5-7 (48,122,148) avg=106 (+135% vs P1-4 avg=45.5), high volatility; changepoint at P6 with sustained 3-period high-demand regime and stockouts. L=default (promised 0, matches all observations). mu_hat=recent_N N=3 and sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 to target elevated mean/volatility over 1+L=1 period, yielding higher base_stock ~106 + z*50 (q=0.5) to cover surging demand, reduce lost sales (profit=1), minimize holding (cost=1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg increased from 45.5 (P1-4) to 106 (P5-7, +135%), sustained 3 periods with stockouts.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring; t-shirt basics see sustained high demand regime from P5-8 (48,122,148,108; avg 106.5, +135% vs prior 45.5), confirmed by carry-over shift at P6 with stockouts. No major calendar events immediate (Easter ~4/21 may lift later). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments; all historical lead times=0 (promised). Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent regime (N=4=max(min(regime_length~4,20),3)); default L=0. This boosts base_stock ~106+ to cover elevated mu/vol, balancing q=0.5 service vs holding amid stockouts.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), spring season for T-shirts (Cat Tee, jersey basic); recent demand regime high since P5 (carry-over P6 shift confirmed +135% to ~106 avg P5-7, continued P8=108); P9=60 drop is single period (not sustained 3+), so regime persists with P5-9 avg=97.2. No calendar events imminent (Easter 4/21 may boost, but proactive). All 9 prior lead times=0 (promised), no losses/delays, in-transit=0, on-hand=47 (from P9 end). Use recent_N=5 (regime length=5 periods P5-9, max(min(5,20),3)=5) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high mean/volatility (~97/45); L default=0 as consistent. Ensures base_stock~97 (q=0.5,z~0), order~50 to cover post-on-hand demand, minimizing stockout/holding.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter (April 21, 2019), Cat Tee T-shirt demand likely normalizing after spring/holiday peaks. Consistent lead time=0 across all 10 periods (no losses, in-transit=0). Demands P1-10 avg 74.2, but high regime from P6 shift sustained P6-10 (122,148,108,60,74 avg 102.4, +125% vs P1-5 avg 46), regime_length=5 periods, so N=5 for recent regime. On-hand=24 low vs expected ~100, will trigger order to rebuild base stock. recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat adapts to sustained high mean/volatility while capturing recent softening (P9-10 avg67), L default=0 ensures OR uses correct pipeline timing. With q=0.5, balances stockouts vs holding.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29), late spring, t-shirt demand remains high post-Easter (P11 demand=104 near 04-22 Easter). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline or overdue shipments\u2014all prior orders confirmed L=0. Recent demand regime (per carry-over P6 shift) volatile but elevated: P7-11 demands [148,108,60,74,104], mean~98.8 (high avg), high std~37 (volatility from P9 dip not sustained, P11 rebound). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current high-demand regime (regime_length>=5 periods, evidence: sustained >100 except transient P9). L=default (confirmed 0 across 11 periods). Parameters target base_stock~99 (mu_hat=99 + z*sigma~37, z~0 for q=0.5), ordering ~99 to cover expected demand, balance sales vs holding given profit=holding=1.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

All 12 observed lead times=0 (consistent with promised). Demand regime shift at P6 sustained 7 periods (P6-12: mean=111, volatile std~34), recent P10-12 avg=113 confirms upward pressure. Use default L (0). recent_7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high-demand regime, scaling backend base_stock upward vs low historical samples (mean~29); balances q=0.5 service vs holding with elevated mean/volatility for coverage.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13), mid-May post-Mother's Day (May 12). T-shirt demand volatile: recent P9-13: 60,74,104,160,45 (mean~88.6, high std~43). P13 low at 45 after P12 high 160, but single period not sustained shift (needs 3+). Prior carry-over high demand regimes (e.g., P6+ avg~106) still relevant amid volatility. All historical lead times confirmed 0 periods (13/13 observations), no in-transit or losses; on-hand 66 covers low demand but risks stockout on highs (up to 160). Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent mean/volatility over full history (mean~81); scales to (1+0)=1 period. L default (promised 0). Ensures backend base_stock ~89 (z=0 since profit=holding=1), order ~23 + cap buffer for sigma, balancing hold cost on 66 vs service on volatile demand.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20), basic t-shirt (Cat Tee, jersey). Mid-May, pre-Memorial Day (5/27) may slightly boost apparel demand, but no major spikes expected. On-hand=19, in-transit=0; all historical orders (P1-14) arrived with confirmed LT=0, no losses/overdues. Demand regime from P6-P14 (9 periods): mean=99 (122,148,108,60,74,104,160,45,70), sustained high vs prior (carry-over confirms shift at P6). Recent P13-14 (45,70) lower but only 2 periods, not sustained changepoint (requires 3+). L=default (promised/actual 0). mu_hat=recent_N N=9 (regime length=9, max(min(9,20),3)=9) for (1+0)*99 demand forecast. sigma_hat=recent_N N=9 for volatility ~40. With q=0.5 z=0, base_stock~99; order~80 to target coverage for ~99 demand from low 19 on-hand, balancing sold vs holding (p=h=1). Cap accommodates variance.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, Memorial Day holiday - potential T-shirt demand spike for summer/BBQ season). On-hand=27 low, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical lead times=0 confirmed). Recent demands P11-15: 104,160,45,70,72 (mean~90, high volatility post-P6 upward shift). P13 dip to 45 not sustained (rebounded to 70-72). Anticipate ~90 demand; low inventory risks stockout. L=default (promised/reliable 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N=5 to use recent high-demand regime for accurate (1+0)=1 period forecast, enabling base_stock~90 (z=0) and cap~90+1.645*sigma to cover spikes without excess hold.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3), early summer start for t-shirt (Cat Tee, jersey basic); expect sustained/seasonal demand around recent highs (P16=120 post-Memorial Day 5/27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; all prior 16 orders arrived LT=0 (no losses/overdues). Demands volatile post-regime shift at P6 (carry-over P8: avg P1-5=46 to P6-16=98.45 +113%), sustained 11 periods (P6-P16: 122,148,108,60,74,104,160,45,70,72,120; evidence=multiple 100+ spikes, avg>early). No new changepoint (P13 low=45 isolated, recent P14-16=70/72/120 mixed). L=default (confirmed 0). mu_hat=recent_N N=11 (regime length=11>=3, cap20) for ~98 vs all~82, targets higher recent mean to cut stockouts (e.g., P16). sigma_hat=recent_N N=11 captures volatility (helps cap if future pipeline>0). Since q=0.5 z=0, base_stock=mu_hat; order~98 covers (L+1)=1 period demand, balances profit/holding.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10), early summer for T-shirt product (Cat Tee, jersey basic); warmer weather drives sustained high demand potential. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; all 17 prior orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0), no losses/overdues. Demand regime high since P6 (carry-over confirmed, now sustained 12 periods P6-P17 avg=98.5 vs P1-P5 avg=46, +113%; volatility up std~35 vs early~21). Recent: P17=99 (perfect match), P16=120, P15=72. L=default (confirmed 0). mu_hat=recent_N N=12 ((1+0)*98.5\u224899). sigma_hat=recent_N N=12 (recent vol~35). With q=0.5 (profit=holding=1), base_stock\u224899; pipeline=0 so order~99, targets recent avg to minimize stockouts (frequent in history) vs holding, anticipates summer stability.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17), summer T-shirt (Cat Tee, basic jersey); Father's Day just passed (June 16), possible post-event dip in P18 demand=62. On-hand=37 low, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments\u2014all 18 prior orders arrived same period (lead_time=0). Demand regime elevated since changepoint at P6 (carry-over Period 8: avg 106 P5-7 vs prior 45.5, sustained >>3 periods); last 13 periods (P6-P18) avg demand=95.7 (1244/13), high volatility (std~37, spikes to 160). Historical samples (pre-game low ~29 avg) irrelevant. Use recent_N N=13 (regime_length=13 since P6 shift, min(13,20)=13) for mu_hat=(1+0)*95.7\u224896 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*37\u224837; L default (promised=0, matches all observed).

Period 22 (2019/7/8), summer t-shirt demand context: recent high volatility with P21 spike to 211 (possibly July 4th holiday effect, week ending 7/1 includes Independence Day). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline; massive stockout in P21 (demand 211 > ordered 95). Lead time consistently 0 across all 21 prior periods (every order arrived same period, no losses/delays). No overdue shipments. Current regime post last carry-over shift (P6 avg~106), but demands varied ~60-160 lately, recent uptick. Use recent_5 (P17-21 demands:99,62,94,100,211; mean=113.2) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated recent level/volatility (~std=56.8) while L=0 so mu_hat=113.2 covers 1-period forecast; helps OR backend target base_stock~113 (z=0 since profit=holding=1) to reduce stockouts without excess holding. Default L=0 reliable.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15), mid-summer; t-shirts expect sustained high demand in July heat (P21:211, P22:146 stockouts). All 22 concluded periods confirm actual LT=0 (no in-transit, no losses). On-hand=0, pipeline=0; must order for current demand. Demand volatile but recent regime shift upward (carry-over P8 + recent July spikes +97% vs prior avg~85). Changepoint at P21 (211 vs P20:100), sustained 2/3 periods toward high summer peak. Use recent_N=5 (P18-22: demands 62/94/100/211/146, avg=122.6, regime length~5 volatile highs); N=5 per checklist (min(regime,20),>=3). Default L=0. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 capture peak/volatility for base_stock~123 (z=0,q=0.5), order~123 vs holding cost; cap covers safety. Prevents lost sales (recent stockouts P21/P22).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22), late July summer peak for t-shirts; expect sustained high demand. Confirmed L=0 across all 23 periods, no losses or delays (in-transit=0, on-hand=17 low vs recent demand). Demand changepoint at P21: avg 154 (P21-23:211/146/106) vs prior P16-20 avg~95 (+62%), sustained 3 periods with stockouts P21-22. Use recent_N=3 (regime_length=3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture volatility (std~53); default for L. Parameters raise base_stock ~154 + z*53 (q=0.5,z~0) to ~154, covering expected demand post low on-hand, prioritizing profit from sales over holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg increased from 95 (P16-20) to 154 (P21-23, +62%), sustained 3 periods with stockouts.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29), end-July summer period for basic jersey T-shirt; demand typically steady-high in summer. Confirmed regime shift at P21 (noted in carry-over) sustained 4 periods (P21-24: demands 211,146,106,103; avg 141.5, +47% over P16-20 avg 95), with stockouts P21-22. P23-24 lower (106,103) but still elevated vs prior regime, no new downward shift sustained. All historical LT=0 confirmed (24/24 observations), no in-transit/overdues. On-hand=52 low vs expected ~140 demand; will likely stockout without order. L=default (promised=actual=0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 (regime_length=4; max(min(4,20),3)=4) to capture elevated mean/volatility (std~50); sets base_stock\u2248141 (z=0 for q=0.5), order\u2248141-52=89 to cover demand while minimizing excess holding (profit=holding=1).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5), early August summer peak for T-shirts, potential back-to-school ramp-up. Recent demands P21-25: 211,146,106,103,86 (avg 130.4, declining from July 4th spike). On-hand 56 low vs recent ~100 avg, risk stockout if demand rebounds. All lead times consistently 0 periods (25 observations), no in-transit or losses. No overdue shipments. Carry-over regime shift at P21 sustained high to P23 (avg154), but P24-25 lower (103,86), not yet sustained new downward shift (only 2 periods). Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to weight current declining regime (N=5, regime_length>5 since P21 shift, cap20). L default=0. mu_hat=(1+0)*130.4\u2248130 targets base stock to cover expected demand (z=0 since q=0.5). sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*47.5\u224847.5 accounts for volatility. Helps OR balance by inflating recent mean/vol to avoid stockouts while holding cost=profit limits overstock.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12), mid-August back-to-school season for apparel like basic T-shirts, but recent demands P24-26 (103,86,82) show sustained downward shift post-July peak (avg 90 vs prior 154 at P21-23), confirmed by 3 periods of lower demand without stockouts. All historical lead times=0 (26 observations, no drifts/losses), in-transit=0, on-hand=49 may cover partial demand (~90 expected). No overdue shipments. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture new lower mean/variance regime (backend computes (1+0)*mean/std last 3 ~90/16), L=default (promised 0 matches all data). This lowers base_stock to avoid excess holding post-peak while covering recent volatility, balancing q=0.5 service.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: avg decreased from 154 (P21-23) to 90 (P24-26, -42%), sustained 3 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2, Labor Day Monday - potential demand driver for T-shirts with end-of-summer/back-to-school sales, similar to July 4th spike at P21 demand=211). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline or overdue shipments; LT consistently 0 periods across all 29 concluded periods (e.g., P29 order arrived P29). Current demand regime since changepoint at P24 (downshift to ~90 avg, per carry-over), sustained 6 periods (P24-29 demands:103,86,82,59,90,118; avg=89.7). P29=118 elevated but single observation, not yet sustained shift. Use L default (promised 0, confirmed). mu_hat recent_N=6 and sigma_hat recent_N=6 to reflect current regime mean ~90 and volatility, overriding initial low historical samples (mean~29). With profit=holding=1 (q=0.5, z=0), base_stock=mu_hat ~90; orders ~90 (pipeline=0), targets median demand to balance sales vs holding; recent sigma ensures proper cap.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9), early September, end of summer season for T-shirt (Cat Tee, jersey basic); demand likely softening post-summer peaks. Lead time consistently 0 across all 30 periods, no in-transit or losses. Recent demand regime shift at P24 confirmed (carry-over: avg down to ~90 P24-26, extended to P24-30 avg 84.1 over 7 periods: 103,86,82,59,90,118,51), sustained >3 periods with volatility (std~23.4). On-hand 39, no pipeline; recent demands avg~84 exceed on-hand, risk stockout (e.g., P29 demand 118>84 sold). Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=7 since P24 changepoint) to forecast (1+0)*84.1 mean, sqrt(1+0)*23.4 std; L=default (0). With profit=holding=1, q=0.5 z=0 so base_stock=mu_hat~84, order~84-39=45 < cap~122, balances service vs holding while adapting to lower regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

All 31 periods confirm lead_time=0 (no in-transit, no losses). On-hand=57 covers recent low demand. Last regime shift at P24 (carry-over Period 27 insight: down from 154 to ~90 P24-26), sustained through P31 (8 periods: demands 103,86,82,59,90,118,51,28; avg~77, volatile but lower). Use recent_8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture this regime (N=8=max(min(8,20),3)). L=default (promised=0, confirmed). Sets base_stock~77 (z=0 since q=0.5); order~20 to cover expected demand/volatility, minimizing holding while preventing stockout on spikes (e.g., P29=118); sigma irrelevant to base but ensures cap>base.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Late September, early fall; t-shirt demand dropping post-summer (P30-32: 51,28,37 avg~39). New changepoint at P30: demand decreased from ~90 (P24-29 avg 89.7) to ~39 (P30-32, -57%), sustained 3 periods with no recent stockouts but prior at P28-29. All 32 periods show actual lead_time=0 (no losses, in-transit=0). On-hand=41 exceeds recent mean~39. Use recent_3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low-demand regime (N=3=max(min(3,20),3)); L=default (confirmed 0). Sets low mu_hat~39 (base_stock=mu_hat since z=0 for q=0.5), likely order~0 given pipeline=41, minimizing holding costs while accepting stockout risk per profit=holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg decreased from 90 (P24-29) to 38 (P30-32, -57%), sustained 3 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): End of September, basic T-shirt demand remains low post-summer, aligning with seasonal drop and carry-over regime shift at P30 (demands P30-33: 51,28,37,51; avg=41.75, -57% from prior ~90). No in-transit or overdue shipments; all historical lead times confirmed 0 periods consistently. On-hand=0 risks stockout. Use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture sustained low-demand regime (length=4 >=3), scaling backend base_stock to ~42 mean with low vol for q=0.5 balance (profit=holding=1). L=default (promised=0, matches all observed). Addresses low demand without overstocking given holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7): Early October, fall season starting; T-shirt demand expected low/declining (non-seasonal peak). Recent demand regime shift at P30 confirmed/sustained (P30-34 demands: 51,28,37,51,38; mean=41, vs prior 90; now 5+ periods). On-hand=4 low, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all historical LT=0 confirmed). No pipeline risk. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target low mean ~41*(1+0)=41 and recent volatility; default L=0 (consistent observed LT). Balances low base_stock to minimize holding (profit=holding=1, q=0.5) while covering current regime, avoiding overstock in declining demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Mid-October, fall season approaching winter; T-shirt demand expected low/declining (no major events, cooling weather reduces apparel demand). Low demand regime since changepoint at Period 30 (carry-over Period 33 insight: avg ~38 P30-32), now sustained 6 periods (P30-35 demands:51,28,37,51,38,26; avg=38.5). Recent 3 periods (P33-35:51,38,26 avg=38.3) confirm continuation, no new shift. On-hand=15 low vs. recent avg~38 (risk stockout); in-transit=0, all historical orders arrived with lead_time=0 (no losses/overdues). Use recent_N=6 (regime length=6, max(min(6,20),3)) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low mean/vol (~10.8 std); L=default (confirmed 0). Balances service (covers ~38+ z*11) vs holding with q=0.5.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21), late October, fall season transitioning to cooler weather; basic cat t-shirt demand low and dropping (P34-36: 38,26,18 avg 27), continuing low regime since P30 shift (P30-36 demands avg 35.6, sustained 7 periods vs prior ~90). No calendar spikes expected (Halloween minor for basic tee). Lead times consistently 0 periods across all 36 periods, no losses/overdues, in-transit=0. On-hand=21 covers recent low demand ~30. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current low-demand regime (N=7=max(min(7,20),3)), default L=0. This sets low base_stock ~35 (z~0), order~14 to replenish without excess holding, balancing profit/holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4): Early November, basic T-shirt demand low due to winter seasonality (post-Halloween, pre-holidays; historical Jan low teens-40s). Consistent LT=0 all 38 periods, no losses/overdues, in-transit=0, on-hand=18. Recent demands P36-38:18,24,17 (avg 19.7, std~3.8), changepoint at P36: drop from 38.5 avg P30-35 (-49%). Previous low regime P30+ confirmed continuing lower. Use recent_3 (regime_length=3, N=max(min(3,20),3)=3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low mu~20/sigma~4 (1+L=1), base_stock~mu (q=0.5,z=0) covers low demand, minimizes holding on 18 OH + order; default L=0. Cap ample. No pipeline gaps.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

All historical lead times=0 (no in-transit/losses), on-hand=5 low vs recent demand. Use recent_N=6 (regime length=6 since P36 changepoint) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low mean/vol regime (mu~16, sigma~4.7), yielding base_stock~16 (q=0.5, z~0), order~11 to cover demand while minimizing holding (p=h=1).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02, Cyber Monday): On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline. All 42 prior periods confirm lead_time=0 consistently, no losses. Recent demand regime shift at P39 (per carry-over): P36-38 avg~20 to P39-42:15,11,12,22 avg=15 (-25% from prior regime), sustained 4 periods with low demands but P42=22 uptick possibly pre-holiday/Cyber Monday signal. However, no sustained evidence of new shift (only 1 period up). Product is basic Cat Tee (jersey T-shirt); winter/holiday demand uncertain but Cyber Monday may spike apparel sales modestly. Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to track low regime (mean~15, low vol), yielding base_stock~15 (z=0 since q=0.5). L default=0. Orders ~15 to cover expected demand, minimizing holding risk vs. recent stockouts/low inventory patterns while backend cap provides buffer.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), pre-Christmas (Dec 25 ~2 weeks away), but basic jersey t-shirt demand typically low in winter; recent demands P39-43 (15,11,12,22,7) avg 13.4 confirm sustained low regime from P39 shift (carry-over P42), with P43=7 continuing downtrend despite P42=22 outlier. On-hand=8 sufficient for low demand, in-transit=0, all past orders arrived LT=0 (no losses). Use L default (promised 0, matches all history). mu_hat recent_5 captures low mean regime (N=5=max(min(5,20),3)). sigma_hat recent_5 for recent volatility (std~5.5). Balances low service need vs holding cost (profit=holding=1), targets base_stock ~13 + z*5, avoids overstock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), pre-Christmas (Dec 25 on P46?), basic jersey T-shirt (Cat Tee) shows sustained low winter demand regime from P39 (avg ~12.5 over P39-44: demands 15,11,12,22,7,8), consistent with carry-over shift at P39 (-36% to 12.7 P39-41) and historical Jan lows. No holiday spike evidence yet; P42 (Nov25 pre-Thanksgiving) 22 was anomaly followed by drop to 7-8. On-hand=6, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments\u2014all LT=0 confirmed historically. Use L default (promised 0, matches all observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=6 captures low mean~12.5/vol~5.5 for (1+0) period. With q=0.5 (p=h=1), base stock ~median 12-13 covers low demand, minimizes holding on low inventory; OR cap irrelevant low demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23, Christmas week). T-shirt demand typically low in winter; recent demands P39-45 (15,11,12,22,7,8,16) confirm sustained low regime (avg ~13, consistent with Period 42 carry-over shift to 12.7 avg P39-41, extended). No holiday spike evident (P43-45 Dec:7,8,16). All historical arrivals confirm LT=0 (no delays/losses, in-transit=0, on-hand=0). No overdue shipments. Use default L=0 (promised/observed). recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target low regime mean~13/vol~5, ensuring base_stock covers ~1 period demand post-decision (balances service vs holding at q=0.5).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30), post-Christmas/New Year's Eve eve; basic t-shirt demand low in winter, sustained low regime since changepoint at P39 (carry-over Period 42: avg 12.7 P39-41, extended P39-46 demands [15,11,12,22,7,8,16,16] avg 13.4, std ~4.9). No overdue shipments; all historical lead times=0 (46 observations), on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use L default (promised 0). mu_hat recent_8 (regime_length=8 since P39, P39-46), sigma_hat recent_8 for low volatility. Backend base_stock \u224813.4 (z=0 for q=0.5), orders ~13 covering recent mean demand, minimizes holding while avoiding frequent recent stockouts (e.g., P46: demand16>sold13). No calendar-driven spike evident for t-shirt.
