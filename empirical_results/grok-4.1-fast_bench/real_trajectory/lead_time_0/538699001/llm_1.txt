Feb in northern hemisphere is winter, but indoor layering or mild weather possible. (b) Historical demand: 98,95,128,120,190 (avg 126, but upward trend: early Jan ~96 avg, late Jan ~124 avg, Feb spike +54% to 190); no game history yet, so prior seeded as baseline with recent high as signal. Forecast Period 1 (2019-02-11): 150-200, blending avg+recent spike. (c) Promised lead time 0; no conclude messages yet, so no inference possible \u2013 assume 0 for now, order arrives same period. No missing orders. (d) On-hand 0, in-transit 0; pipeline empty \u2013 must order to cover current demand (post-decision arrival). (e) Order 180 to cover high-end forecast (190 recent) with minor safety (profit $4 > holding $1); avoids stockout loss (lost profit + future learning), low hold risk for 1 period; conservative start to probe demand regime over 47 periods.",
