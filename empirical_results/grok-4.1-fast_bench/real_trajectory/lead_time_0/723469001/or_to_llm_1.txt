Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42/47) is late November; Black Friday Nov 29 falls within this week, and Christmas (Dec 25) ~1 month away - women's push-up bras/lingerie are popular holiday gifts, anticipating demand surge (historical highs ~190 avg in P16-21 summer, but winter holidays likely similar/stronger). OR recommendation: 7 units (overly conservative, likely due to recent low mean pulling base-stock down, ignores seasonality and ignores actual spikes). Strategy: Override OR upward to 100 units - replenishes to starting inventory ~184 (covers ~3x recent avg or potential 150+ Black Friday peak), balances stockout risk vs holding (profit=holding=1, but endgame with 6 periods left prioritizes sales). Ensures coverage for (L+1)=1 period ahead plus buffer for surge. No new sustained regime shift (recent avg stable ~67, spikes not 3+ periods consistent).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 7 to 100 units - Black Friday (Nov 29) within Period 42 week and Christmas approaching likely to spike lingerie demand (recent spikes to 116 support), current 84 on-hand risks stockout if demand exceeds 100.",
