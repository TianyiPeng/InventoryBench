(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no expected arrivals this period. Must cover Period 1 demand post-decision. (e) Order logic: Order ~1 period's forecast (67) + safety buffer (10 for variance/possible Valentine's) =70 units. Balances stockout risk (lost $19/sale) vs holding ($1/period); quick adjustment possible with LT=0.",
