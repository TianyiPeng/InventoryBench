Volatile pattern post-peak mirrors prior (e.g., P22:113\u2192P23:38; P27:118\u2192P28:78). No sustained new regime (only 2 low periods); forecast P40 ~50 (recent trend extrapolation, conservative vs avg last5=92).\n(c) Lead time: Confirmed 0 periods for all 39 periods (every order arrives same period, e.g., P39: ordered=60 arrived=60 Period39). No missing/delayed orders; in-transit=0.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=77 (from P39 end), in-transit=0. Covers forecast 50 (1.5x safety); excess from P39 over-order (119 avail vs 42 demand). No overdue shipments.\n(e) Final order logic: Order 0; available=77 >> forecast 50 (recent 42/76<<77). Profit=holding=$1 balances at ~0 ending inv. Avoids adding to excess (P39 mistake repeated); EV[R] higher as prob(demand>77) low (~summer/post-peak drops to 40s). Lead=0 enables quick ramp-up if holiday rebound in P41+.",
