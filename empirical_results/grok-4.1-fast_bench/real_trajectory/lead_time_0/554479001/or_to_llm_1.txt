Demand analysis: Ozzy Denim Shorts (summer garment) in mid-November 2019 (Period 40, 2019/11/11) - post-summer peak decline sustained into late fall/winter (carry-over confirms P34-37 avg=13.5, very low \u03c3=3; P36-39:17,10,14,15 avg=14 stable low); no seasonal uplift expected (winter off-season for shorts, no holidays driving shorts demand). Full history skewed by summer peaks (e.g., P20=812), but recent 10 periods (P30-39) avg~18 declining to ~14. OR recommendation (183 units): Overestimates due to using full historical mean (inflated by peaks) and promised L=0 without recency/seasonality adjustment; its base-stock likely >> current needs. Strategy: Override to order 0 - preserve cash, minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) on ample inventory; expected demand ~10-15/period, 281 covers remaining ~8 periods (to 47) with buffer. No pipeline risk.",
