======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed as 0 periods consistently across all concluded periods (e.g., P46: ordered P46 arrived P46), matching promised and carry-over insights; no lost shipments or drifts. Inventory status: On-hand=114, in-transit=0, providing strong buffer for current period (arrivals happen before demand). Demand analysis: Current date 2019/12/30 (NYE week, post-Christmas); product is women's everyday trousers, likely moderate NYE demand but post-holiday normalization expected after peaks (P45=125 pre-Christmas, P46=92 Christmas week). Recent holiday volatility high (P42-P46: 36/47/12/125/92, avg~62, std~45; last 3 avg~76); low-season baseline ~11 (P35-P41), but holiday surge sustained per carry-over. OR recommendation=49 aligns with full-history empirical mean ~47 (diluted by pre-surge lows), using L=0, base-stock ~127 (mu=47, sigma~49, z=1.645 for q=0.95), order_raw~13 capped/adjusted to 49. Adjustment: Override upward to 80 as OR underweights recent holiday volatility/peaks (P45-P46 avg~109); target total inventory ~194 (114+80) covers expected demand ~90-120 + safety ~50 (1.645*~30 recent sigma), minimizing stockout risk (recent max 125) while limiting holding (projected end ~70-100, cost $1/unit low vs profit $19). Strategy: Scale OR ~1.6x for recency/holiday tail, conservative given post-peak risk but prioritizing sales.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 49 to 80 units - recent holiday demands P45-P46 averaged 108.5 with high volatility (up to 125), expect NYE week ~90-120 despite post-Christmas normalization; 114 on-hand provides buffer but OR underestimates recency.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand volatile sustained into late Dec P44-P46: 12/125/92 (avg 76.3 +570% vs P35-P39 low avg11.4), confirming extension of pre-Christmas surge with persistent highs/volatility (std~57 vs low-season ~3).",
