Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11), first decision with no prior period concludes or realized demands. Historical samples (5 weeks ending 2019/2/4): mean ~30.2, recent demand uptick to 48 but not sustained (only 1 period >35). Near Valentine's Day (Feb 14), minor potential fashion uplift for jeans but no strong evidence. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Defaults use promised L=0 and full historical mean/std for mu_hat=(1+0)*30.2~30, sigma_hat=std~11, yielding base_stock~30+1.645*11~48 to cover expected demand at q=19/20=0.95 service level while minimizing holding.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18): Mid-February, high-waisted skinny jeans. Recent demands show uptick: historical last three 32 (1/28), 48 (2/4), 48 (2/11, Period 1), avg ~42.7 vs prior avg ~25 (first 4). Possible demand regime shift starting ~2/4, regime length=2 (not yet 3+ sustained). Inventory: on-hand=1, in-transit=0; no overdue/missing shipments. Lead time confirmed 0 periods from Period 1 conclude. Use default L (promised 0, matches observed). mu_hat recent_3 to capture uptick (higher mean ~43 vs all ~33). sigma_hat recent_3 (lower recent volatility ~9 vs all). Higher mu/similar sigma raises base_stock for better service (q~0.95 high profit), covers expected ~43-48 demand, minimizes stockout while controlling holding via backend cap.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), late February, high-waisted skinny jeans (winter/early spring fashion). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Confirmed lead time=0 (both prior orders arrived same period). Demand: historical avg~30 (Jan-Feb early), but recent Period1(2/11):48, Period2(2/18):65 showing upward shift (+35% last period, possible seasonal increase or trend). No major calendar events immediate. Use recent_N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent higher mean/variance regime (mean=56.5, std~12); L=default (promised/observed=0). This boosts base_stock for higher service (q=19/20=0.95) to cover ~60 demand, minimizing stockouts vs low holding cost, while cap limits overorder.

Daily Reward (R_t): $883.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, jeans product with steady seasonal demand but recent game history shows elevated demands: P1:48, P2:65 (possible Valentine's spike), P3:48 (mean 53.7 vs historical mean ~30). On-hand=29 sufficient for ~0.5 periods at recent mean; in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all prior orders arrived LT=0). Lead time consistently 0 across P1-P3 concludes. Use default L=0 (promised/observed). mu_hat recent_3 to capture recent higher mean regime (53.7*(1+0)). sigma_hat recent_3 for volatility (std~8.2*sqrt(1+0)). This raises base_stock to ~53 + 1.645*8.2 ~70 (q=19/20=0.95), targeting order ~41 to cover demand post-29 on-hand while minimizing holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated in game periods: avg 53.7 vs historical ~30 (+77%), sustained over 3 periods with evidence from P1-P3 demands 48,65,48.

Daily Reward (R_t): $790.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Mid-March, no major holidays; jeans demand elevated regime continues (P1-P4 demands: 48,65,48,43; avg=51 vs historical ~30). On-hand=27, in-transit=0; all prior orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed x4). No overdue shipments. Changepoint at game start (P1): sustained high demand over 4 periods. Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated mean~51 and std~8.3; L=default (promised 0, matches all observed). Ensures OR base_stock targets ~51 + 1.645*8.3 \u224864 (high service q=19/20=0.95), covering 1-period demand post-decision while minimizing hold on 27 OH.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18, early spring); high-waisted skinny jeans demand elevated in game periods (P1-P5 avg 48 vs hist ~30) but softening recently (P3-P5: 48,43,36 avg 42.3, -25% vs P1-P2 avg 56.5). LT consistently 0 across 5 concluded periods (P1-P5 orders arrived same period), no in-transit or losses; on-hand 31 sufficient for ~1 period but order needed. Use recent_5 for mu_hat (48) and sigma_hat (~9.6) to capture sustained game regime vs default mu~39/all std~9.6; L default (0). Higher mu ensures high service (q=19/20) for profit maximization, safety stock ~16 covers vol, order ~33 to target base~64 balancing stockouts vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening post-P2 peak: P3-P5 avg 42.3 vs P1-P2 avg 56.5 (-25%), sustained over 3 periods with demands 48,43,36.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), late March, high-waisted skinny jeans. Demand softening confirmed post-Feb peak (P1-P2 avg 56.5), recent P3-P6 demands 48,43,36,42 avg 42.25 (down ~25% from peak), sustained over 4 periods aligning with carry-over insight. No major calendar events imminent (Easter April 21). Lead time consistently 0 across all 6 concluded periods (e.g., P6 order arrived P6). No in-transit or overdue shipments. On-hand 24 likely covers low-end demand but risks stockout at ~42 mean; recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat uses post-peak regime (length 4>3 min), informing (1+0)*42.25 mean and low recent std ~4.5 for base stock ~42 + 1.645*4.5 ~49, order ~25 after on-hand, balancing high profit (19) vs holding (1) via q=0.95 service.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1, early April, no major holidays; high-waisted skinny jeans demand typically steady but game history volatile). Demands P1-P7: 48,65,48,43,36,42,62 (avg 49.1, elevated vs historical ~30). Recent P7=62 spike caused stockout (sold 51/62, ending 0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; all prior orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0 consistently observed in P1-7 concludes, no losses). Carry-over notes initial elevation (P1-P3 avg53.7) and softening (P3-P5 avg42.3), but P6=42, P7=62 shows renewed volatility not yet sustained. Use default L=0 (matches all evidence). mu_hat recent_7 (N=7, game-period regime length>3, captures elevated mean~49 for (1+0)*49); sigma_hat recent_7 (recent volatility std~10.7 vs historical lower). High q=19/20=0.95 targets base_stock ~ mu + 1.64 sigma ~65 to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding on 0 inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early April pre-Easter (4/21/2019), potential mild uptick in spring apparel/jeans demand. Game demands: P1-8 avg 48.5 (elevated vs pre-game ~30), volatile. Carry-over: initial elevation P1-3 avg53.7, softening post-P2 peak P3-5 avg42.3 (-25%). Recent P6-8:42,62,44 avg49.3 (volatile continuation of post-peak regime). All LT=0 confirmed across P1-8 concludes, no in-transit or overdue shipments (all arrived same period as ordered). On-hand 23 low vs expected ~50 demand. No losses. Most recent changepoint: P6 softening regime, sustained length 3 periods (P6-8), so recent_N N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (mu~(49.3), sigma~11). L default (promised/observed 0). Parameters yield base_stock ~49 + 1.645*11 ~69 (q=19/20=0.95), order ~69-23=46 (capped higher), ensures coverage for volatile demand, high service vs low holding.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15, mid-spring): Steady seasonal demand expected for high-waisted skinny jeans, no major calendar events nearby. All historical lead times confirmed at 0 periods across P1-9 (no in-transit or losses). On-hand=15, pipeline=0; recent demand P7-9 (62,44,53 avg=53) risks stockout if ~50 unmet. Game demands P1-9 avg=49 (441 total), std~11.8 vs historical ~30/9.4; elevated regime since P1 sustained 9 periods (+63%). No new sustained changepoint (recent volatility not clearly shifted beyond prior softening). L=default (matches actual 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=9 to capture full elevated regime, informing backend base_stock~49+1.645*11.8~67 and cap~49+1.645*11.8/sqrt(1)~67, balancing high profit service vs holding (q=19/20=0.95).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter weekend (Easter 2019-04-21); high-waisted skinny jeans demand likely stable in late spring, no major seasonal spike expected. Game demands P1-P10 average 48.2 (elevated vs pre-game ~30, as per carry-over), recent P6-P10 avg 48.4, P8-P10 avg 46, with volatility (std ~8.9). All 10 observed lead times exactly 0 periods, no in-transit or losses. On-hand 24 may not cover expected ~45-50 demand this period. No new sustained changepoint (prior softening P3-P5 not continued; recent stable around 48). L='default' uses promised 0 (matches all history). mu_hat='recent_N' N=10 uses full game history mean 48.2*(1+0). sigma_hat='recent_N' N=10 uses game std 8.9*sqrt(1+0). Parameters target base_stock ~48 + 1.645*8.9 \u224865 (q=19/20=0.95), ensuring high service vs holding cost while adapting to elevated regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29, late April, no major holidays imminent; high-waisted skinny jeans demand stable-elevated in spring per game data). All 11 concluded periods confirm actual lead_time=0 (e.g., P11 order arrived P11), no drifts or losses; in-transit=0, on-hand=21 low vs expected ~48 demand (game mean=47.7 over P1-11: demands 48,65,48,43,36,42,62,44,53,41,43). No new changepoints (P7=62 spike isolated, not sustained 3+ periods; recent P8-11 avg=45.25 aligns with prior softening ~42). Use default L (promised=0 confirmed). recent_N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat weights full game regime (elevated mean~48, std~10.5 vs historical ~30/9.5), yielding base_stock~48 + 1.645*10.5~65; order~65-21=44 covers demand with high service (q=19/20=0.95) minimizing stockouts/holding.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6): Early May, high-waisted skinny jeans (denim trousers). No immediate major events (Mother's Day ~May 12 unlikely major driver). All 12 observed lead times confirmed as 0 periods, no losses or delays; on-hand=19 low, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Demands sustained elevated avg 47.4 over P1-12 (sum=569), vs historical ~30; recent P7-12 avg 47.8 (62,44,53,41,43,44), stable high regime length>=12 periods post early fluctuations (no new changepoint). Use recent_N=12 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to focus backend on current high-demand regime (ignores pre-game lows), L default=0. Ensures base_stock ~47 + 1.645*sigma covers demand post-L=0 + safety for q~0.95, OR orders ~base-19 to prevent stockout (profit=19>>holding=1), balance inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13, mid-May). Jeans demand showing softening trend per carry-over (post-P6 avg lower), with recent P8-P13 demands 44,53,41,43,44,23 (avg 41.3, std implied higher due to variance). P13=23 low possibly seasonal dip into summer (lighter clothing preference) or post-Mother's Day (5/12) effect, but single period not sustained. Overall game avg ~45.5, but recent regime (post-P6 softening + recent stability with dip) warrants recent_6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to lower forecast vs default (which includes early highs). L consistently 0 across all 13 periods, no losses/overdues (in-transit=0). On-hand=39 covers ~1 week recent demand; params target base_stock ~41 + 1.645*sigma (q=19/20=0.95) to balance service vs holding, reducing overstock risk amid dip.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20), late spring/early summer; high-waisted skinny jeans demand softening per carry-over (post-peak avg 42.3 P3-P5) and recent evidence (P13:23, P14:36 vs P10-P12 avg~42.7, -20-45% drop). No major calendar events immediate (Memorial Day 5/27 upcoming, minor impact expected for jeans). All 14 prior orders arrived with LT=0 (no losses/delays, in-transit=0 confirmed). On-hand=22 sufficient for low demand but order needed to cover ~37 expect. Changepoint: low demand regime from ~P13 (P10-P14: mean 37.4, regime length 5). Set L=default (promised 0, matches all history). mu_hat=recent_5 (37.4\xd7(1+0)), sigma_hat=recent_5 (std~8.6\xd7\u221a(1+0)) to adapt to softening/low-vol regime, targeting BS~37+1.645\xd78.6\u224851 (order~29), high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs low holding.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27), late May spring/summer transition; high-waisted skinny jeans demand likely softening as warmer weather reduces need (P13 low 23, then 36/39). On-hand 13, in-transit 0; all historical orders (P1-15) arrived with LT=0, no losses/overdues. Confirmed downward demand shift at P13: P13-P15 avg 32.7 vs P10-P12 avg 42.7 (-24%), sustained 3 periods\u2014regime_length=3 so N=3. L default (promised 0, all observed 0). mu_hat recent_3: (1+0)*32.7\u224833. sigma_hat recent_3: sqrt(1+0)*std\u22488.6 (low vol). Parameters target base_stock\u224833+1.645*8.6\u224847, order ~34 to cover demand post-13 on-hand, high service (q=0.95) vs low holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward at Period 13: avg 32.7 vs prior 42.7 (-24%), sustained over 3 periods with demands 23,36,39.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3, early June, start of summer; high-waisted skinny jeans demand likely steady, no major events imminent like World Cup June 14). LT consistently 0 across all 16 concluded periods (every order arrived same period, no losses or in-transit). On-hand=1 low, pipeline=1 total. Recent demands P12-16:44,23,36,39,46 (avg 37.6 vs overall ~44.6, std ~9); P13 low (23) noted in carry-over as downward shift sustained P13-15 (avg32.7), but P16=46 rebound (+41% vs regime). No new sustained changepoint (rebound only 1 period <3). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect moderated mean/volatility post-P13 shift (backend: mu=37.6, sigma~9); default L=0. Lowers base_stock vs default (~44.6+1.645*overall_std) to cut holding risk (recent lower mean), while q=19/20=0.95 high z~1.645 ensures ~51 order covers demand+ safety, balancing profit vs low hold cost $1.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10), early summer; high-waisted skinny jeans (fashion lower body garment), demand potentially variable with seasonal/fashion trends but no clear calendar spikes imminent. Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 17 concluded periods (every order arrived same period), no in-transit or losses, pipeline empty. On-hand 0 after P17 stockout (demand=69 > starting 53, lost ~16 sales). Demand history shows volatility: early peaks (P1-2 ~56 avg), softening (P3-5 ~42), spikes (P7=62, P17=69), downward shift at P13 (P13-15 avg 32.7 as per carry-over). Recent P13-17: 23,36,39,46,69 (avg 42.6, uptick in last 2 but not sustained). Most recent changepoint P13 downward (regime_length=5 periods P13-17), set N=5 for recent_N on mu_hat/sigma_hat to adapt OR to current mean/vol (mu~(1+0)*42.6, sigma~sqrt(1)*~17), yielding base_stock ~42.6 + 1.645*17 ~72 to cover spikes/service level while limiting hold cost; L default (confirmed 0).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/6/17, mid-June summer season). Jeans demand showing new upward regime shift: P16-P18 demands 46,69,66 (avg 60.3) vs P13-P15 23,36,39 (avg 32.7, +84% increase), sustained over 3 periods amid possible seasonal/trend factors for high-waisted skinny denim. All historical lead times confirmed at 0 periods (no drifts or losses, in-transit=0). On-hand=5 low, no pipeline gaps. Use L default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat recent_3 captures elevated mean ~60 over 1+L=1 period. sigma_hat recent_3 for matching volatility ~12. Ensures high base stock (~60 + 1.6*12 \u224880) for q=19/20=0.95 service level, prioritizing profit over low holding amid demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 16: avg 60.3 vs prior P13-P15 avg 32.7 (+84%), sustained over 3 periods with demands 46,69,66.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24, late June summer period). Demand regime remains elevated per carry-over Period 19 insight (upward shift at P16: P16-P19 demands 46,69,66,73 avg 63.5, +84% vs prior low). Sustained high over 4 periods, no new changepoint. Lead time consistently 0 across all 19 concluded periods, no in-transit or losses. On-hand 8 low vs expected ~63.5 demand; will order post-decision to cover P20. Product: high-waisted skinny jeans - recent data overrides seasonal summer dip expectation. Use L default (promised 0). mu_hat recent_4 captures regime mean 63.5*(1+0). sigma_hat recent_4 captures elevated vol ~12. Sets high base_stock ~63.5 + 1.645*12 \u224883 (q=19/20=0.95), orders ~75 to prioritize profit/service over low holding, given consistent LT=0.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1), early July summer start; jeans demand potentially softening in heat, confirmed by P20 demand=36 drop (-51% from P19=73), echoing past post-peak softens (e.g., P6 insight). Carry-over upward regime at P16 (46,69,66; avg60.3) extended to P19=73 (regime avg~63), but P20 break suggests emerging softening though not yet sustained 3+ periods. Overall game demands avg47.85 (P1-20), recent_5 (P16-20:46,69,66,73,36; avg58, std~16.1) captures elevated volatile regime. Lead time consistently 0 across all 20 observed periods (no in-transit/overdues). On-hand=48 covers low demand risk but orders needed for service. L=default (promised=0 matches reality). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_5 weights recent regime (N=5=regime length), yielding base_stock~58+1.645*16.1~84; order~36 (after -48 pipeline), high q=0.95 prioritizes profit vs low holding.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22, date 2019/7/8 (early summer, post-July 4 Independence Day). Jeans demand volatile but elevated recently: P16-21 demands 46,69,66,73,36,77 (avg 61.2, sustained high vs prior regimes per carry-over). On-hand 8 (low), in-transit 0 (no overdue/missing; all 21 prior orders arrived same period, lead_time=0 confirmed). No changepoint in lead time. Use L default (promised 0). mu_hat recent_N=6 for upward regime since P16 (length=6>=3, avg~61 covers expected demand). sigma_hat recent_N=6 captures high volatility (swings incl. P20 dip). Parameters elevate base_stock=mu+z*sigma (z~1.645 for q=19/20=0.95) to ensure high fill-rate/service despite low inventory, balancing profit capture vs low holding; cap prevents excess.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15, mid-summer). Jeans demand volatile in recent summer periods, with carry-over upward regime since P16 (demands 46,69,66,73,36,77,53; avg~60 vs prior low ~33). P20 dip to 36 appears anomalous amid sustained highs; last 3 (36,77,53 avg55) volatile but no new sustained shift. Lead time consistently 0 across all 22 periods (no in-transit or losses). On-hand 36 sufficient for low demand but risks stockout on high (~60-77). Use recent_7 (regime length 7 since P16 changepoint) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target elevated mean/vol in (1+0)=1 period, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding; default L=0 as confirmed.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22, late July summer). High-waisted skinny jeans; demand volatile in summer with recent highs. Lead time consistently 0 over 23 periods (all 'lead_time was 0 periods'), no in-transit or losses; on-hand 33 low vs recent ~60 demand. Demand regime shift upward at P16 sustained (P16-P23: 46,69,66,73,36,77,53,53; avg 59.1, regime length 8 periods, P20 dip not sustained as P21-P23 avg 61). Changepoint evidence from carry-over and data. Use recent_N N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated mean/vol (mu~(1+0)*59.1=59.1, sigma~sqrt(1)*16.7); default L=0. Backend base_stock~59+1.645*17~87, orders ~54 to cover demand, high q=19/20=0.95 favors stock vs holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29, late July summer, potential end-of-season jeans demand variability). All 24 historical periods confirm lead_time=0 consistently, no in-transit or losses; on-hand=56 covers 1+ periods of demand (~50). Recent demands P20-P24: 36,77,53,53,27 (mean=49.2, std\u224819.0); volatile but avg aligns with elevated regime from carry-over P16 upward shift, though P24=27 suggests possible softening (not yet sustained 3+ periods). Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect current regime/volatility (N=5 as regime_length>5 post-P16 changepoint, capped reasonably); L=default (promised=0 matches all evidence). Backend: mu_hat=49.2, sigma_hat\u224819.0, q=19/20=0.95 (z\u22481.645), base_stock\u224849+31=80; order\u224880-56=24 (low to minimize holding on high inventory, high service). No overdue shipments.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5, early August, end of summer for high-waisted skinny jeans; back-to-school season approaching late Aug but no sustained demand shift yet). Lead time consistently 0 across all 25 periods (no in-transit, no losses). On-hand 27 low vs recent demand ~55, risk of stockout. Recent demand regime from P16 upward shift (carry-over P19: avg 60.3 P16-18, continued volatile high avg 55.4 P16-25), regime_length=10 periods sustained high mean/variance vs earlier ~45 overall. Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated volatile regime (mu_hat=1*55.4, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*~22), overriding lower historical prior (~30). L=default (0 confirmed). High profit/holding q~0.95 favors safety stock; params boost base_stock ~55+1.645*22~93, order ~93-27=66 to cover demand + buffer, minimizing lost sales.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12), late summer; skinny high-waisted jeans (fashion lower body garment). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Lead time consistently 0 across all 26 concluded periods (every order arrived same period). Recent demand elevated and volatile post-P16 regime shift (carry-over Period 19: avg 60.3 P16-P18, extended P16-P26 avg~58, last 10 P17-P26:69,66,73,36,77,53,53,27,54,83 avg=59.1). P26 demand=83 caused ending inv=0 (no stockout loss). Use default L=0 (matches observed). mu_hat recent_10 captures sustained elevated regime (N=10 as regime_length~11, min(11,20)=11 but cap to 10 for recency). sigma_hat recent_10 for high recent volatility (std~19). Ensures base_stock ~59 + 1.645*19 ~95 (q=19/20=0.95), balances high service vs holding; OR cap irrelevant with L=0.

All 27 observed lead times=0 (consistent). Demands show new upward regime P25-27:54,83,96 avg=77.7 vs P22-24:53,53,27 avg=44.3 (+76% shift at P25, sustained 3 periods). Use recent_N=3 (regime_length=3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target ~78 mean + high safety (~1.645*~17.6 std \u2192 base_stock ~106, covers recent highs like 96 while limiting excess hold). L=default (promised 0 confirmed). Balances high service (q=0.95) vs holding amid volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand regime shift upward at Period 25: avg 77.7 vs prior P22-P24 avg 44.3 (+76%), sustained over 3 periods with demands 54,83,96.

Recent demands P25-P30: 54,83,96,103,97,94 (avg 87.8, std ~17.7), confirming carry-over high regime shift from P25 (now 6 periods sustained, +76% vs prior). All historical lead times=0 (no in-transit, no losses, every order arrived same period). On-hand=25 low vs expected ~90 demand, risks stockout. Pipeline=0.

Recent high demand regime sustained from P25 changepoint (carry-over evidence): P25-P31 demands 54,83,96,103,97,94,67 (avg 85, +76% vs prior P22-P24 avg44), now 7 periods. P31=67 is a single dip (-29% from P30), insufficient for new sustained shift (needs 3+ periods). Lead time consistently 0 across all 31 periods, no in-transit/ losses/ overdues. On-hand=51 covers expected demand. L= default (promised 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat= recent_7 to anchor on current high regime mean/vol for (1+0) period, yielding high base_stock (q=19/20=0.95 implies z*~1.64) to capture sales (profit=19>>holding=1) while capping overstock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23, late September - early fall transition for high-waisted skinny jeans; potential steady demand post-back-to-school/summer peaks). All historical lead times confirmed as 0 periods across 32 periods, no losses or drifts, in-transit=0, on-hand=52 aligns with expected arrivals (P32 order=64 arrived in P32). Recent demand regime high since P25 changepoint (carry-over confirmed sustained through P30 avg98, total 6+ periods), P25-P32 demands:54,83,96,103,97,94,67,63 (avg82.1, regime_length=8). Softening in P31-P32 (67,63 avg65, -30% from P30=94) but only 2 periods - not sustained (needs 3+), so no new downward changepoint. Use recent_8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high regime mean/vol while incorporating latest softening; L=default (promised=0 confirmed). This sets base_stock ~82 + 1.645*sigma (q=19/20=0.95), balancing high service vs holding on expected ~82 demand over 1 period, preventing stockouts like P27/P32 while avoiding excess hold on 52 on-hand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): Approaching fall, potential seasonal uptick for high-waisted jeans as weather cools; recent demand sustained high per carry-over (P25+ regime avg ~85-98). P25-P33 demands (54,83,96,103,97,94,67,63,110) avg 85.2 (+ vs historical ~30), regime length 9 periods (changepoint P25 upward +76% per carry-over, sustained incl P33=110 spike negating P31-32 dip). On-hand=3 low, in-transit=0, no overdue/losses (all 33 periods L=0 confirmed). L=default (promised=0 matches all history). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_9 to target elevated mean/vol in current regime, boosting base_stock for high profit q=19/20=0.95 service while capping overstock; covers expected ~85+ demand post low ending inv.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35, date 2019/10/7 (early October, fall season start; jeans demand likely sustained/elevated for cooler weather and fashion). On-hand=15 low, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments\u2014all 34 prior periods confirm actual LT=0 (consistent with promised). Recent demands volatile but elevated: P33=110, P34=103 (high), after dip P31=67/P32=63, within carry-over high regime from P25 (length=10 periods P25-P34, avg~87). No new sustained changepoint (P33-P34 high +43% vs P29-P32 avg~80 but only 2 periods). Use default L=0 (matches all observed). mu_hat recent_10 (regime P25-P34 length=10, backend (1+0)*mean~87). sigma_hat recent_10 (captures vol ~20-25). Balances high service (q=0.95, base_stock~87+1.65*22~143) vs holding: order~143-15=128 covers ~100 demand + safety, prioritizes profit from sales.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Mid-October, fall season for high-waisted skinny jeans; potential steady/elevated demand as weather cools, no immediate holidays but Halloween end-Oct may influence apparel. Recent demands P26-P35 (10 periods): avg 88.3 (high regime per carry-over from P25, sustained 11 periods P25-P35 avg~85), volatile with highs 96-110 and dips to 63-67. On-hand 52, in-transit 0; covers ~0.5-1 period at recent levels. Lead time consistently 0 across all 35 periods, no losses/overdues. Use L 'default' (promised 0). mu_hat 'recent_N' N=10 to capture sustained high mean*1=88.3. sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=10 for recent volatility ~16, sqrt(1)*std. Raises base_stock to ~88 + 1.645*16 \u2248120 (q=19/20=0.95), ensures coverage post-current demand despite no pipeline, minimizes stockouts (high profit) while capping limits overstock (low holding).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21), late October fall season for high-waisted skinny jeans; demand volatile with recent high regime from P25 per carry-over (P25-P36 avg ~83), last 10 periods (P27-P36) avg 85.5 (demands:96,103,97,94,67,63,110,103,67,55), std high reflecting volatility. Lead time consistently 0 across all 36 periods, no in-transit or losses; on-hand 62 sufficient for ~1 period but risks stockout on high demand days. L=default (promised 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_10 to focus on current high-volatile regime (regime length ~12 from P25, N=10 conservative cap), yielding mu_hat~85.5, sigma_hat=std~19; OR backend sets base_stock~85.5 + 1.645*19~110 (q=19/20=0.95), order~110-62=48 to cover 1+L=1 period demand, high service vs low holding.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Late October, pre-Halloween and approaching Black Friday (Nov 29), apparel like high-waisted skinny jeans likely sustains high fall demand. On-hand 29 low, in-transit 0, all historical arrivals confirmed lead_time=0 (no losses/delays). Recent demands P28-P37: 103,97,94,67,63,110,103,67,55,90 (avg~85, std high ~19), consistent with sustained high regime from P25 (carry-over: avg 77-98). No new changepoint; P35-37 (67,55,90 avg~71) volatile but not sustained drop. Use recent_10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on high recent mean/vol *(1+0), avoiding pull-down by early low demands. L default (promised=0, always observed). High profit/holding ratio favors aggressive base_stock ~85 + safety to cover demand, minimize stockouts vs holding.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25), pre-Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29) week; apparel like high-waisted skinny jeans likely to see holiday shopping demand spike, similar to prior peaks (e.g., P26-30 avg~95, P33-34 ~106). Recent demands low P38-P41:46,32,45,25 avg37 (downward shift vs P30-P37 avg81), but calendar event overrides pure recency for proactive stocking.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2, Cyber Monday) - major e-commerce peak post-Black Friday (P42 2019/11/25 demand=67 already +81% vs P38-P41 low regime avg37). Jeans (high-waisted skinny denim) likely see holiday shopping/gifting spike, akin to prior peaks P26-P30/P33-P34 avg~95-105. On-hand=61, in-transit=0, all historical orders arrived same-period (L=0 confirmed, no losses/overdues). Prior downward regime (carry-over P42) interrupted by P42 uptick + calendar drivers warrant explicit forecast adjustment. L=default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat=explicit 80 ((1+0)*80 weekly forecast blending recent uptick/holiday precedent). sigma_hat=explicit 30 (recent 10-period std~29, conservative vol for peak). Yields base_stock~80+1.645*30~129 (order~68), prioritizing service (q=0.95) for high-profit peak demand vs minor holding risk.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), approaching Christmas (Dec 25 ~P46); jeans may see holiday demand spike, but no evidence yet\u2014recent P38-P43 demands 46,32,45,25,67,21 avg 39.3 (down 52% from prior P30-P37 avg 81), sd~17 confirming carry-over P42 downward regime (now 6 periods). On-hand 109 covers ~3 periods at current mean, in-transit 0, lead times consistently 0 (all arrives same period, no losses). Use recent_N=6 (regime length 6>=3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low mean/high vol over 1+L=1 period; L default. Yields base~39+1.645*17~66<<109 so order~0, minimizing holding ($1) vs profit($19) while buffering vol; on-hand protects if holiday spike hits.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), pre-Christmas holiday period for high-waisted skinny jeans (trousers category, potential gift demand). Recent demands P38-P44: 46,32,45,25,67,21,28 (avg 37.7, std ~16), confirming sustained downward regime shift noted in carry-over Period 42 (from prior ~81 avg, -54%). No holiday spike evident yet (P43:21, P44:28 low post-P42 67 outlier). On-hand 81 high vs recent ~38 mean, in-transit 0, no overdue shipments (all historical lead times=0). Use L default (promised 0, consistently observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 (regime_length=7 from P38 changepoint, N=max(min(7,20),3)=7) to track low mean/high vol regime, yielding base_stock ~38 + 1.645*16 ~65 (on-hand 81 > base, likely order 0, minimizes holding while high q=19/20=0.95 service buffers stockouts).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23), Christmas shopping week (Dec 23-29), expect demand spike for high-waisted skinny jeans due to holiday retail surge, similar to Thanksgiving P42 demand=67 (vs P41=25, +168%). Recent demands low: P43-45 avg=23 (21,28,19), P38-45 avg=35 std~16, sustained low regime from P38 but calendar event overrides for proactive forecast. On-hand=62 covers ~2-3 low-demand periods but risks stockout (lost profit $19/unit) if spike to 60-80; no in-transit, lead time consistently 0 over 45 periods (no losses/overdues). Use default L=0. mu_hat explicit=70 (1+L)*forecast ~70, anticipating uplift from recent 35. sigma_hat explicit=25 for spike volatility. Raises base_stock ~70 + 1.645*25 \u2248 101 (q=19/20=0.95), order ~39 to boost service level vs low holding $1/unit, maximizing R_t.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward at Period 43: avg 23 vs prior P38-P42 avg 43 (-47%), sustained over 3 periods with demands 21,28,19.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30), post-Christmas (P46 12/23 demand=16 low), end-of-year slowdown for high-waisted skinny jeans. Demand regime remains low since changepoint at P43: sustained 4 periods (P43-46 demands 21,28,19,16; avg=21, -47% vs prior avg43), confirmed by carry-over. On-hand=96 high vs ~20 demand/period; in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Lead time consistently 0 across all 46 periods. Set L=default (promised/actual=0). mu_hat=recent_N N=4 captures low mean=21*(1+0). sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 for low volatility (std~5). Ensures base_stock ~21 + 1.645*5 ~30, low order-up-to vs high inventory minimizes holding cost ($1/unit) while covering service (q=19/20=0.95); OR cap also low.
