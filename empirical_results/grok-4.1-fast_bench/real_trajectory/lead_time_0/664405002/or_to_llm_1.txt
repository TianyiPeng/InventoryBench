Product is women's accessory belt (Virgo Hip belt) - relevant for holiday outfits/gifts/parties.

Low regime earlier (summer/fall ~70), but holiday context warrants expecting rebound/spike in P45-P47 (Christmas week). OR rec=0: Conservative, likely due to full-history mean diluted by long low-demand periods (~100 overall?), base-stock exceeded by OH=229.
