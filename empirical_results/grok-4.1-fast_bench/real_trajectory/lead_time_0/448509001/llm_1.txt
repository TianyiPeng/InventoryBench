No regime shift yet (small sample, increasing trend tentative). Forecast Period 1: 140 (recent avg +10% Valentine's buffer). (c) Lead time: Promised 0; no conclude msgs yet to infer actual. No missing orders. (d) Inventory: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; fully exposed to stockout this period. Pipeline empty. (e) Order logic: Order 150 (=forecast 140 + safety ~10=1sd) to achieve high fill rate (profit 19>>holding 1); lead=0 enables same-period coverage, excess rolls to next at low cost vs lost sales.
