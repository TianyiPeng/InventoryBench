{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed 0 periods consistently (latest P46 order arrived in P46). Current inventory: On-hand=181, in-transit=0, sufficient for 1+ periods even at recent demand levels (~120-170). Demand analysis: Holiday surge confirmed through P45 (P43-P45 avg=147), P46=123 shows post-Christmas dip but still elevated vs pre-holiday lows (~80 in Nov); 2019-12-30 (New Year's Eve week) likely sees continued moderate holiday/post-Xmas sales for jeans before Jan normalization/decline, forecast ~110-140 based on recent volatility (108,163,169,123). OR rec=36 uses full history (diluted by summer troughs ~30-90), underestimates recent regime (high service q=19/20=0.95 requires safety). Pipeline: None overdue/lost. Strategy: Override OR upwards to 110 units - replenishes conservatively to ~ base stock ~140-150 (recent mean + safety), covering expected demand + buffer without excess holding (projected ending inv ~70-90 post-demand). High on-hand buffers stockout risk given L=0.",
