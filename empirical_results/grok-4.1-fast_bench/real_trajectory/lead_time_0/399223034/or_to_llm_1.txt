P17 98 is massive outlier/stockout (sold only 15/98). Calendar: 2019-06-10 (early summer Monday); jeggings (stretch denim trousers, ladies casual) likely seeing seasonal pickup for summer casual wear, post-Memorial Day (P16). No major holidays, but trend from P15-P17 suggests regime shift upward. OR rec=30: Uses full history (empirical mean skewed low by long decline), promised LT=0, unweighted/no recency/seasonality adjustment - underestimates recent volatility/spike. Strategy: Override upward to 40 (33% > OR) for high service (q=4/(4+1)=0.8); covers ~P17 level conservatively while LT=0 minimizes holding risk (excess rolls to next).

No lost shipments or drifts. Inventory status: On-hand=130, in-transit=0; ample for current period since arrivals happen after decision but before demand. Demand analysis: Recent holiday regime stable high, P43-P46 avg=125 (122,130,126,122, \u03c3\u22484, low vol), +133% vs pre-P42 avg~54; post-Christmas (12/30) may see slight moderation but no decline signal in carry-overs or history\u2014continuation likely ~120-130. Product (jeggings, ladies denim trousers): Casual wear sustains moderate post-holiday demand into New Year's without sharp drop expected. OR recommendation: 0 units, using full history (diluted by early lows, \u03bc low) and promised L=0; base-stock exceeded by current 130 vs their low \u03bc\u0302, but aligns with our recent forecast (130 covers ~125 demand, expected end-inv ~5, holding cost minimal $1 vs lost sales risk $4). Strategy: Follow OR's 0\u2014no override needed as inventory buffers recent stable demand; avoids excess holding while minimizing stockout risk (recent max=130). Covers (L+1)=1 period demand proactively.",
