Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11), first decision with no prior game history or conclude messages. Valentine's Day (Feb 14) upcoming, potentially boosting demand for necklace accessory, but historical weekly demands (46,33,53,37,21; mean=38, std~11) show recent drop to 21. No changepoints or lead time observations. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Use defaults: backend applies promised L=0, mu_hat=(1+0)*38=38, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*11~11, balancing service (q=0.5) vs holding with historical stats for stable initialization.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18), post-Valentine's Day (Feb 14). Necklace accessory may have seasonal relevance around holidays, but Period 1 demand=26 was moderate (not spiked). On-hand=12 (low), in-transit=0; Period 1 order=38 arrived same period (LT=0 confirmed, no losses). Demand history: early periods (1/7:46,1/14:33,1/21:53) avg~44 high variance; recent 3 (1/28:37,2/4:21,2/11:26) avg=28 (-36%), lower variance. Chngpt at late Jan/early Feb (regime length=3+), so recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat adapts to lower mean/vol, lowering base stock to ~28 (q=0.5 \u2192 median focus) vs default~38, reduces holding risk while covering expected demand (order ~16 to reach ~28). L=default (promised/confirmed 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift late Jan/early Feb: avg from ~44 (first 3 periods) to 28 (last 3:37,21,26; -36%); Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1: ordered P1 arrived P1)

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), late Feb, women's necklace accessory; post-Valentine's, no major upcoming events, winter season winding down. Demand remains in low regime per carry-over: recent 4 samples (P2:23, P1:26, hist 02/04:21, 01/28:37) avg 26.75 (-~38% vs early ~44). On-hand=5 low, in-transit=0, no overdue (both prior orders arrived same period, LT=0 confirmed). L=0 so cover 1 period demand ~27. Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to lower base_stock mean/volatility matching sustained low demand regime (N=4: regime_length=4>3), default L (promised=0 observed consistently). Balances service (q=0.5) vs holding by reducing overstock risk on low demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4, early March, post-Valentine's Day). Necklace accessory demand in declining regime: game demands P1:26, P2:23, P3:14 (avg 21, down from initial historical avg 38 and noted shift to ~28). Last 3 periods confirm sustained low demand (changelength>=3, recent mean 21 vs prior 38, -45%). Lead time consistently 0 periods across P1-P3 concludes (no drifts or losses, in-transit=0). On-hand=13 sufficient for low expected demand ~20; parameters use recent_3 for mu/sigma to track low regime (mu_hat~(1+0)*21=21, sigma_hat~sqrt(1)*6.2), default L=0. This sets base_stock~21 (z=0 since q=0.5), orders to replenish to low level matching regime while minimizing holding (on-hand covers 1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Women's necklace accessory, post-Valentine (Feb14) period with sharp demand drop-off into early March; no major holidays imminent (St. Patrick's Mar17 unlikely driver for necklace). Demands: P1:26, P2:23, P3:14, P4:4 (further drop from prior noted shift to ~28 avg; recent avg P2-P4=13.67, -40% from prior regime). On-hand=17 sufficient for low recent demand (~4-14), no in-transit, all prior orders arrived LT=0 as expected. Changepoint evidence: sustained low since P3 (3 periods:23/14/4, but trending down). L=default (confirmed 0 across 4 periods). mu_hat=recent_N N=3 capturing recent low regime (backend:1x mean~13.7). sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 for low recent volatility (backend:1x std~8.1). Low params minimize overstock/holding vs profit given q=0.5, cover (L+1)=1 period low demand while observing if drop persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand further declined late Feb/early Mar: avg P3-P5 history shows 14,4 (extrapolating low; -60% from prior 28 avg regime, sustained 2+ periods)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18), mid-March, no major holidays or seasonal peaks for women's necklace accessories; demand in sustained low regime per carry-over (P3-P5: 14,4,12 avg~10, -60% from prior). Lead time confirmed 0 periods across all 5 prior periods (each 'arrived=ordered on same Period, lead_time=0'). On-hand=5, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Recent changepoint at P3: demand drop sustained 3 periods (regime_length=3, N=3). Use default L=0 (promised/confirmed). mu_hat recent_3 for low mean~(1+0)*10=10. sigma_hat recent_3 for current low volatility. Parameters target base_stock near recent mean (q=0.5 conservative), order to cover ~10 demand minus pipeline/on-hand, minimizing holding on low demand while avoiding stockouts.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), late March, no major holidays or seasonal spikes for women's necklace accessories; steady low demand post-decline. History demands: P1:26, P2:23, P3:14, P4:4, P5:12, P6:10 (recent_4 avg=10, confirming sustained low regime ~10 from carry-over Period 5 insight). All lead times confirmed 0 periods (P1-P6). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments. Use L default (promised=0, matches all observed). mu_hat recent_4 (regime_length=4 since P3 decline, N=4>=3) for low mean~10 across 1+L=1 period. sigma_hat recent_4 for volatility~4.3. With profit=holding=1 (q=0.5), base_stock~mu (low to minimize holding on excess); parameters ensure order~10, balancing sales vs. inv costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1), early April approaching Easter (4/21) - potential seasonal uptick for women's necklace accessories. P7 demand spiked to 47 (major stockout, lost ~37 sales/profit after selling 10), vs prior low regime avg ~9 (P4-P6:4,12,10). Possible changepoint at P7 signaling demand increase (+422% vs prior avg), though single period. Lead time consistently 0 across all 6 observed orders (P1-P4,P6-P7), no in-transit/overdue, on-hand=0 so pipeline=0. Use L default (confirmed 0). mu_hat recent_N=3 (P5-P7:12,10,47 mean=23; regime_length=1 but N=max(min(1,20),3)=3 per guideline, weights recent spike). sigma_hat recent_N=7 (all game history captures high volatility sd~14; recent regime volatile). This raises base_stock~23 (z=0,q=0.5) above prior low forecasts to cover spike risk, minimizing future stockouts (profit loss) while limiting overstock (holding cost), backend cap safely above via sigma.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early April approaching Easter (Apr 21), women's necklace/accessories may see spring/holiday demand uptick. Demand history: early steady 20s (P1-2), decline to avg~10 (P3-6), sharp sustained spike P7:47/P8:42 (300%+ from prior regime, stockouts both periods: sold<demand). Confirmed changepoint post-P6, regime length=2 but using recent_3 (P6-8 mean=33, std~16.4) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture emerging high mean/vol while smoothing one low obs; scales to (1+0)=33 mu. L default=0 confirmed consistently (all 8 orders arrived same period). No pipeline/on-hand=0 risks stockout; params raise base_stock ~mu +0*sigma (q=0.5,z=0) to ~33 vs default~22, balancing profit/holding while hedging vol/spike for higher service.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), spring season nearing Easter (Apr 21), likely boosting demand for women's necklace accessories. Demand history shows early decline (per carry-over: late Jan/Feb ~28 avg, late Feb/Mar early ~8 avg P4-P6:4,12,10), but clear regime shift upward at P7 with sustained high demand P7-P9:47,42,28 (avg 39, +325% from prior ~8; 3 periods evidence). Recent mean 39 fits seasonal spring/Easter uptick. On-hand 5, in-transit 0; all past orders arrived same period (LT=0 confirmed consistently, no losses). Use L default (promised 0). mu_hat recent_3 captures new high-demand regime: (1+0)*39=39. sigma_hat recent_3 for matching volatility (~10). With q=0.5 (z=0), base_stock\u224839 targets expected demand; recent params prevent stockout vs holding excess amid shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg increased from ~9 (P4-P6:4,12,10) to 39 (P7-P9:47,42,28; +333%), sustained 3 periods with spring/Easter context

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter (4/21/2019). Demand spiked in spring/Easter regime P7-P10: 47,42,28,21 (avg 34.5, sustained 4 periods per carry-over confirmation at P7-P9 + P10). P10=21 slight drop but not sustained (1 period <3+), so maintain recent regime. Accessory necklace aligns with spring fashion/Easter demand. On-hand=18, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all historical orders arrived same period, lead_time=0 confirmed consistently). No pipeline gaps. Parameters use recent_N=4 (regime length=4 since P7 changepoint) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated mean/volatility *(1+L=1); L=default (promised=0, matches all observed). Ensures base_stock ~34.5 covers expected demand, balancing stockouts (profit=1) vs holding=1 with on-hand buffer.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29), post-Easter (April 21) for women's necklace accessory; spring demand spike confirmed at P7 (avg P7-P9 ~39, +333% from prior ~9), but declining post-peak: P10:21, P11:15 (further -24% from P9:28). Recent 5 periods (P7-P11:47,42,28,21,15; avg=30.6, sustained spring regime length=5, no new changepoint yet as decline only 2 periods). All historical LT=0 confirmed (no in-transit, no losses). On-hand=20 covers ~1-2 weeks demand at ~15-20 recent levels. Use L=default (promised 0, matches all observed). mu_hat recent_5 (30.6 across 1+L=1 period) and sigma_hat recent_5 capture ongoing spring volatility post-spike without overreacting to short decline. Ensures base_stock ~mu (z=0 given p=h=1) balances service vs holding; cap irrelevant with L=0.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6, early May, post-Easter decline continuing; Mother's Day May 12 upcoming but no evidence of spike yet in necklace demand). Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 12 periods, no in-transit or losses; on-hand=22 sufficient for recent low demand. Demand history shows sustained post-Easter decline P10-P12:21,15,9 (avg=15, -62% from prior P7-P9 avg=39), changepoint at P10 confirmed by 3 periods of lower mean/variance vs. spring peak (Easter context). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture this regime (backend: mu_hat=(1+0)*15=15, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*~6); L=default (promised 0 matches actual). This lowers base_stock vs. default all-history mean~21 (high variance from peaks), reduces overstock risk (holding=profit=1), balances service for low-demand regime while on-hand covers multiple periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-Easter at Period 10: avg declined from 39 (P7-P9:47,42,28) to 15 (P10-P12:21,15,9; -62%), sustained 3 periods

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13), immediately post-Mother's Day (May 12, 2019), a key gifting event for women's necklace/accessories likely driving demand (suitable gift item). Recent demand: P10=21, P11=15, P12=9 (post-Easter low regime avg~15, per carry-over), but P13=28 (+211% from P12, pre-holiday buildup?). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical orders arrived same period, LT=0 confirmed). Most recent changepoint at P10 (decline sustained 3 periods P10-12), now regime length=4 (P10-P13). Use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat: demands [21,15,9,28] avg~18.25, std~8.1; mu_hat=18.25 (1+L=1), balances recent low+uptick vs prior high Easter. L=default (promised/confirmed 0). With q=0.5 (z~0), base_stock~mu_hat, orders ~18 (low risk stockout vs holding=profit). Cap~31 provides buffer. Addresses zero pipeline by targeting recent expected demand.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20), post-Mother's Day (May 12 in P14, demand spiked to 69). Women's necklace accessory demand typically event-driven; expect post-holiday decline similar to post-Easter drop (P10-12 avg~15). Full history mean~25, but recent 5 periods (P10-14: 21,15,9,28,69; avg=28.4, std~25.7) better reflects volatile spring regime incl. holiday uptick without overreacting to single spike. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no losses/overdues\u2014all 14 orders arrived with L=0. Parameters use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (1+L scaling with L=0), default L=0: enables backend base_stock~28 + 0*z*26 (q=0.5), orders ~28-40 to cover demand while minimizing hold costs given p=h=1.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27: Memorial Day holiday, major US retail event boosting summer accessory demand like necklaces). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline coverage. Lead time consistently 0 across all 13 observed orders (P1-P15 where ordered>0). Recent demand surge P13-P15:28,69,136 (avg=77.7, std\u224854.6), +420% from prior post-Easter low avg=15 (P10-P12), sustained 3 periods with late May calendar driver (Memorial Day). No prior conclude shows lead drift/losses. Use default L=0 (confirmed). recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture new high-demand/volatility regime, ensuring base_stock targets ~78 mean + balanced safety stock for profit=holding=1 (q=0.5). This proactively stocks for post-spike demand while minimizing excess hold via backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg increased from 15 (P10-P12:21,15,9) to 78 (P13-P15:28,69,136; +420%), sustained 3 periods with late May Memorial Day context

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3): Early June, post-Memorial Day (P16:5/27). High demand regime since P13 shift (avg 78 for P13-15, P16=130 sustains at ~91 avg over P13-16:28,69,136,130), +420% from prior post-Easter low; women's necklace/accessories likely summer demand continuation. No in-transit/on-hand=0, all prior orders arrived LT=0 (consistent). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/vol (1+L=1 period forecast ~91 mean, high std~48); L=default=0. This boosts base_stock~91 (q=0.5,z=0 so mu-driven) to cover demand/service while capping overstock risk vs holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10, early summer). Women's necklace demand remains in high regime post-Memorial Day (noted in carry-over P16 insight): P13-17 demands 28,69,136,130,115 (avg 95.6, sustained 5 periods, last 4 avg 112.5). High summer accessories demand expected to continue. Lead time confirmed 0 across all 17 periods (every order arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no losses/overdues; prior P17 order=91 insufficient for demand=115 (stockout). Use default L=0. mu_hat recent_5 captures elevated mean~96 for (1+0) periods. sigma_hat recent_5 for high vol (std~42). Ensures base_stock ~96 targets service amid profit=holding=1 balance, avoiding overstock while covering ~100 demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/6/17 mid-June summer). Women's necklace demand in sustained high summer regime since P14 (P14-P18 demands:69,136,130,115,102; mean=110.4, std~27; +420%+ from prior post-Easter low). No stockouts avoided recently due to underordering vs high demand; ending inventory consistently 0. All historical arrivals confirm lead_time=0 (no in-transit, no losses). Pipeline=0 (on-hand=0 + in-transit=0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current high mean/vol regime (regime_length=5, N=max(min(5,20),3)=5).

Backend base_stock=110.4 + 0*27=110.4 (q=0.5,z=0); order~110 (uncapped since cap>base_stock), covers expected demand median while minimizing hold risk.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24, late June, approaching July 4th). Flirty Linnea necklace (women's accessory); post-Memorial Day peak (P16 high demand sustained P14-P18 ~110 avg), sharp drop to 43 in P19 (-58%, possibly seasonal cooldown or holiday lull onset), but single period - not sustained shift (needs 3+ periods). Lead time consistently 0 across all 17 observed orders (no losses/delays, in-transit=0). On-hand=68 covers likely demand ~50-100. Recent regime high/volatility (chgpnt ~P13/P16 per carry-over, length~7 periods P13-P19); use recent_N=5 (P15-P19:136,130,115,102,43; mean~105, high std~38) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target recent patterns. L=default (promised/observed 0). Backend: base_stock~105 (z=0,q=0.5), order~37 (105-68), cap generous via sigma; covers demand, minimizes excess holding vs stockout.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demands P16-P20: 130,115,102,43,48 (mean 87.6, sustained high-to-drop pattern); new low regime at P19 (43,48 avg 45.5, -57% from prior P14-P18 ~110 avg) but only 2 periods, not yet sustained 3+. Lead time confirmed 0 across all 20 periods, no in-transit or losses. On-hand 58 (from P20 ending), in-transit 0. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to balance recent mean 87.6 and vol ~35.5, yielding base_stock~88 (z=0); order ~30 to cover holiday upside (~100+) vs low (~45), minimizing stockout risk (underage cost=1+holding saved=2) while co=1; cap ample.

Recent demands P19-P21:43,48,60 (avg 50.3, std~8.1), down -57% from prior regime P16-P18 avg~116 (130,115,102). Clear changepoint at P19 (102\u219243 drop), new regime length=3 periods sustained. On-hand=28 (low vs ~50 exp demand), in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (lead time consistently 0 across all 20+ periods). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture post-peak decline, L=default (confirmed 0). Backend base_stock~mu_hat=50.3 (z=0 at q=0.5), order~22 to cover demand minus on-hand, minimizing hold cost on excess while avoiding stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: avg declined from 116 (P16-P18:130,115,102) to 50 (P19-P21:43,48,60; -57%), sustained 3 periods post-June peak into early July

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15, mid-July summer). Necklace accessories seeing seasonal fluctuations; recent demands P19(6/17):43, P20(6/24):48, P21(7/1):60, P22(7/8):99 show uptrend (last 4 avg=62.5, +24% vs prior P19-P21 avg50 per carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments\u2014all historical lead times confirmed 0 periods consistently. New regime shift upward sustained P20-P22. Set L=default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat recent_N=4 and sigma_hat recent_N=4 to capture recent higher mean/volatility regime for (1+0) period ahead, balancing service (avoid stockout on ~62.5 exp demand) vs holding (q=0.5 implies base=mu_hat).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: avg increased from 50 (P19-P21:43,48,60) to 69 (P20-P22:48,60,99; +38%), sustained 3 periods early-mid July summer context

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22, mid-summer Monday). Necklace accessory in summer context shows sustained high demand regime from early July (carry-over: shift at P22 to avg69 P20-P22, now P23=76 confirms +7% higher, total regime P20-P23:48,60,99,76 avg71). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments (all historical LT=0 confirmed). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=4 >=3, captures summer uptick vs prior post-June decline; backend scales by sqrt(1+0)=1). L=default (promised 0, consistently observed). This raises base_stock ~71 + z*sigma_recent (q=0.5 median-like) to cover high demand, minimize stockouts/holding since inv=0.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29), late July summer context for women's Flirty Linnea necklace; potential seasonal demand after July 4th (P22:99 high possibly holiday-related). Recent demands P20-P24: 48,60,99,76,21 (mean 60.8, std ~33); follows carry-over regime shift at P22 to ~69 avg (P20-P22), extended by P23:76 but P24 drops to 21 (-72% from prior). Single low not sustained shift yet. On-hand=50 covers ~1 period recent avg; in-transit=0, no overdue/lost (all historical LT=0 confirmed). L=default (promised 0 matches all observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_5 to weight recent volatile summer regime (N=5 as regime ~5 periods from P20, capped sensibly). Balances service for ~61 mean demand (q=0.5 implies base~mu since z=0) vs holding (order ~11 low risk); adapts OR to recent patterns despite P24 dip.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5 early August, women's flirty necklace accessory; post-July summer demand, no major calendar events like back-to-school yet). On-hand=49, in-transit=0; all historical orders arrived same period (lead_time=0 confirmed, no losses/overdues). Recent demands: P25=12, P24=21 low (sharp drop from P23=76, -72%), P22=99, P23=76 high. Most recent confirmed changepoint Period 23 shift at P22 to high avg~69 (P20-P23:48,60,99,76 avg~71, sustained 4 periods); P24-P25 drop only 2 periods (not sustained 3+). Thus recent_5 (P21-P25:60,99,76,21,12 avg=53.6) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent regime avg/vol (~37 std) without overreacting to unconfirmed drop. L=default (0). Base_stock~54, pipeline=49 \u2192 order~5, total~54 covers expected demand; high sigma ensures cap>>order, balances service vs holding under q=0.5.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12), late summer early back-to-school season for women's necklace accessory; no immediate holidays but post-July summer peak slump. Recent demand P24-P26 (7/22-8/5): 21,12,17 avg=16.7, std\u22484.6, confirming new low-demand regime shift at P24 (-75% from prior P22-P23 avg=87.5:99,76), sustained 3 periods (regime_length=3). On-hand=37 covers ~2+ periods (37/16.7), in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments\u2014all historical LT=0 confirmed in concludes.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19), mid-August late summer into back-to-school season for women's necklace accessories; expect potential demand rebound as students/teens shop for accessories. Latest carry-over regime shift at P24: decline to low avg~16 (P24-26:21,12,17), sustained 3 periods post-July peak, but P27 demand=36 (+125% vs regime avg) signals possible reversal/uptrend not yet sustained. On-hand=1 low, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments\u2014all historical concludes confirm L=0 (e.g., P27 order arrived P27). Use L default (promised/confirmed 0). For mu_hat/sigma_hat, recent changepoint P24 regime now length=4 (P24-P27), but extend to N=5 recent periods (P23-P27:76,21,12,17,36; mean~32.4) to incorporate prior July high + recent dip + P27 uptick for robust forecast under volatility; backend computes mu_hat=32.4, sigma_hat~26*sqrt(1)=26. With p=h=1, q=0.5 z=0 so base_stock=mu_hat~32; order~31 (pipeline=1), cap~32+1.645*26~75 high enough; covers expected ~30-40 demand, minimizes stockouts while controlling holding via cap.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26), late summer/early fall transition with back-to-school and pre-Labor Day (Sep 2) potential demand drivers for women's necklace accessories. Recent demand post-decline regime (P24-P26: 21,12,17 avg 16 per carry-over): P27=36 (+112%), P28=70 (+94% from P27), indicating uptick (avg P26-P28=41). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all historical lead times=0 confirmed consistently). No lost orders. L=default (promised 0). mu_hat=recent_N N=3 (P26-P28 mean=41) to capture emerging up regime post-low (changelpoint ~P27, regime_length=2+ so N=3 min). sigma_hat=default (no sustained volatility shift).

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2, Labor Day Monday). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all historical orders arrived same period, L=0 confirmed). Recent demands P27-P29: 36,70,116 (avg=74, std~40), +362% from prior low regime P24-P26 avg=16, sustained 3 periods amid late Aug/early Sept Labor Day/back-to-school demand surge for women's necklace accessory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9): Early September post-Labor Day, back-to-school season for women's necklace accessories likely sustains high demand. Recent demands P27-P30: 36,70,116,127 (avg 87.25, std ~42), confirming sustained high regime shift at P27 (now 4 periods, +12% over prior P27-P29 avg74). No in-transit or on-hand (0), no overdue shipments\u2014all historical orders arrived same period (lead_time=0 confirmed consistently). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture elevated mean/volatility in current regime (N=4=max(min(regime_length=4,20),3)); L=default (promised=0, matches all observed). With q=0.5 (z=0), base_stock=mu_hat~(1+0)*87=87, orders~87 to cover expected demand and minimize stockouts/holding; cap accommodates volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand sustained high in back-to-school/early Sept: P27-P30 avg 87 (36,70,116,127; +12% over P27-P29=74), sustained 4 periods

With q=0.5 (p=h=1), z~0 so base_stock~91, order~91 to match expected demand, minimizing holding while covering service; cap irrelevant as low order.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30, late September post-back-to-school/Labor Day). Demand remains high in sustained regime since P27 (carry-over confirmed), with P27-P33 demands (36,70,116,127,104,90,115) avg=94 (high relative to prior regimes), recent P30-P33 avg~109 confirming no post-seasonal decline yet. Changepoint at P27 (per carry-over), regime length=7 periods (P27-P33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical lead times confirmed 0). Use L default (promised/actual consistently 0). mu_hat recent_N=7 captures regime mean~94 for (1+0)*94. sigma_hat recent_N=7 for std~32, low relative volatility. Sets base_stock~94 (z=0 at q=0.5), order~94 (pipeline=0), cap~147; balances high service for ~100 demand vs holding cost, avoiding stockout at 0 inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Lead time consistently 0 across all 34 periods, no losses or delays. On-hand 64 sufficient buffer (covers recent low or partial high demand). No new sustained changepoint (P34 drop single period, <3). Use recent_N=7 (P28-P34 regime length post-P27 shift: demands 70,116,127,104,90,115,30; avg~93) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent high mean/volatility without overreacting to outlier low; scales to mu_hat~93, sigma_hat~sqrt(1)*~34. With q=0.5 (z~0), base_stock~93, expected order~93-64=29; cap higher via sigma; balances service for potential Oct holiday uptick vs holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14 mid-Oct), post-back-to-school peak. Recent demands: P33(9/23):115 high tail-end, P34(9/30):30, P35(10/7):16 sharp drop (-76% vs prior P27-P33 avg~94), matching historical post-peak slumps (e.g., post-Easter P10-12:21/15/9 avg15 -62%; post-summer P24-26:21/12/17 avg17 -75%). Emerging low fall regime changepoint at P34 (regime_length=2), no Halloween spike expected soon for flirty necklace (Oct31 ~2wks out). On-hand=78 ample (covers ~5 periods at 16 avg), in-transit=0, no lost/overdue (all LT=0 confirmed). Use recent_N=3 (P33-P35) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to lower forecast (mu~(115+30+16)/3=54, high sigma~54 captures vol), prompting low/no order to cut holding vs prior high orders. L default (consistent 0 over 35 periods). Balances low service risk (high OH buffer) vs holding in low-demand Oct.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21, late October approaching Halloween). Recent demand regime shift at P34: declined from ~103 avg (P31-P33:104,90,115) to 32 avg (P34-P36:30,16,51; -68%), sustained 3 periods post-back-to-school slump. On-hand=27 (covers ~1 recent demand period), no in-transit, lead time consistently 0 (all 36 observed arrivals confirmed 0 periods). Use recent_3 for mu/sigma to capture low-volatility downshift (mean~32, std~18), L=default=0. This sets base_stock ~32 + z*18 (q=0.5,z~0), orders to cover 1+L=1 period demand minimizing hold with profit=hold=1 balance; anticipates possible Halloween uptick but prioritizes recent evidence over seasonal speculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: avg declined from 103 (P31-P33:104,90,115) to 32 (P34-P36:30,16,51; -68%), sustained 3 periods post-back-to-school into early October

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Halloween week (Oct 31), flirty necklace likely sees party/costume demand spike. Past holidays: Memorial Day P16 d=130, Labor Day P30 d=127, pre-Halloween P37 d=87 (up from post-back-to-school low regime P34-36 avg32). Recent demands P33-37:115,30,16,51,87 (mean~60, std~41). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time consistently 0 across 37 periods). No pipeline. Use L default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat explicit 100 to proactively cover anticipated Halloween spike (historical holiday avg ~110, recent ramp P36-37:51,87). sigma_hat recent_5 for recent volatility ~41 (captures post-dip rebound vol; changepoint P34 low regime length=3, but N=5 includes prior for stability). Raises base_stock~100 +0*41=100 (q=0.5), orders ~100 to satisfy demand, minimize lost sales (profit=1), limit excess hold (holding=1) expecting post-holiday drop.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand P36-P38: 51,87,81 (avg 73, +128% from prior P34-P36 avg 32), signals new high regime sustained 3 periods, overriding post-back-to-school decline. On-hand 19 low vs expected ~73-80; in-transit 0, no overdue (all historical LT=0 confirmed). L=default (promised/actual 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 captures regime (backend: mu_hat=73, sigma_hat\u224819).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demands P36-P39: 51,87,81,33 (avg 63, std ~22); follows carry-over P39 insight of shift at P36 to ~73 avg (P36-P38), but P39 dip to 33 (-55%) not sustained (1 period only). Lead time consistently 0 across all 39 periods (no in-transit, all orders arrive same period). On-hand=40 sufficient for moderate demand, no overdue/missing shipments. Use L='default' (promised 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat='recent_N' N=4 (regime_length=4 since P36 changepoint, N=max(min(4,20),3)=4) to focus on current volatile holiday precursor regime vs. all-history average (~50). Backend computes mu_hat=1*63=63, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*22~22; with q=1/(1+1)=0.5 (z~0), base_stock~63, balancing service vs. holding; cap higher for safety.

Recent demands: P37:87, P38:81, P39:33, P40:16 (dip after pre-Thanksgiving high, avg P36-P38:73 per carry-over, likely lull before holiday surge similar to prior events like Easter/Memorial/Labor Day spikes). On-hand=47, in-transit=0; lead time consistently 0 across all 40 periods (no losses/overdues). No pipeline gap. Changepoint at P36 sustained high regime now ~5 periods (P36-P40), but calendar demands proactive uplift. L=default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat=explicit 75 ((1+0)*75, matching holiday regime avg ~73-87, anticipates Black Friday ramp vs recent low 24 avg). sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 (P36-P40:51/87/81/33/16, std~30, captures vol; regime_length=5 post-P36 shift).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Monday before Thanksgiving (11/28), Black Friday (11/29) imminent; necklace is holiday gift item (women's accessories), prior pre-Thanksgiving spike (P36-38 avg73) but sharp sustained decline to low demand regime P39-P41:33,16,13 (avg21, std~10.8; -71% drop), possibly pre-holiday lull despite seasonal potential. On-hand=62 covers ~3 periods at recent avg; in-transit=0, no overdue (all historical LT=0 confirmed). Use default L (promised/actual=0). mu_hat recent_3 captures low regime mean~(1+0)*21 for conservative base stock amid holding=profit risk. sigma_hat recent_3 for low recent volatility, balances service vs holding by avoiding overstock on observed downturn.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: avg declined from 73 (P36-P38:51,87,81) to 21 (P39-P41:33,16,13; -71%), sustained 3 periods mid-Nov pre-Thanksgiving lull

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2, Cyber Monday/early Christmas holiday ramp-up). Necklace accessory ideal for gift-giving; prior seasonal peaks (Memorial Day P14-18 avg~97, Labor Day/back-to-school P27-33 avg~94) reached 100-130 demand. Recent P39-42 demands low (33,16,13,14 avg~19, std~9; continuing mid-Nov lull per carry-over Period 42), but calendar event mandates proactive surge forecast despite no sustained evidence yet. On-hand 48 + in-transit 0 risks ~50+ stockout loss if demand~100 (profit=1/h=1). All 42 prior orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed). L=default (promised 0). mu_hat=explicit 90 targets prior peak avg for (1+0) period, yielding base_stock~90 (order~42, total inv~90). sigma_hat=default uses full-history vol (~40 est., spikes contribute) to ensure cap~90+66=156 > needed, balancing service vs holding.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), early Christmas shopping season for giftable necklace accessory, but recent demands P39-P43 (Nov4-Dec2: 33,16,13,14,10; avg=17.2, std~8.1) continue sustained low regime from changepoint at P39 (per carry-over Period 42 insight: declined to ~21 P39-P41, now further to 17.2 over 5 periods, no spike evidence yet despite Dec2 P43 demand=10 post-Black Friday). Regime length=5, so recent_N N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (mu_hat=17.2, sigma_hat~8.1 over 1+L=1 period). L consistently 0 periods across all history. Pipeline=80+0>>17.2, order~0 targets low base_stock=17.2 (z=0), minimizes holding cost on excess while 80 on-hand covers potential moderate demand; cap raised slightly by sigma but irrelevant as base<pipeline. No overdue/lost shipments (all orders conclude same period).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), pre-Christmas (Dec 25) peak holiday gifting season for women's necklace/accessories; expect major demand spike similar to prior seasonal peaks (e.g., Memorial Day P16-18 avg 116, Labor Day P30=127). Recent demands low and sustained (P39-44: 33,16,13,14,10,12 avg 16.3, consistent with P42 carry-over decline to ~21 then lower), but proactively anticipate changepoint to high regime using calendar knowledge. On-hand=68, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments (all LT=0 confirmed across 44 periods). L=default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat=explicit 100 to target base_stock~100 covering expected holiday demand (prior peaks 100-130). sigma_hat=default leverages full-history volatility (high due to spikes) for elevated cap=mu+1.645*std_all (~100+~50=150+), allowing order~32 to build pipeline to 100 vs holding excess if low demand. Balances stockout risk (lost profit) vs holding cost given q=0.5.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): Christmas week peak for women's necklace gifts; expect major demand surge. Recent: P43-44 low (10,12 early Dec post-Thanksgiving lull), P45=73 (+525% spike, Dec16 ramp). Past peaks (Memorial P14-18 avg~110 std~25; back-to-school P27-33 avg94 std~30) inform ~120 mean. On-hand=27 low, in-transit=0, no overdue/losses (all LT=0 confirmed historically). L=default (promised 0 consistent). mu_hat=explicit 120 (Christmas-calibrated peak >P45 but matched to historical highs). sigma_hat=explicit 35 (peak volatility). Yields base=120, order~93 (to 120 total), covers high demand balancing service vs holding (q=0.5, z=0).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30), post-Christmas (after P46 12/23 demand=70 pre-holiday spike). Expect reversion to low demand regime P39-P44 (demands:33,16,13,14,10,12; avg=16.3, std~8.5; sustained 6 periods mid-Nov to early Dec, -71% from prior P36-P38 avg73). Holiday spike P45-P46 (73,70 avg71.5) temporary calendar-driven. Lead time consistently 0 across all 46 periods, no losses. On-hand=50 >> regime mean, in-transit=0. recent_N N=6 targets mu_hat~16, sigma_hat~8.5 for (1+L=1) period; base_stock~16 (z=0 at q=0.5), orders~0 to minimize holding costs while 50 buffer covers volatility/post-holiday low.
