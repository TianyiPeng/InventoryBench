Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), first decision, no prior orders/arrivals/concludes visible. Women's denim jacket (outdoor, winter season), steady historical demand: samples [9,6,16,8,14] mean=10.6, std\u22484.22, no changepoints or regime shifts detected (range 6-16 consistent). Upcoming Valentine's Day (2/14) unlikely to spike jacket demand significantly without evidence. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; use defaults to initialize base-stock policy with promised L=0, covering ~1 period demand (mu=10.6). High q=19/20=0.95 ensures strong service level vs low holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18), winter season relevant for women's outdoor denim jackets, likely supporting higher demand. Period 1 demand=30 vs historical samples mean=10.6 (9,6,16,8,14), std=4.22, indicating potential demand regime shift or seasonal spike (Period 1 changepoint evidence: +183% vs hist mean, but single period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Lead time confirmed as 0 (Period 1 order arrived same period). Backend default mu_hat=10.6 too low (caused stockout of 12 units last period, lost ~$228 profit). Set explicit mu_hat=30.0 to match recent demand level over (1+0) periods. Set explicit sigma_hat=10.0 to reflect increased volatility incorporating recent outlier (updated sample std ~8.8). L default. This elevates base_stock ~30 + 1.645*10 \u224846 (q=19/20=0.95), targets high service to capture profit while low holding cost allows buffer vs risk of repeat stockout.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), women's outdoor denim jacket in late winter (high seasonal demand potential). Demands spiked post-historical: P1=30, P2=55 (vs historical avg 10.6, std~4.2; changepoint at P1 with +200-400% jump, regime length=2 confirmed by consistent highs >2x prior max=16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (both prior orders arrived lead_time=0). Prior stockouts: P1=12, P2=8. Set L=default (promised 0, matches 2 observations). mu_hat recent_2 (last demands 30,55 \u2192 backend mean~42.5 \xd7(1+0)). sigma_hat recent_2 (vol~17.7 \xd7\u221a(1+0)). Yields base_stock~42.5+1.645\xd717.7~72 (q=19/20=0.95), orders ~72 to cover rising demand, boost service (high profit), minimize holding on low-cost item; adapts OR to recent regime vs historical bias.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4): Early March, women's denim jacket demand in high winter/early spring regime. Historical pre-P1 demands low (avg~10.6), but P1-P3: 30,55,59 (avg=48, +350% shift confirmed over 3 periods - changepoint at P1). On-hand=13, in-transit=0; all prior orders arrived same period (lead_time=0, no losses). Use recent_3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high demand regime (mu~(1+0)*48=48, sigma~sqrt(1)*12.8); L default (promised=0, observed consistent). Ensures base stock targets recent high mean + safety stock for volatility, balancing high profit vs low holding - covers expected ~50-60 demand without overstock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1: avg increased from 10.6 (pre-P1) to 48 (+350%) confirmed over P1-P3 demands 30/55/59

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Early March, women's denim jacket demand remains in high regime post-shift at P1 (old mean ~10.6, new P1-P4 demands 30/55/59/43 avg 46.75, +340%). No calendar events immediate (post-Valentine, pre-spring). Lead times consistently 0 across P1-P4 concludes (no drifts/losses). On-hand 31 (from P4 end), in-transit 0, covers ~0.7 recent demand; expect stockout risk if demand ~47. Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/volatility (std~13); L default=0 matches observed. Ensures base_stock targets service for (1+0) periods high demand, minimizing stockouts vs holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $771.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18, early spring; women's denim jacket - continued seasonal demand plausible). Demand regime shift to high levels sustained P1-P5 (demands 30/55/59/43/42, avg 45.8 vs historical ~10.6). No new changepoint (P4-P5 43/42 slight dip but still elevated). Lead times consistently 0 across P1-P5 concludes. On-hand 27 + in-transit 0 low vs expected ~46 demand; will likely stockout without order. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/variance regime (N=regime_length=5). L default (promised/observed=0). Parameters raise base_stock to ~mu=46 +1.645*sigma~12 = ~66, order~66-27=39 (high service q=19/20=0.95 balances profit/holding), preventing lost sales.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Late March, women's denim jacket demand in sustained high regime post-P1 shift (confirmed avg ~50 over P1-P6: 30/55/59/43/42/70). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; all prior orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0 consistently over 6 periods). No overdue shipments. Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on changepoint regime (length=6>=3), ignoring pre-P1 lows; L=default (matches observed). Ensures base_stock targets ~50 mean + safety for volatility (~18 std), balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding amid stockouts (P6=70).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1, early April, spring transition; women's outdoor denim jacket may see weather-driven demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments\u2014all prior 7 orders arrived with LT=0 (consistent). Demands P1-P7: 30,55,59,43,42,70,272 (post-P1 regime shift sustained 7 periods, avg~82 vs pre~11; P7 spike=272 caused major stockout, lost~198 sales). No new changepoint (P6-P7 higher but <3 periods). L=default (promised 0, matches all observed). mu_hat=recent_7 (regime length=7 since P1 shift, (1+0)*~82). sigma_hat=recent_7 (captures rising vol). Raises base_stock to boost service level against high recent demand/vol, minimizing lost profit ($19/unit) vs low holding ($1/unit).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), women's denim jacket. Demands show prior regime P1-P6 avg ~50, but sharp changepoint at P7 with P7=272, P8=253 (avg 262.5, +425% increase), suggesting new high-demand regime possibly tied to early spring/Easter (4/21) fashion surge. Regime length=2 periods, but using recent_N N=3 (P6-P8: 70/272/253, mean~198) for conservative mu_hat adaptation including emerging elevation at P6. Lead time consistently 0 across all 8 concluded periods (no losses/drift). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue. L=default matches observed. mu_hat recent_3 scales to ~198 for (1+0) period demand forecast. sigma_hat recent_3 captures elevated volatility (~111). This boosts base_stock to cover high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding, preventing stockouts like P7-P8 while limiting overstock.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), mid-spring; women's denim jacket may see demand spikes around Easter (4/21) and spring fashion. Confirmed new demand regime shift at P7: avg from 49.8 (P1-P6: 30/55/59/43/42/70) to 229 (P7-P9:272/253/163, +360%), sustained over 3 periods. All lead times consistently 0 periods (promised/default holds, no losses/overdues; in-transit=0). On-hand=219 covers recent P9 demand=163 but risks stockout on prior highs (253+). Use recent_N=3 (regime_length=3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target high-demand regime: mu~(1+0)*229=229, sigma~sqrt(1+0)*58=58; L=default. This raises base_stock~229+1.645*58~300 to cover 1-period (L+1) demand, balancing high profit service vs low holding; cap irrelevant as pipeline low.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg increased from 49.8 (P1-P6) to 229 (+360%) confirmed over P7-P9 demands 272/253/163

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter (April 21). Women's denim jacket demand in high regime since P7 shift (carry-over: avg 229 P7-P9, P10=169 still elevated vs pre-P7 ~50). Recent P7-P10 demands 272/253/163/169 avg=214 (+330% vs pre-P7), sustained 4 periods, no new changepoint (P9-P10 ~166 not yet 3+ periods lower). Lead time consistently 0 across P1-P10 concludes, no losses. On-hand=157 covers ~1 period but expect stockout if demand ~170+, in-transit=0. Use L=default (promised 0). mu_hat=recent_4 for (1+0)*214 forecast. sigma_hat=recent_4 for recent volatility (~56). Ensures high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding, OR caps order to pipeline-adjusted base_stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29), late spring; women's denim jacket demand post-Easter (4/21) stabilizing at lower regime ~167 (P9-P11: 163/169/168 avg 167, down ~27% from P7-P9 avg 229). No seasonality spike expected soon; demand shift downward confirmed over 3 periods. All lead times consistently 0 periods (P1-P11), no in-transit or losses; on-hand 139 covers partial demand, but order to base_stock ~167 + safety (z~1.645 for q=19/20=0.95) to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding ($1/unit). recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures new regime (low variance ~3); L default=0 ensures backend uses promised LT. This balances high service vs low holding by focusing on recent stable lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: avg decreased from 229 (P7-P9) to 167 (-27%) confirmed over P9-P11 demands 163/169/168

Recent demands P9-P12 (post-P9 regime shift): 163/169/168/227 (avg~182, std~31), extending confirmed P9-11 stable ~167 regime to 4 periods with P12 uptick (not yet sustained shift). L=default (promised 0, confirmed consistently). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 to use latest regime data for (1+0)*recent mean/vol; base_stock ~182 + 1.645*31 ~233 covers recent range (avoids P12 stockout) while q=19/20=0.95 balances high service vs low holding.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20), late spring for women's denim outdoor jacket; demand may taper seasonally but recent P12-14 shows 227/141/206 (avg 191, volatile). Prior regime P9-11 avg 167; recent 6 periods P9-14 avg 179 (slight +7% but not sustained shift). Lead times consistently 0 over 14 periods, no in-transit or losses; on-hand 21 low vs expected ~190 demand. Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent mean/vol ~179/31 while L=default (0) ensures OR targets base_stock for current regime, balancing high profit vs holding by focusing service on volatile highs. No overdue shipments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, Memorial Day - potential holiday boost for outdoor women's denim jacket). On-hand 29 low, in-transit 0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical lead times=0 confirmed in concludes). Recent demands P12-P15:227/141/206/202 (avg 194, std 37), vs prior P9-P11 avg167 std~3 - higher mean (+16%) and much higher volatility sustained 4 periods. No new mean shift as dramatic as prior (+350% etc.), but variance changepoint at P12. Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set mu_hat=194, sigma_hat=37 (L=0 so 1-period). Base_stock ~194 + 1.645*37 ~255, covers expected ~200 demand post-holiday consideration, minimizes stockout/holding (q=19/20=0.95). L default (consistent 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand variance regime shift at Period 12: std increased from ~3 (P9-P11:163/169/168) to 37 (+1133%) confirmed over P12-P15 demands 227/141/206/202

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3, early June, start of summer); women's outdoor denim jacket demand likely transitional but recent P12-16 shows sustained high mean ~197 (227/141/206/202/209) with high variance std~33, consistent with carry-over variance shift at P12. On-hand=46 low vs ~200 demand, in-transit=0, all historical LT=0 confirmed (16/16 orders arrived same period, no losses/overdues). Use recent_N=5 (regime_length=5 since P12 changepoint, min(5,20)>3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target current regime (1+L=1 period demand forecast), default L=0. This sets base_stock ~197 + 1.645*33 \u2248197+54=251 >46 pipeline for ordering ~205 (capped near), balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding while adapting to regime; default all-history mean~144 too low.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10, early summer): Women's outdoor denim jacket demand remains volatile post-P12 variance shift (std~37), recent P12-P17 demands [227,141,206,202,209,141] avg~188 (up from P9-P11 avg167), confirming sustained high mean/variance regime; no seasonal summer drop evident yet (only P17=141 low, not sustained 3+ periods). On-hand=110 low vs expected ~188 demand, in-transit=0, all historical lead times=0 (no losses/drift). Use default L=0 (promised/observed). recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures P12 regime (length=6): mu_hat=1*188 targets base_stock for ~188 mean, sigma_hat=1*~36 buffers volatility; balances high service (q~19/20=0.95) vs holding by leveraging OR's z* and cap, ordering to cover current demand post-arrival.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/6/17), early summer; women's outdoor denim jacket demand typically seasonal but remains elevated post-spring spikes. Recent P12-P18 demands (227,141,206,202,209,141,163) confirm variance regime shift at P12 (std~37), mean~184; prior regimes noted in carry-over. No in-transit or overdue shipments\u2014all historical LT=0 confirmed. On-hand=86 insufficient for ~184 exp demand. L=default (promised=0, matches all obs). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_7 to anchor on current high-variance regime (N=7=max(min(7,20),3)), yielding mu_hat~(1+0)*184=184, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*~30=30. High q=19/20=0.95 drives base_stock~184+1.645*30~215, covering demand/volatility vs holding cost; cap irrelevant as pipeline=86.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24, late June summer onset). Women's denim outdoor jacket demand likely softening seasonally into summer. Lead time consistently 0 across all 19 periods, no losses or delays. On-hand 90, in-transit 0. Demands P12-P19 (variance regime per carry-over): 227/141/206/202/209/141/163/152, mean~180, std~34. Emerging downward shift P17-P19 avg152 vs P12-P16 197 (-23%), but use full recent_8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained volatile regime (N=8=max(min(regime_length=8,20),3)). With L=0 (default), mu_hat~(1+0)*180=180, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*34~34, base_stock~180+1.645*34~236 (q=19/20=0.95), order~236-90=146 covers expected ~150-200 demand post-arrival, balancing high service vs low holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg decreased from 197 (P12-P16:227/141/206/202/209) to 152 (-23%) confirmed over P17-P19 demands 141/163/152

On-hand=99 covers <1 period demand; no in-transit, all past orders arrived same-period (L=0 confirmed consistently). No overdue shipments. Use default L=0. recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target recent stable low-demand/low-var (regime length=4, changepoint P17 per carry-over), yielding mu_hat=148.5, sigma_hat~10; q=19/20=0.95, z~1.64, base_stock~165 ensures coverage of 1-period demand post-decline while minimizing hold cost on excess.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8, summer - low demand season for denim/outdoor women's jackets). Recent demands P17-P21: 141/163/152/138/127 (avg 144, std ~14), continuing downtrend from confirmed P17 regime shift to ~152 avg, now lower but sustained 5 periods. On-hand 41 (low vs ~140 exp), in-transit 0, no overdue/lost (all LT=0 confirmed consistently). Use recent_N=5 (P17+ regime length=5) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect low mean/volatility; default L=0. Lowers OR base stock ~144 + 1.645*14 \u2248168 (q=19/20=0.95), balancing low holding risk vs stockout on ~140 demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15), mid-summer in Northern Hemisphere; women's outdoor denim jacket demand declining as warmer weather reduces need (recent P20-22: 138/127/104, avg 123, continuing post-P17 drop from ~197 to 152). On-hand 63, in-transit 0; all 22 prior orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0), no losses/delays. Most recent demand regime changepoint at P20 (length=3 periods), so recent_3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat: mu_hat~(1+0)*123=123, sigma_hat~sqrt(1+0)*17.4=17.4. Lowers base_stock vs longer windows (e.g., recent_6 mu=137.5), targeting ~123 + 1.645*17.4 ~151 total (order ~88 post-63 on-hand), ensuring high service (q=19/20=0.95) while minimizing holding on declining demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: avg decreased from 152 (P17-P19:141/163/152) to 123 (-19%) confirmed over P20-P22 demands 138/127/104; Demand variance regime shift at Period 17: std decreased from ~37 (P12-P15) to ~20.5 (-45%) confirmed over P17-P22 demands 141/163/152/138/127/104 (std=20.5)

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22), summer season for Northern Hemisphere; women's denim jacket demand expected low/off-season. Recent demands P20-P23: 138/127/104/111 (avg=120, std\u224816), confirming sustained decrease from prior regime (P17-P19 avg=152, carry-over P20-P22 avg=123). Changepoint at P20 (regime_length=4 periods, N=4). On-hand=41 low vs expected ~120 demand; in-transit=0, no pipeline. All historical lead times=0 (consistent, no losses/delays). L=default (promised 0). mu_hat=recent_N N=4 for recent low mean (backend:1*120). sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 for low recent volatility (backend:sqrt(1)*~16). Balances high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding by using recent low stats, avoiding overstock from historical spikes.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29, late summer). Women's denim jacket demand in summer low season, continuing downward trend: recent P20-24 demands 138/127/104/111/73 (avg 110.6, std ~25). Matches P23 carry-over regime shift at P20 to avg~123 (now extended lower). All historical lead times confirmed 0 periods (no drifts or losses; in-transit=0, on-hand=73 covers partial recent demand). No overdue shipments. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to focus on current low-demand regime (regime length=5 since P20 changepoint), yielding mu_hat=110.6, sigma_hat~25 (backend scales by 1+L=1). L=default (promised 0 confirmed). High profit/holding ratio (19:1) favors coverage of ~111\xb125; parameters lower base_stock vs all-data to cut holding on 73 on-hand amid declining demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5, early August summer - low seasonal demand expected for denim/outdoor jackets). Recent demands P23-25:111/73/78 (avg 87, std ~9.7), continuing downtrend from P20-22 avg 123 (-29%). Full recent regime P20-25 (length 6):138/127/104/111/73/78 (avg 105, std ~24). All 25 periods confirm actual LT=0 (no losses/overdues, in-transit=0). On-hand=74 covers ~1 period. Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect lower recent mean/vol (mu_hat=105, sigma_hat=24); L=default (0). Backend base_stock~105+1.645*24~144, order~70 to cover ~90-110 demand w/ high service (q=0.95), minimizing stockout risk vs holding.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12), late summer; low demand expected for women's denim/outdoor jacket as warm weather persists, aligning with ongoing downtrend. Recent demands P23-P26: 111/73/78/67 (avg 82.25), continuing decline from prior regime avg 87 (P23-P25). On-hand 81 covers recent demand (~70-80); in-transit 0, no overdue shipments\u2014all historical lead times confirmed 0 periods. Changepoint at P23 (per carry-over), regime length 4 periods (P23-P26). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low mu_hat~(82) and sigma_hat~20, targeting base_stock ~82 + 1.645*20 ~120; with on-hand 81, orders ~39 capped low, balancing low holding risk vs service on subdued demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent P24-P28 demands:73/78/67/85/65 (avg=73.6, std\u22489.3), no new sustained shift (P27:85/P28:65 fluctuate within regime). All historical lead times=0 (consistent arrivals, no in-transit/overdues), on-hand=24 low vs ~74 expected demand (after decision). Use default L (promised 0). recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures current low-demand regime (N=5=max(min(regime_length=5,20),3)), lowers base_stock=\u03bc\u0302+z\u03c3\u0302 (q=19/20=0.95) to balance service vs holding cost amid downtrend.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2, Labor Day Monday, early fall transition). Women's outdoor denim jacket demand in declining regime per carry-overs (latest shift P24 to avg73), but P27-P29 demands 85/65/40 confirm new changepoint at P27: avg 63.3 (-13% from 72.7 P24-P26), with variance shift std 22.5 (+309% from 5.5). On-hand 48 covers recent low demand (P29=40), in-transit 0, no overdue shipments (all 29 prior orders arrived same-period, L=0 confirmed). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to track new low-demand/high-volatility regime (regime_length=3, N=3); L default (promised/observed 0). With q=19/20=0.95 (z~1.645), parameters target base_stock ~63 + 1.645*22.5 ~99, ordering ~51 to buffer volatility/service while minimizing holding on declining trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: avg decreased from 72.7 (P24-P26:73/78/67) to 63.3 (-13%) confirmed over P27-P29 demands 85/65/40; Demand variance regime shift at Period 27: std increased from 5.5 (P24-P26) to 22.5 (+309%) confirmed over P27-P29 demands 85/65/40

Period 32 (2019/9/16): Early fall; denim women's outdoor jacket demand in sustained low regime post-multiple downward shifts (latest P27 avg~63 over P27-P29, now extended with P30:43/P31:39 confirming continued decline to recent avg~54). On-hand=54 covers expected demand ~40-50 with no in-transit or overdue shipments (all historical LT=0 confirmed). No losses. Use recent_N=5 (P27-P31 regime length=5, demands 85/65/40/43/39 mean=54.4 std~20) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to adapt to low mean/high(ish) variance; L=default (promised/actual=0). This targets base_stock ~54 + 1.645*20 ~78 (q=19/20=0.95), promoting sales vs holding while covering (1+0) periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Women's denim jacket, early fall transition; demand steadily declining since summer peaks (Jul-Aug ~70s, now Sept P29-P32:40/43/39/42 avg=41, std~1.8). Carry-over confirms multiple downward shifts culminating in low stable regime post-P27. On-hand=46 covers expected ~41 demand; in-transit=0, all past orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0 consistently, no losses). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture latest low-demand/low-variance regime (chgpnt ~P29/30, length=4, N=max(min(4,20),3)=4), backend computes mu_hat=(1+0)*41=41, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*1.8~1.8 for tight base_stock ~41 + high z*0.95*1.8, minimizing hold cost on excess 46 while ensuring service. L=default (promised=0 matches all observed).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg decreased from 63.3 (P27-P29) to 41.3 (-35%) confirmed over P30-P32 demands 43/39/42; Demand variance regime shift at Period 30: std decreased from 22.5 (P27-P29) to 1.8 (-92%) confirmed over P30-P32 demands 43/39/42

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): Women's denim jacket, end of September approaching fall; potential seasonal demand uptick for jackets, but recent demand P30-P33: 43/39/42/50 (avg=43.5, std=4.6) remains in low regime post-P30 shift (avg 41.3, low std 1.8), with P33=50 slight increase but not sustained. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline; P33 ordered=0 caused stockout on 50 demand. Lead time consistently 0 across all 33 periods (no losses/d drifts). Use default L=0 (promised/observed). recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to track current low-demand regime (regime_length=4 since P30 changepoint), yielding mu_hat=1*43.5, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*4.6; balances service (z*~0.95 for profit=19/h=1 q~0.95) vs holding by basing on recent stable low mean/volatility, avoiding overorder amid downward trend.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7), early fall; women's denim jacket demand may rise seasonally with cooling weather, but recent P30-P34 demands (43/39/42/50/38) confirm ongoing low-demand regime (avg=42.4, std~4.2) post Period 30 shift (avg 41.3). All historical lead times=0 (no losses/drift). On-hand=14, in-transit=0 covers <1 period demand. Use default L=0 (promised/observed). recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures stable low regime (N=5 as regime_length>=5 since P30 changepoint). Backend base_stock ~42 + 1.645*4 ~49 (q=19/20=0.95); orders ~35 to cover 1+ period, minimizing holding on low demand while preventing stockouts.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14), mid-fall season for women's denim outdoor jackets; demand may rise with cooling weather but recent P33-P35:50/38/18 (avg 35.3, std 16.2) confirms low demand regime continuation with increased volatility vs prior P30-P32 avg41.3 std1.8. All historical lead times=0 (no losses/overdues), in-transit=0, on-hand=33 covers ~1 period expected demand. No pipeline issues. Latest changepoint P33 (per carry-over), regime_length=3 (P33-P35), so recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat: mu_hat=35.3 (lowers base stock to ~35+1.65*16~51, orders ~18 to replenish conservatively minimizing holding on low demand while high profit q=19/20=0.95 supports coverage). L default=0 as confirmed consistent. Parameters bridge to low recent forecast despite seasonal potential uptick.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: avg decreased from 41.3 (P30-P32) to 35.3 (-14%) confirmed over P33-P35 demands 50/38/18; Demand variance regime shift at Period 33: std increased from 1.8 (P30-P32) to 16.2 (+800%) confirmed over P33-P35 demands 50/38/18

On-hand=30 sufficient for ~1 period at current levels, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. All historical lead times=0 periods consistently. Use default L (promised 0). recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime length=4 periods since P33 changepoint, N=max(min(4,20),3)=4) to scale backend base stock to recent low mean/volatility (std~13), ensuring coverage for (1+0) periods while minimizing holding costs (q~0.95 high service justified by profit=19 vs holding=1).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Women's denim jacket, late October approaching Halloween (not highly relevant for jackets) and pre-winter; demand may stabilize or rise seasonally but recent data shows continuation of P33 regime shift (avg ~35 initially, now P33-P37: 50/38/18/32/23 avg=32.2, std~12.6). No in-transit, on-hand=34 covers ~1 recent demand; all historical LT=0 confirmed (no losses/overdues). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=5 since P33 changepoint, N=max(min(5,20),3)=5) to set mu_hat=1*32.2, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*12.6 for base_stock ~32+1.645*12.6~53 targeting high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding; L=default (promised/observed 0).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4), early November, women's denim outdoor jacket; approaching winter/holidays but recent demands continue sharp decline: P36-P38:32/23/13 (avg=22.7, -36% from prior P33-P35 avg=35.3). Multiple prior downward regime shifts (carry-over confirms). No in-transit, all historical arrivals confirmed lead_time=0 (no losses/delays). On-hand=40 exceeds recent demand (~23), but high profit ($19 vs $1 holding) favors stocking for potential uptick. L=default (confirmed 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_5 (P34-P38:38/18/32/23/13, mean~24.8, std~10.2) captures latest low-demand regime post-changepoint at P36, adjusting OR base_stock down to minimize excess holding while covering (1+0) periods.

On-hand 20 covers ~1 period at recent mean, in-transit 0, no overdue (all 40 prior orders arrived LT=0). Use default L (promised 0, matches all history). recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures current low-demand/low-variance regime (length=5 since P36 changepoint), yielding mu_hat~(1+0)*19.8=19.8, sigma_hat~sqrt(1+0)*7.0=7.0; base_stock~19.8 + 1.645*7 ~30 (q=19/20=0.95), orders ~10 to cover expected + buffer without excess holding (h=1 low).

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25), week includes Black Friday (Nov 29), major retail event driving apparel/jacket demand spikes via calendar knowledge; women's outdoor denim jacket relevant for holiday/winter sales. Recent demands P39-P41:16/15/15 (mean=15.3, std=0.6), confirming continued low regime post prior shifts. On-hand=18 sufficient for baseline ~15 but risks stockout on BF surge (past peaks ~200+). All historical LT=0 confirmed (no in-transit/overdues). Set L=default (promised 0). mu_hat explicit=50 to proactively forecast BF uplift (3x recent, conservative vs peaks). sigma_hat explicit=20 for elevated volatility around event (higher than recent 0.6 but below historical ~13-37). Enables base_stock~50+1.645*20~83, order~65 (post-18 pipeline), high q=0.95 service vs low hold.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: avg decreased from 22.7 (P36-P38:32/23/13) to 15.3 (-33%) confirmed over P39-P41 demands 16/15/15; Demand variance regime shift at Period 39: std decreased from 9.5 (P36-P38) to 0.6 (-94%) confirmed over P39-P41 demands 16/15/15

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02, Cyber Monday, onset of Christmas holiday season). Women's outdoor fitted denim jacket aligns with winter apparel and gifting demand drivers; expect proactive ramp-up in sales (past peaks ~200+ during prior seasonal surges, recent P42 demand=35 vs P39-P41 ~15 (+133%) signals emerging uptick). On-hand=48, in-transit=0 (position=48), LT consistently 0 across all 42 periods (no losses/overdues). Latest carry-over regime (P39 shift: mean~15.3, low std~0.6 confirmed P39-P41) broken by P42=35, but not yet sustained 3+ periods for new insight. Recent_10 (P33-P42) mean=25.5, std~12; recent_20 mean~45, higher std~32. To bridge recent downtrend with calendar-driven holiday anticipation (Dec 2-30 covers pre-Christmas peak periods), set explicit mu_hat=50 (uplift ~100% from recent_10 mean, conservative vs historical peaks 4x+ lows), sigma_hat=30 (elevated for vol resurgence/seasonal uncertainty). Yields base_stock\u224850+1.645\xd730\u224899 (>48 position), ordering ~51 to buffer spikes while minimizing holding ($1 low vs $19 profit); OR backend achieves high service q=0.95. L default (promised/observed=0).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9): Pre-Christmas period for women's denim jacket (winter/outdoor wear), potential holiday demand spike possible, but recent demands P39-P43 (16/15/15/35/6) show low mean 17.4 with std ~10.7, consistent with declining regime shift at P39 (avg 15.3 P39-P41, low std 0.6) per carry-over; P42=35 uptick not sustained (P43=6 low). All historical lead times confirmed 0 periods (no losses, in-transit=0). On-hand=94 covers multiple periods of ~17 demand. Use L=default (promised 0 confirmed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 captures latest regime (N=5=max(min(regime_length~5,20),3)), yielding low ~17.4 mean/~10.7 std for (1+0) period to set conservative base_stock, minimizing order-up-to given high inventory, balancing high service (q~0.95) vs holding costs.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), pre-Christmas (Dec 25 ~9 days away); women's denim jacket may see holiday/winter demand bump, but recent demands P39-P44 (16/15/15/35/6/1) show low mean ~14.7 post-P39 regime shift (carry-over), with no spike yet (P43:6, P44:1 very low despite proximity). On-hand 93 high (covers ~30+ periods at recent avg), in-transit 0, no overdue/lost shipments. All observed lead times=0 (44 confirms). Use L default (promised 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=6 (regime since P39 shift, length=6<=20, >=3) for (1+0)*recent low mean/volatility to keep base_stock modest, balance high service q=19/20=0.95 vs holding $1 (avoid excess inv given downward trend).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23), pre-Christmas (Dec 25). Women's outdoor denim jacket likely sees holiday gift demand potential despite recent low demands: P43:6, P44:1, P45:9 (avg~5.3). On-hand 84 covers multiple low-demand periods (holding cost low at $1). Lead time consistently 0 across all 45 periods (no in-transit, no losses). Latest regime shift at P39 (carry-over: avg~15.3, low var); regime length to P45=7 periods, confirmed by stable low teens with some volatility (P42:35 outlier). Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent downward trend/volatility increase (avg~13.9, std~10.9), scaled by (1+L=1). Default L=0. Parameters inform OR base_stock ~13.9 + 1.645*10.9 ~30, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding; current stock exceeds, so minimal order unless spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30), post-Christmas/New Year's Eve; women's denim jacket demand typically low post-holiday slump/clearance after winter peak. Recent demands P43-P46: 6/1/9/8 (avg=6, std~3.3), confirming sustained drop vs prior regime avg15.3 (P39-P41), no calendar-driven rebound expected. On-hand=76 covers ~12 periods at recent avg demand, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments (all historical LT=0 confirmed). Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low base_stock ~6 + z*3.3 (q=19/20=0.95, z~1.645 \u2192 target~11), yielding order=min(11-76,cap)=0, minimizing holding costs while covering low demand; L=default (promised=0 matches all observed).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: avg decreased from 15.3 (P39-P41) to 6 (-61%) confirmed over P43-P46 demands 6/1/9/8; Demand variance regime shift at Period 43: std increased slightly from 0.6 (P39-P41) to 3.3 (+450%) but remains low, confirmed over P43-P46
