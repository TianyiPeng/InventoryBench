Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), first decision, on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no prior conclude messages or arrivals to observe. Product: women's fine-knit trainer socks, steady demand category. Historical demand (5 weeks prior to current date): 28,38,34,44,41 (mean~37, std~5.6), consistent winter levels, no changepoints or seasonal spikes evident (post-Chinese New Year Feb 5, but socks stable). No lead time data. Use defaults: backend applies L=0 (promised), mu_hat=(1+0)*mean_all=37, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*std_all~5.6. Ensures base_stock covers expected demand with service level q=19/(19+1)=0.95, orders min(base_stock - pipeline=0, cap), builds initial inventory safely vs holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18): Womens fine-knit trainer socks, mid-February winter season with steady demand, no major calendar events impacting socks. Inventory: on-hand=5 (low), in-transit=0. P1 conclude confirms LT=0 as promised (ordered P1 arrived P1). Demand history: early 2 samples (2019-01-07/14) avg=33, then shift to higher regime from 2019-01-21: last 4 hist samples avg=39.25 (+19%), P1 demand=43 confirms sustained higher mean ~40. Changepoint evidence: 21% increase, lower volatility recent std=4.27 vs overall 6.24. L=default (confirmed 0). mu_hat=explicit 34.25: unbiased recent_4 mean=39.25 adjusted down by on-hand=5 to correct for backend policy ignoring on-hand (ensures order = unbiased target S - IP, where unbiased S~46.3). sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 (std=4.27 for recent regime, unbiased safety). This balances high service (q=0.95) vs holding cost, targeting ~40+ demand while minimizing excess given low on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: weekly avg increased from 33 (Jan 7/14) to 39.25 last 4 hist samples (+19%), sustained with P1 (Feb 11)=43 (+21% overall recent avg); recent std lower at 4.27 vs early.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25): Women's fine-knit trainer socks in late winter; no major calendar events, but demand shows sustained upward regime shift from 2019-01-21 (carry-over confirmed) with recent demands 34,44,41,43,66 (5 periods, avg=45.6, +38% vs early avg33). P2 demand=66 confirms continuation/spike in regime, stockout occurred (ending OH=0 after demand=66>42). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; prior orders arrived LT=0 (no losses/overdues). L=default (promised/observed=0). mu_hat=recent_N N=5 and sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 to capture higher recent mean/vol in regime (N=regime_length=5), boosting base_stock for high-profit item (q~0.95) to prevent stockouts while capping limits overstock. Since L=0, focuses on 1-period forecast ~46 mean.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), socks product, early March no major events but winter-transition steady demand possible. Recent demands P1:43, P2:66, P3:57 (avg 55.3, +48% vs historical avg 37 across 5 pre-game samples), volatility up (std~9.5 vs prior lower). Confirmed sustained high-demand regime over last 3 periods. All lead times observed=0 (P1-P3 arrives), no in-transit/overdues, on-hand=9 low vs ~55 demand. L=default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat=recent_3 and sigma_hat=recent_3 to capture elevated mean/volatility in recent regime (backend scales by 1+L=1), enabling higher base_stock q~0.95 for service while capping overstock risk; addresses prior stockouts (P2 ended 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further shifted higher Periods 1-3: avg 55.3 (+48% vs historical 37), std increased to 9.5 (from prior ~4-6); sustained across 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Early March, post-winter socks demand; recent softening evident in P4 demand=44 (vs P1-3 avg=55), but still +19% above historical ~37 avg. Inventory: on-hand=31 (from P4 ending), in-transit=0; all prior 4 orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed consistently, no losses). Recent demand regime sustained P1-4: mean=52.5 (+42% vs hist), std=9.55 (elevated). Use default L=0 (promised/observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 to anchor on high-demand/vol regime (N=4=max(regime_length=4,3), changepoint P1 shift per carry-over). Raises base_stock~(52.5 + 1.645*9.55)~70 to cover ~52 exp demand post-31 on-hand (q=19/20=0.95 high service), minimizing stockout vs holding.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Early spring, socks demand steady post-winter, no major events. On-hand=28, in-transit=0; all prior orders arrived same-period (LT=0 confirmed in P1-5 concludes, no losses). Recent demands P1-5: 43,66,57,44,43 (mean=50.6 > hist ~37; std~10.5, higher volatility). Carry-over higher regime sustained (P1-3 avg55.3, overall recent +37%). Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture ongoing higher mean/volatility (regime_length=5>3); L=default (promised=0 matches all 5 observes). Params target base_stock ~mu + 1.645*sigma (~50.6+17.3=67.9) covering recent demand distro, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs low holding; with LT=0, orders cover current demand post-decision.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), late March, basic women's socks; no immediate holidays (Easter April 21), steady seasonal demand expected post-winter. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments\u2014all prior orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed across P1-6). Demand regime shifted higher: P1-6 avg=54.3 (+47% vs hist mean=37), std~12 (up from hist~6); sustained 6 periods per carry-over. P6=73 spike caused stockout. Use default L=0 (matches all observed). recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current high-demand regime (mu_hat=54.3, sigma_hat~12), boosting base_stock ~54 + 1.645*12\u224874 to cover spikes/service (q=19/20=0.95), minimizing lost sales vs holding.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01), early spring, basic women's socks/tights - steady category but recent game demands show upward trend and volatility: P4=44, P5=43, P6=73, P7=98 (avg 64.5, sample std ~26.3). Prior P1-3 avg 55.3, std~9.5, confirming carry-over higher regime now with increased vol. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline, consistent L=0 arrivals (all 7 periods observed L=0, no losses). Stockouts in P6-7 (22 units lost P7). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target recent regime: backend computes mu_hat=64.5, sigma_hat~26.3 (L=0 so 1-period). Base stock ~64.5 + 1.645*26.3 ~64.5+43.3=107.8 (q=19/20=0.95), orders ~108 capped similarly, covers recent peaks (98), high service vs low holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early April approaching Easter (4/21), but no clear sock demand tie-in; sustained high volatile demand regime since game start (P1-8 avg 62, std ~22), further escalation P5-8 avg 71.5 (+36% vs P1-4 52.5), peaks at 98 (P7). Inventory: on-hand 36, in-transit 0, no overdue/missing shipments\u2014all 8 prior orders arrived same-period (L=0 confirmed). Use L default (promised 0, matches all observed). mu_hat recent_8 captures elevated mean demand over full game regime (backend: 1*mean(P1-8)~62). sigma_hat recent_8 for increased volatility (backend: sqrt(1)*std(P1-8)~22). High profit/holding ratio implies q~0.95, parameters boost base-stock for service vs cost balance; covers ~1 period demand post-decision.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further shifted higher Periods 5-8: avg 71.5 (+36% vs P1-4 avg 52.5), std ~22.5 (up from prior); sustained 4 periods with peak 98.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), womens trainer socks. Recent demand sustained high regime (P5-9: 43,73,98,72,69; avg=71, std~19.5), confirming carry-over P5-8 shift (avg71.5, std22.5). All observed lead times=0 (P1-9 orders arrived same period), no delays/losses, in-transit=0, on-hand=25 low vs ~70 demand. No calendar events (mid-April, post-Easter no sock spike). Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target elevated mean/variance over 1+L=1 period; L default (promised 0 confirmed). Ensures base_stock ~71 + z*19.5 (q~19/20=0.95, z~1.64) covers demand, minimizing stockouts despite high profit incentive, while capping avoids excess hold cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22, post-Easter Monday), basic women's fine-knit trainer socks. Steady demand expected post-Easter, no major calendar spikes anticipated for socks category. On-hand=26 low vs recent demand ~70-80; in-transit=0, no pipeline or overdue shipments\u2014all 10 prior orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed consistently). Demand regime high sustained: carry-over notes shift P5-8 avg71.5 std~22.5 (+36% vs prior); P6-10 further sustains high mean=78 (73,98,72,69,78), recent std~11.6 (lower volatility). Changepoint evidence: post-P5 low (43), consistent ~70-80 for 5 periods (regime_length=5>3). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current high mean/volatility, scaled by (1+L=1); L=default (promised=0 matches all observed). High profit/holding ratio (19/1) favors service level; params target base_stock ~78 +1.645*11.6 \u224898 to cover demand + buffer, avoiding stockouts while minimizing excess hold.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29, late April/spring - socks demand typically stable/year-round but data shows sustained high regime into spring, no major events). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 (consistent LT=0 across all 11 periods: every order arrives same period). Recent demands P7-P11: 98,72,69,78,116 (avg=86.6 +26% vs prior P5-8 avg71.5 noted in carry-over, std~20 vs prior~22.5 but volatile with P11=116 peak). No overdue shipments. Changepoint evidence: high demand sustained P7-11 (5 periods). Set L='default' (promised=0, matches all observed). mu_hat='recent_N' N=5 (backend: 1*86.6=86.6). sigma_hat='recent_N' N=5 (backend: sqrt(1)*~20). Ensures base_stock~86.6 + 1.645*20 \u2248119 (q=19/20=0.95), covers recent peaks/high service vs holding cost; cap sufficient. Addresses stockouts (e.g., P11 demand116>98).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further shifted higher Periods 9-11: avg 87.7 (+22% vs P5-8 avg71.5), sustained 3 periods with volatility (69,78,116); overall P7-11 avg86.6.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6, early May, potential Mother's Day May12 apparel boost but uncertain for socks). Demand sustained high in recent regime P7-12 (demands:98,72,69,78,116,102; avg=89.2, std\u224817.5), continuing carry-over shifts (P9-11 avg87.7, P12=102 reinforces +22% prior). All 12 periods confirm actual L=0 (every conclude: 'lead_time was 0 periods'), no in-transit/losses. On-hand=18 low vs expected ~90 demand; pipeline=0. Use recent_6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on sustained high mean/vol regime (length=6>3, post-P7 changepoint). L=default (promised=0, matches all observed).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13, post-Mother's Day May 12), women's socks/tights; demand volatile in spring but sustained high regime per carry-over (P7-11 avg~86.6). Recent P7-13 demands (98,72,69,78,116,102,61) avg~85 (+>2x initial hist ~37), std~20 (up from early ~4-6), P13=61 dip single-period not sustained changepoint (needs 3+). Lead time consistently 0 across all 13 concludes, no in-transit/missing. On-hand=60 covers ~0.7 recent avg demand periods; low risk stockout if demand~85. Use L default (promised 0); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 for current high-mean/high-vol regime (N=7=max(min(regime~7,20),3)), raises base_stock~(1+0)*85 + z*20 to boost service level vs holding, maximizing R_t given profit=19>>holding=1.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20, late spring/early summer). Socks demand remains in high regime per carry-over (P7-11 avg~86.6, P9-11 87.7), recent P10-14 demands 78,116,102,61,74 (mean 86.2, std~22.3, volatile with P13 dip but not sustained drop). No calendar spikes (post-Mother's Day May12), but summer may soften sock demand longer-term\u2014monitor. Lead times consistently 0 periods (all 14 observed), no in-transit/ losses, on-hand 45 low vs. ~86 weekly need (covers <1 period). Use default L=0. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 to capture ongoing high mean/volatility post-regime shifts (N=5 as recent regime ~5+ periods, min 3/max20). High q=19/20=0.95 drives strong service; recent params ensure base_stock ~86 + 1.645*22 ~130, order ~85 (after IP=45), balancing sales vs. low holding.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27), late May entering early summer; women's trainer socks may see moderated demand due to warmer weather, but no confirmed sustained drop (P13=61 low outlier, P14=74/P15=76 stabilizing ~75, last4 avg=78 vs prior highs). All 15 periods confirm lead_time=0 (no in-transit/overdues, on-hand=47 low vs recent ~80 demand). Use default L=0. recent_N=5 (P11-15:116,102,61,74,76; mean=85.8, std~22.5) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture ongoing high-demand volatile regime per carry-overs (P9-11 avg87.7 extended), yielding base_stock~85.8 + 1.645*22.5 ~114; order~114-47=67 balances high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding, proactive for potential demand spikes.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03, early summer); socks demand typically steady/non-seasonal peak, but game history shows sustained high demand regime from P7+ (avg ~85, per carry-over P12 insight extended). Recent P9-16 demands (69,78,116,102,61,74,76,102) avg 84.75 with std ~19.4, confirming ongoing high mean/volatility post-P12 shift (P13 dip to 61 not sustained, recovered to 102). On-hand 21 low, in-transit 0, no overdue (all 16 prior orders arrived same-period L=0). Use default L=0 (consistent actual). recent_8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat targets current regime (regime_length~8 from P9 changepoint, N=min(8,20)=8>3), yielding mu_hat=84.75*(1+0), sigma_hat=19.4*sqrt(1+0); supports high service (z~1.645 for q=0.95) to avoid stockouts (cover ~108 base stock) vs holding, maximizing R_t given low inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10), early summer; women's trainer socks demand typically seasonal but remains high and volatile, no evident drop yet (P17 demand=76). On-hand=41 low vs recent ~80, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments\u2014all 17 historical lead times confirmed=0 periods (consistent with promised). Recent demand regime sustained high since ~P9 (per carry-over), most recent changepoint ~P12; P12-17 (6 periods): avg=81.8, std~15.2 (volatile with 61 dip but highs at 102). Use recent_6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current regime (N=6=max(min(6,20),3)), L=default=0. This sets mu_hat~82, sigma_hat~15 (backend-scaled), base_stock~82 + 1.64*15~106 (q=19/20=0.95), targets order~106-41=65 to cover demand+1period lead, high service vs low hold cost; default L ensures backend uses correct 0.

Ensures OR base_stock ~76 + z*12.8 (z~1.645 for q=19/20=0.95) covers (1+0) period demand, prioritizing sales (high profit) over holding while adapting to regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward starting Period 13: avg 76.25 (P13-20) vs 91.25 (P9-12), -17%; sustained 8 periods, std~12.8 (from prior higher).

All historical lead times confirmed 0 periods (21/21 orders arrived same-period, no in-transit or losses). Recent demand regime downward since P13 stable: P13-21 demands avg 76.4 (sum=688/9), fits carry-over P13-20 avg76.25; includes volatility (std~13 inferred from prior ~12.8 + P21=78). On-hand=20 low vs expected ~76 demand, pipeline=0. Use default L=0 (matches observed). mu_hat recent_9 for current regime (N=9=max(min(9,20),3), changepoint P13 sustained 9 periods). sigma_hat recent_9 to capture recent volatility. Ensures backend base_stock ~76 +1.645*13\u224897 (high service q=19/20=0.95), covers 1-period (L+1) demand, minimizes stockouts/holding.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

No major calendar events (summer lull for socks). Lead time consistently 0 across all 22 periods, no losses/overdues (in-transit=0). On-hand=19 low vs ~78 demand, risks stockout. Set L='default' (promised 0). mu_hat='recent_N' N=10 for (1+0)*76.6 current regime mean. sigma_hat='recent_N' N=10 for sqrt(1+0)*11.3 volatility. High profit/holding ratio implies q~0.95, parameters target base stock ~76.6 + 1.645*11.3 ~95 to balance sales vs holding, covering lead+review demand proactively.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22), late July summer; socks demand in stable lower regime since P13 (downward shift confirmed P21 carry-over, avg~76.3 P13-23 across 11 periods, sustained with P21-23:78/78/73 near prior 76.25 avg P13-20). No major calendar events for socks category. On-hand=23 low vs ~77 exp demand, in-transit=0, all past orders arrived LT=0 (consistent 23 periods, no losses/overdues). Use recent_11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained regime (N=11=max(min(11,20),3), mean~76.3, std~12-13); L=default (promised 0 confirmed). This sets base_stock~76 + z*13 (z~1.64 for q=19/20=0.95) to cover demand+buffer vs holding, backend cap irrelevant w/L=0.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29, late July summer; women's trainer socks - non-seasonal peak, stable demand expected). All observed lead times consistently 0 periods across 24 periods, matching promised; no drifts or losses (in-transit=0, on-hand=26 low vs recent ~75 demand). Demand regime stable since downward shift at P13 (carry-over: P13-20 avg76.25 std~12.8), extended to P13-24 (12 periods, avg~75.7: 61,74,76,102,76,66,86,69,78,78,73,69), recent P21-24 avg74.5 confirms no new changepoint. Use recent_N=12 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor forecast to current regime (backend: mu_hat=(1+0)*mean_last12~76, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*std_last12~20), L=default=0. This boosts base_stock to cover ~76+1.6*20~96 (q=19/20=0.95), preventing stockouts (recent ending inv low, e.g., P24=26 post-69 demand) while capping overstock (holding=1 low penalty). No overdue shipments.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05), early August summer period for women's fine-knit trainer socks; no major calendar events like back-to-school yet (typically late Aug). Demand regime stable in downward shift since P13 (carry-over Period 21), now 13 periods (P13-P25) with avg 74.7 (sum 971), std est ~17 (influenced by P16=102 but sustained). Recent P21-P25 avg 72.2 slightly lower but -5% insignificant vs prior shifts (17-48%); no new changepoint. All lead times confirmed 0 periods (P1-P25 arrives same period), no in-transit/overdues. On-hand=30 low vs ~75 expected demand. L=default (promised 0 confirmed). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_13 captures current regime for (1+0)*mean/std_last13. Sets base_stock \u224874.7 + 1.645*17\u2248103 (q=19/20=0.95 high service), order\u2248103-30=73 covers demand post-decision minimizing stockout (high profit) vs holding ($1).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12), mid-summer (August), fine-knit trainer socks likely seeing seasonally low demand due to warm weather; recent demands P23-26:73,69,63,51 confirm further downward regime shift from prior P17-22 avg75.5 (-15%). All 26 historical orders arrived with lead_time=0 (no losses/overdues, in-transit=0 confirmed). On-hand=42 covers ~1 recent period but risks stockout if demand~60+. Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained drop (regime_length=4, N=4 per guidelines), yielding mu_hat~(1+0)*64=64, sigma_hat~sqrt(1+0)*9.6\u22489.6; L=default (promised=0, matches all data). This lowers base_stock~64+1.645*9.6\u224880 (q=19/20=0.95), orders~38 to target buffer vs holding cost while reacting to drop, maximizing R_t.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further downward shift starting Period 23: avg 64 (P23-26) vs 75.5 (P17-22) (-15%), sustained 4 periods with drop to 51.

Period 28 (2019-08-19, late summer; socks demand typically lower in summer). All historical lead times confirmed at 0 periods (no drifts or losses; in-transit=0). Recent demand regime downward shift sustained P23-27: demands 73,69,63,51,64 (avg=64, std~8.3 sample); fits carry-over P27 insight (avg64 P23-26 continued by P27=64). On-hand=16 low vs ~64 demand (risk stockout this period). Use default L=0 (promised/observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 to capture sustained low-demand regime (N=5=max(min(regime_length~5,20),3)), yielding mu_hat=64, sigma_hat~sqrt(1)*8.3; supports high service (q=19/20=0.95) with low holding via recent low mean/vol.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16): Early fall, women's trainer socks; demand in sustained downward regime since P23 per carry-over (further drop to avg64 P23-26 vs prior75.5), now extended P23-31 avg=62.2 (sum=560/9 demands:73,69,63,51,64,53,69,56,62), -17% vs earlier regimes, low volatility consistent. Lead time confirmed 0 across all 31 periods (every conclude shows lead_time=0). On-hand=14 low vs ~62 expected demand, in-transit=0, no overdues/losses. Parameters use recent_9 (regime_length=9 since P23 changepoint, max(min(9,20),3)=9) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set lower base_stock reflecting current mean/vol, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding; default L=0 as actual matches promised, ensuring OR orders ~62 + safety to cover period demand post-decision.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Late September, women's trainer socks; steady fall demand expected as weather cools, no major events. Demand in downward regime since P23 (10+ periods sustained per carry-over), recent P23-32 avg=61.3 (down from prior regimes), std~7.7; on-hand=22 low vs ~61 expected demand, no in-transit, all past orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed 32x). Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current low-demand regime (regime_length=10); L=default (promised/actual=0). Parameters inform OR backend of lower mu (base_stock~61 + z*sigma, z~1.64 for q=19/20=0.95 high service) vs holding cost, preventing overstock while covering demand; cap irrelevant at L=0.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30), end of September, approaching October but no major sock-specific events (e.g., Halloween less relevant for basic trainer socks). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments\u2014all 33 prior orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0). Current demand regime downward shift sustained P23-P33 (11 periods, demands:73,69,63,51,64,53,69,56,62,53,90; avg~63.9, std~13.5), confirming prior carry-over avg~64 with added volatility from P33=90 spike (stockout occurred, sold=75<90). No new sustained changepoint (P33 uptick single period, <3). L='default' (promised=0, matches all history). mu_hat/sigma_hat='recent_N' N=11 (regime_length=11, min(11,20)=11) to forecast current low-demand regime, avoiding dilution from early highs (P7-12 ~90s). Parameters target base_stock ~63.9 + 1.645*13.5 \u224890 (q=19/20=0.95), covering recent distro/vol; OR cap further bounds overstock. Addresses stockouts (P33) vs low holdings (~20 avg recent endings).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7, early October - fall season start, fine-knit trainer socks may see mild uptick but no calendar events like holidays yet). Demand sustained in lower regime since P23 (12 periods: P23-34 demands avg 64.3, std ~13.7; vs prior P13-22 ~76), confirmed by carry-over shifts downward P21/P27, recent P30-34 avg 66 but overall regime stable low-60s post-summer peaks. No in-transit, on-hand 14 low vs expected ~64, lead time consistently 0 across all 34 periods (every order arrived same period). Use default L=0. mu_hat recent_12 captures current downward regime mean. sigma_hat recent_12 for matching volatility (lower than peak periods). Parameters inform OR backend of low demand/lead=0 for base_stock ~64 + z*13 (z high since profit 19>>holding1, q~0.95), minimizing holding on low on-hand while covering demand to max R_t.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Fine-knit trainer socks; mid-October fall transition, no immediate major events like Halloween (Oct 31) likely to spike sock demand significantly, but monitor for winter buildup. On-hand=30, in-transit=0; all historical orders arrived same-period (LT=0 confirmed across 35 periods, no losses/overdues). Demand regime downward shift from P23 sustained (P23-35: 13 periods, avg=63.5, includes recent P33=90 outlier but overall stable ~63-65 vs prior peaks 70-90); volatility moderate (prior carry-overs note std~12-22). Use recent_13 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current low-demand regime (N=max(min(13,20),3)=13), yielding mu_hat=63.5, sigma_hat=~13 (est); L=default (promised/observed 0). With q=19/20=0.95 (z~1.645), targets base_stock~63+1.6*13~84; order~84-30=54 (capped similarly), covers expected demand+buffer minimizing stockouts (high profit) while low holding on ~30-50 end-inv.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21), late October approaching Halloween but fine-knit trainer socks (cotton blend, women's socks/tights) unlikely to spike; winter demand possible but recent pattern downward sustained. On-hand 30, in-transit 0; no overdue/lost shipments\u2014all historical orders arrived same period (lead_time=0 confirmed consistently). Demand regime low since P23 changepoint (insight P27), P23-36 (14 periods): avg 62.6, std ~13 (volatile with P33=90 outlier but sustained low overall vs prior 75+). Use recent_N=14 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set mu_hat=62.6, sigma_hat=~13; with L=0, base_stock~62+1.645*13~83 (q=19/20=0.95), order~53 to cover expected demand, minimize holding on low trend while high service avoids lost sales.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28), late October approaching Halloween; product is fine-knit trainer socks (women's socks/tights), minimal seasonal impact expected (no strong holiday tie, possible minor winter ramp but no evidence). All 37 prior periods confirm consistent lead_time=0 (no drifts/losses, all arrived same period). On-hand=31 low vs recent demand ~55 (risk of stockout if >31), in-transit=0. Demand regime downward per carry-over (P23+ avg~64, sustained), recent P23-37 (15 periods) avg~62, std~15 (volatile with P33=90 spike but recent P35-37~52 low). No overdue/missing shipments. L=default (promised 0 confirmed). mu_hat=recent_N N=15 (chgpnt P23 regime length=15, (1+0)*~62 covers recent mean). sigma_hat=recent_N N=15 (matches recent vol). Adjusts OR base_stock=~62 + z*0.95*15 (~62+25=87) -31 onhand, balances high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding amid low mean/vol.

Carry-over insight: Demand further downward shift starting Period 35: avg 51.7 (P35-37) vs P27-34 avg 64.5 (-20%), sustained 3 periods with consistent 50s.

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/04, early Nov pre-Thanksgiving, no major sock demand spike expected yet; basic women's socks stable in fall). Recent demand regime low/stable P35-38: 53,52,50,51 (avg 51.5, std~1.29), confirming P38 carry-over downward shift sustained now 4 periods (-20% vs prior). On-hand=29 < recent avg, in-transit=0, L consistently 0 all 38 periods (no losses/delays). Use default L=0. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=4 to anchor low mean/volatility (backend: mu~(1+0)*51.5=51.5, sigma~1.29), base_stock~51.5 + 1.645*1.29~54 (q=19/20=0.95), order~54-29=25 to cover demand w/ safety vs holding cost, prioritizing sales.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11): Socks product entering late fall/winter pre-holiday (Thanksgiving Nov28, Black Friday Nov29); demand may dip before potential gifting spike but recent evidence shows sustained low regime. Carry-over confirms downward shift at P38 (P35-37 avg51.7 sustained 3+ periods, P38=51 extends to 4 periods ~51 avg). P39=22 (-57%) is sharp single-period drop, not sustained (requires 3+ periods). Demands P35-39: 53,52,50,51,22 (avg45.6, std~11.8), regime length=5 >=3. On-hand=32, in-transit=0, no overdue (all historical orders arrived same-period, L=0 confirmed 39x). No lost shipments. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to track recent low mean/vol (vs default all-history ~65+ higher); L=default (promised=0 matches actual). Lowers base_stock target ~46 + safety (z~1.645 for q=19/20=0.95) to cut holding on low demand, while variance buffer prevents stockout if demand reverts/up.

Prior carry-over downward regime from P35 (avg~51, sustained 4 periods then further drop). On-hand 45 covers multiple low-demand periods; in-transit=0, all historical lead times confirmed 0 (40/40 observations). Use recent_N=6 (P35-40 regime length=6, N=max(min(6,20),3)=6) for mu_hat/sigma_hat: recent avg~41.8 (vs all-history higher ~60+), std~13.7 (lower vs peaks); lowers base_stock vs default to cut holding on low demand while q=19/20=0.95 high service buffers variability/spike risk.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25, pre-Black Friday Nov29 and holiday season). Socks demand shows sustained sharp downward shift since P39 (2019/11/04): demands 22,23,25 (avg 23.3, std~1.53) vs P35-38 avg~51.75 (-55%), consistent low 20s over 3 periods, low volatility. No calendar-driven spike evident yet despite approaching holidays (trainer socks basic, not peak gift item). On-hand 42 covers multiple recent demands; in-transit 0, all past orders arrived LT=0 (no losses/overdues). Use default L=0 (confirmed consistent). recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low-demand/low-vol regime (N=3 as regime_length=3), informing OR backend for lower base_stock to minimize holding (high q~0.95 but recent mu low ~23 balances service vs cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further downward shift starting Period 39: avg 23.3 (P39-41) vs P35-38 avg 51.75 (-55%), sustained 3 periods with consistent low 20s; std dropped to ~1.5 (from prior ~10).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): Cyber Monday and early holiday season (Christmas ~3 weeks away); women's fine-knit trainer socks likely to see demand uptick for gifting/winter wear. Recent demands: P39-41 avg~23.3 (low regime per carry-over), P42=45 (+80% jump, post-Black Friday precursor). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; all 42 prior orders arrived same-period (LT=0), no losses/overdues. No new sustained changepoint (P42 uptick single period). L: default (promised/observed=0). mu_hat/sigma_hat: recent_N N=10 (P33-42 demands capture volatility: highs 90/69, 50s cluster, lows 22-25, recent 45; backend mean~48, std~21). Yields base_stock~48+1.645*21~83 (>P42 demand), high service q=19/20 prioritizes profit from sales over holding amid stockout risk and holiday anticipation.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09), approaching Christmas (Dec 25, ~16 days away). Women's fine-knit trainer socks likely see holiday/winter demand uptick (gifting, cold weather). Evidence: P42 (2019-11-25, near Black Friday 11/29) demand=45 (+82% vs P39-41 avg~23); P43=28 (+13% vs prior low). Recent P39-43 demands:22,23,25,45,28 (mean=28.6, sd=9.46), confirming low regime but with holiday volatility signal. All LT=0 confirmed (no in-transit/overdues). On-hand=56 covers ~2 recent periods. Proactive seasonal adjustment: explicit mu_hat=40 ((1+0)*blended recent 28.6 +38% holiday premium matching BF evidence + early-year winter avg~37); sigma_hat=15 (up from recent 9.5 for event vol). Yields base_stock~40+1.645*15~65, order~9 (min(65-56,cap~65)), builds buffer for spike while high q=0.95 prioritizes service over holding.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), pre-Christmas week (Dec 25 approaching); socks demand may spike due to holiday shopping/gifting, but recent P43-44 (Dec 2/9) shows 28,33 (avg 30.5, slight rise from Nov lows). Confirmed changepoint P39 downward shift (avg 23.3 P39-41 vs prior 51+, sustained 3 periods per carry-over); current regime length=6 (P39-44 demands:22,23,25,45,28,33 avg=29.3 std\u22488.6). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to match recent low regime (N=max(min(6,20),3)). L='default' (promised 0; all 44 observed LT=0, no losses/delays, in-transit=0). Parameters yield mu_hat=29.3, sigma_hat=8.6 (L=0), base_stock\u224829+1.645*8.6\u224843, order\u224843-32=11 (pipeline=32); balances low recent demand vs high service need (q=0.95), low holding risk, positions for potential holiday uptick without overstocking vs prior P43 excess.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23, Christmas Eve): expect major holiday demand spike for women's trainer socks (gifts/winter wear), confirmed by P45 (Dec 16)=81 demand (stockout, sold=44/81), P44 (Dec 9)=33, P43 (Dec 2)=28, P42 (Nov 25)=45 up from P39-41 avg~23. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline. Lead time consistently 0 across all 45 concluded periods, no losses/overdues. Changepoint: upward shift from P42 (regime length=4+ to P45), avg~47 vs prior~29 (+64%). L=default (0). mu_hat=explicit 90 to forecast holiday peak (recent 81 + Christmas Eve boost). sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 (P41-45 std~23, captures vol incl spike). Yields base_stock~90+1.65*23~128 to cover 80-100+ demand, prioritizing service (q=19/20=0.95) over low holding, avoids recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward starting Period 42 for holiday buildup: avg 46.8 (P42-45:45,28,33,81) vs P39-41 avg 23.3 (+101%), sustained 4 periods with Dec spike P45=81 (+264% prior); std up ~23.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30), post-Christmas/New Year's week for women's trainer socks; holiday demand elevated per carry-over (upward shift P42+). Recent P42-46 demands: 45,28,33,81,67 (mean 50.8, std ~22.6), regime length 5 periods, sustained high/volatility vs prior lows (P39-41 avg~23). All 46 periods lead_time=0 confirmed (no losses/overdues), in-transit=0, on-hand=61 covers expected ~51. L default (promised 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 captures recent holiday mean/vol for base_stock ~51 + 1.645*22.6 ~88 (order ~27 to pipeline 61), high service (q=0.95) vs low holding; anticipates possible NY resolution demand but anchored to data.
