No lost shipments or drifts. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no coverage for P43 demand; must order to arrive same-period before demand hits. Demand analysis: High demand regime sustained since P27 (now 16 periods to P42), avg P27-42 ~69 (+121% vs P17-26 low avg 28), extreme volatility (std~30+, range 30-175), frequent stockouts on peaks (e.g., P42 demand=175, sold=79 lost 96).
