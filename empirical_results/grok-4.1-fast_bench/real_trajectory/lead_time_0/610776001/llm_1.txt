No major events boosting apparel basics (Election Day Nov5 irrelevant). Confirms/aligns with observed sustained demand collapse since P21 (summer end). (b) Demand regime: Very low sustained per carry-over (P30-P36 avg~48, P34-P36 avg41 std~6); recent P36-P38:43,49,24 (avg~39 std~13) continues very low with downtrend/volatility; forecast P39 ~25-40 (bias low per latest 24 + seasonal). (c) Lead time: Confirmed 0 periods consistently (P38 order arrived P38); no in-transit/missing orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=38 (P38 ending), in-transit=0; covers expected P39 demand (~30) + buffer for 1 period (no pipeline risk). (e) Final order logic: Lead=0 allows perfect reaction; order conservatively ~25 to target post-demand ending ~10-20 (cover mean+low vol, minimize holding $1 vs profit $4); avoids stockout risk (recent high=49) while reducing excess ahead of 9 remaining periods' low demand.",
