Full history skewed high by early/summer peaks, recent 10+ periods confirm ~30 avg max. OR recommendation: 224 units overstates due to full-history mean (~150-200 inferred), ignoring regime shift; its base-stock for L=0 would target 1-period mu + safety ~200+, uncapped. Strategy: With lead time=0, inventory position=62 + order; target base-stock ~30 (recent mu=25 + z*sigma ~0.8*10=8); order=max(0,30-62)=0 to draw down excess, minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while covering expected demand <62; avoids stockout risk (low vol) and overstock vs OR's outdated baseline.",
