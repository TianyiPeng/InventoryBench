Date 2019-02-11 (Mon), post Chinese New Year (Feb 5) and pre-Valentine's (Feb 14) - possible gift/demand drivers explaining prior spike. Historical demand: steady 10-11/wk Jan 7-28, spike to 74 on Feb 4 (pre-holiday surge?). (b) Demand regime: Possible shift to higher mean (~74 recent vs ~11 prior), but only 1 data point - not sustained (needs 3+). Forecast for Feb 11: 30-50, weighting recent spike + winter/near-holiday lift, conservative vs pure historical mean ~23. (c) Lead time: No conclude messages yet (Period 1), promised 0; cannot infer actual. No prior orders, no missing signals. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0, in-transit 0 - zero coverage for Period 1 demand. Must order to satisfy expected D post-decision. (e) Order logic: With L=0 promised (arrives same period), order forecast D + small buffer for variance. Target 40: covers likely regime (post-spike winter/holiday), limits overstock risk (holding=profit). Adjust next period on results.",
