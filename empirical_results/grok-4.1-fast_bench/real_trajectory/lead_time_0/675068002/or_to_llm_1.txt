  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 0 periods across all 46 concluded periods (e.g., P46: ordered on 46, arrived on 46, lead_time=0), no lost shipments or delays; promised LT=0 matches actual. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=356 (from P46 ending), in-transit=0; ample for 5-7 periods at recent avg demand ~60 (P43-P46: 60,73,59,52 avg=61). Demand analysis: Post-Thanksgiving/Christmas low regime persists (carry-over P46: P43-P45 avg64; P46=52 confirms continuation into late Dec); date 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas Monday) unlikely to spike for everyday women's blouse (no New Year's clothing surge expected, unlike Thanksgiving/Black Friday peaks P38-P42 avg163). Historical initial samples irrelevant vs current low regime. OR rec=0 uses promised LT=0 and full history (mean likely pulled low by recent data), correctly targets base-stock given high inventory. Strategy: Follow OR 0 to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while 356 covers foreseeable low demand; no override needed as no regime shift or LT anomaly.",
