World knowledge: SS T-shirts face minimal demand in winter; no major holidays boosting apparel until Thanksgiving (Nov 28)/Black Friday, but not SS-specific. Seasonal decline aligns with prior fall insights (post-summer drop). (b) Demand regime: Stable low winter regime P34-39: demands [52,33,27,32,42,36] avg=37, median=34, range 27-52 (low variance ~8); sustained vs Sep avg~40 (-7%, insignificant); no rebound, confirms deepening fall/winter decline. Prior summer peaks irrelevant now. (c) Lead time: Confirmed 0 periods consistently (all P1-39 concludes show 'lead_time was 0 periods'); no in-transit or lost orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=4, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Post-P39: low ending inv reflects conservative low-demand stocking. Covers ~0.1 periods demand. (e) Final order logic: Forecast P40 demand ~37 (recent mean, stable regime). Target total avail=39 (on-hand 4 + order 35) to cover mean + minor safety (std~8); expect sell~37, end~2 (holding cost neutral vs lost profit). Matches P39 strategy (order 40 for ~37 demand).",
