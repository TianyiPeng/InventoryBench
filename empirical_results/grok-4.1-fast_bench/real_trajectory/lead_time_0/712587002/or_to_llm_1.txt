No lost shipments observed. Inventory position: On-hand=106, in-transit=0; ample coverage for multiple periods even at prior peaks (~170). Demand analysis: Sustained suppression since P8 (summer 2019), deepening through fall (P39-P41: avg~2, lows=1); P42 (Nov 25)=15 shows slight uptick (possibly pre-Black Friday), but avg P39-P42=5.25 still negligible vs early highs (P1-P7 avg~144) or uptrend (P2-P7 avg=158). Current date Dec 2, 2019: Early Christmas shopping season; women's viscose-blend trousers (everyday collection, paper-bag waist style) may see moderate rebound for holiday gifting/festive wear, but no sustained evidence (single P42 uptick insufficient per carry-over criteria). Forecast for P43: 10-25 units base, with tail risk up to 50+ if winter rebound mirrors Jan-Feb. OR recommendation (13 units): Reasonable baseline using all-history empirical mean (likely ~30-40 now, pulled down by 30+ low-demand periods) + safety for L=0; its base-stock implies ~119 target (13 + 106 pipeline), capped conservatively. Strategy: Slight override upward to 20 units - buffers potential holiday uptick (P42 precedent + seasonal logic) without excess holding risk on existing 106 (expected ending inv ~100+ regardless, but captures ~80% fractile upside); avoids stockout if demand hits 20-30 while minimizing added exposure vs OR's cautious 13.",
