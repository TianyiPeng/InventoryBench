Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11), first decision with no prior period history or conclude messages. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (5 weeks Jan-Feb 2019): 120,87,80,68,73 (mean~85.6, decreasing trend post-holidays but latest 73 on 02/04). Product is women's everyday vest top/blouse; approaching Valentine's Day (02/14) could mildly boost demand, but no evidence yet. No observed lead times (promised=0), no changepoints confirmed. Use defaults: backend will compute mu_hat=(1+0)*85.6~86, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*std~20.4 (std of samples ~20.4). This sets high service level (q=19/20=0.95) with base_stock ~86 + 1.645*20.4 ~110 to cover initial demand while minimizing holding risk.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18, Presidents' Day - major US retail holiday with potential apparel demand spike). Observed P1 demand=91 (up from prior week 73 on 02-04, +24%), but single period lacks sustained evidence for regime shift (prior trend declining from 120 to 73 over 5 weeks). Historical demands (6 total): mean ~86.5, std ~18.5. Lead time confirmed 0 periods from P1 order (arrived same period). IP=29+0=29 low vs expected ~90; defaults yield base_stock ~86 + 1.645*18.5 ~116, order ~87 (min cap), provides high service (q=19/20=0.95) balancing profit vs low holding. Proactive holiday anticipation covered by safety stock; no adjustments needed yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), late February, women's spaghetti strap vest top (spring-appropriate, everyday blouses). On-hand=11 (low), in-transit=0 (no pipeline). Recent demands: P1 (2/11)=91, P2 (2/18)=106 (avg=98.5, uptrend +15 from P1); historical mean=85.6 (120,87,80,68,73). Seasonal demand rise likely as spring nears (post-Valentine's, pre-spring collections). Lead times confirmed 0 periods both P1 (arrived P1) and P2 (arrived P2), no missing shipments. Changepoint evidence: demand shift up since P1 (+15% vs hist mean, +28%/+45% vs last hist 73), validated by 2 periods + calendar seasonality. L=default (promised/confirmed 0). mu_hat=explicit 105 ((1+0)*105: recent avg 98.5 + upward/seasonal adjustment for ~100+ demand). sigma_hat=default (hist std~20.5 conservative vs recent ~10.6; adds safety). Ensures backend base_stock ~105 + 1.645*20.5 ~138 (q=19/20=0.95), order~127 vs low 11 on-hand, covers demand + safety, prioritizes service (high profit/low hold) vs stockout risk.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, women's everyday V-neck blouse/vest top; no major holidays nearby (post-Valentine's, pre-spring events), steady non-seasonal demand expected. Lead times consistently 0 periods over 3 observed (P1-P3 orders arrived same period), no in-transit or losses; on-hand 45 low vs expected ~95 demand (risk of stockout). Observed demands: P1=91, P2=106, P3=91 (recent mean=96, std\u22488.7); historical 5 samples mean\u224885.6, std\u224820.5. Changepoint post-2019-02-04: demand shifted up ~12% with lower volatility, sustained 3 periods. L=default (confirmed 0). mu_hat=explicit 96 to reflect recent regime mean for 1-period (L+1) horizon. sigma_hat=explicit 9 to capture recent low vol, ensuring high service (q=19/20=0.95) while minimizing holding; overrides backend's historical bias for better balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-2019-02-04: avg 96 over P1-P3 (+12% vs historical mean 85.6; +31% vs last hist 73), lower std 8.7 vs hist 20.5, sustained 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Women's V-neck top, early March, no major holidays; recent demand regime shift confirmed higher mean ~98 (P1-4: 91,106,91,104) vs historical ~86 (+14%), low std ~7 vs hist 20.5. On-hand 7 low, in-transit 0; all prior orders arrived same-period (L=0 confirmed 4x, no losses). Use recent_4 for mu/sigma to capture sustained high-demand low-vol regime over (1+0)=1 period, balancing high service for profit vs low holding; default L as consistent with promised/observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand high mean sustained P1-4 avg98 (+14% vs hist), low std~7 vs hist20.5

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18, early spring): Women's everyday V-neck blouse/vest top; no major holidays imminent (St. Patrick's past). Demand regime: sustained high mean ~97 (P1-5: 91,106,91,104,93; avg97, +13% vs hist85.6), low std~6.5 (vs hist20.5); changepoint post-hist last (73), regime_length=5 periods confirmed. Inventory: on-hand=19, in-transit=0; all prior orders arrived LT=0 as promised (P1-5 concludes). No overdue/losses. L=default (promised 0, all observed LT=0). mu_hat=recent_N N=5: (1+0)*mean(P1-5)=97, covers elevated demand. sigma_hat=recent_N N=5: sqrt(1+0)*std(P1-5)~6.5, matches low vol to minimize overstock. Balances high service (q~0.95) vs holding by targeting recent stable regime, preventing stockouts on higher mean while avoiding excess given low variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $870.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), late March spring; women's spaghetti strap vest top (summer-ish everyday blouse) \u2013 demand may vary seasonally toward warmer weather, no major holidays imminent (Easter 4/21). Inventory: on-hand=61, in-transit=0; all prior orders (P1-6) arrived same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed consistently, no losses/overdues). Demands: P1-5 high avg~97 low std~6 (per carry-over regime), but P6=49 sharp drop (-50% vs recent avg) \u2013 single-period signal, not yet sustained changepoint. Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to incorporate full history (mean~89, std~21, similar to hist std 20.5), L=default (0). This sets mu_hat=89, sigma_hat~21; with high q=19/20=0.95 (z~1.65), base_stock~89+35=124, order~63 (after -61 pipeline) balances service vs holding, cautious on recent drop without overreacting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1116.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8, date 2019/4/1 (early spring). Vest top (lightweight blouse) likely seeing seasonal demand decline into warmer weather. Demands: P1-5 avg97 (high, as per carry-over), P6=49/P7=62 (avg55.5, -43% drop, possible regime shift but only 2 periods, not sustained 3+). All-time game avg P1-7=85.1 (matches hist mean 85.6). On-hand=62 (from P7 ending), in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments\u2014all 7 orders arrived LT=0 (confirmed via conclude messages: each 'lead_time was 0 periods'). No LT issues. Use default L (promised 0, matches all observed). recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to weight full game history (smooths recent drop without overreacting), backend computes mu_hat=1*mean(last7)~85, sigma_hat=1*std(last7)~30 (rough). With q=19/20=0.95 (z~1.65), base_stock~85+50=135; orders min(135-62-0, cap~100), targets ~70-75 units to cover expected demand, prioritizing sales (high profit) over holding.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring, women's vest top/blouse (light upper body garment suitable for warming weather). Easter on 4/21 may drive upcoming demand uptick (P8=114 high). Demands P1-8: 91,106,91,104,93,49,62,114 (avg 88.75, std~22). Early P1-5 stable high avg~97 low std~6 (per carry-over); P6-8 volatile avg75 std~34 (mean -23%, std +450%). Lead time confirmed 0 all 8 periods (no in-transit/overdues). On-hand 7 low, pipeline 7 total. Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to incorporate full game history (no stronger recent regime for N=3); scales to (1+0)=1 period demand forecast ~89 + safety. L default (confirmed 0). Balances high profit:holding ratio (q=0.95) with recent volatility, avoiding stockouts on rebound.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: mean dropped to 75 avg P6-8 (-23% vs P1-5 97), std increased to ~34 vs ~6 (+450%), sustained 3 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15, mid-April, pre-Easter on 04-21); vest top (spaghetti straps) aligns with spring warming, potential demand uptick near Easter but recent pattern dominates. On-hand=41, in-transit=0; all P1-9 orders arrived LT=0 (no losses/overdues). Demand regime shift at P6 sustained P6-9 (4 periods): mean=77.5 (-20% vs P1-5=97), std~25 (vs early ~7), volatile (49,62,114,85). L=default (confirmed LT=0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 captures lower mean/higher vol regime (N=max(min(regime_length=4,20),3)). Lowers base stock vs early periods to cut holding costs (ending inv often high early), high sigma + z~(1.645 for q=19/20=0.95) buffers vol/service for profit.

Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter Monday; women's everyday V-neck blouse/vest top - no major seasonal or holiday demand driver expected (Easter yesterday unlikely to spike everyday apparel). LT consistently 0 across all 10 concluded periods (no in-transit, no losses). On-hand 26 low vs expected demand ~80-100. Demand changepoint at P6 confirmed sustained to P10 (5 periods): mean 81.8 (P6-10:49,62,114,85,99) vs prior P1-5 97 (-16%), std 26.5 vs prior ~6.5 (high volatility persisted). Use recent_N N=5 (regime_length=5) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect recent lower mean/higher std regime; scales to (1+0) periods. L default (promised 0 confirmed). Parameters yield base_stock ~82 + 1.645*26.5 \u2248126 (q=19/20=0.95), orders ~126 covering demand+safety, minimizing stockout risk (high profit) while capping hold cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29), late spring for women's V-neck vest top (summer-appropriate, seasonal demand rise likely post-winter). Easter (4/21) may explain P11 spike (121). On-hand=5 low, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments\u2014all P1-11 lead times confirmed 0 periods. Demands: P9-11 (85,99,121) avg=102 (+36% vs P6-8 avg75), std~18 (down from P6-8 ~34); sustained 3 periods post-P8, signaling regime shift up from carry-over P6-8 drop. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture higher mean/volatility (backend: mu_hat=102, sigma_hat=18); L=default (0, matches all obs). q=19/20=0.95, z~1.645 \u2192 base_stock~102+1.645*18~132, order~127 post-onhand deduct, covers demand peak vs low hold cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: mean increased to 102 avg P9-11 (+36% vs P6-8 75), std decreased to ~18 vs ~34 (-47%), sustained 3 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6, early May, spring/summer transition for lightweight V-neck spaghetti strap top; no immediate holidays like Mother's Day 5/12 driving spike yet). On-hand=56 (from P12 end), in-transit=0; all 12 prior orders arrived same-period (LT=0 confirmed consistently, no losses/overdues). Demands: recent P9-12 (85,99,121,76) avg=95.25 (+27% vs P6-8 regime avg75), std~19.7 (matches carry-over P9-11 std~18, lower than prior ~34); regime from P9 sustained 4 periods despite P12 dip (not a new changepoint, single period <3 sustained). Overall mean~95.9. Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target current higher-mean/lower-var regime ((1+0)*95.25 mu, sqrt(1)*19.7 sigma), ensuring high service (q=19/20=0.95, z~1.645) covers ~114 base_stock vs on-hand56 for volatile demand, minimizing stockouts (high profit) while low holding.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13), women's V-neck spaghetti strap top (summer-ish garment). Post-Mother's Day (May 12), potential demand impact but P13 demand=52 low. Recent demands volatile: P9-13 (85,99,121,76,52) avg=86.6 (down from P9-11 avg102 noted in carry-over), std~25.7 high vs earlier regimes. Overall P1-13 mean~88. Lead time consistently 0 periods (all 13 concludes confirm), no in-transit/overdues, on-hand=76 covers expected ~85-90 + volatility but risks stockout if spike like P11=121. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to weight post-P9 regime (length=5 periods, N=max(min(5,20),3)=5), L=default (promised=0 confirmed). This lowers mu_hat vs all-time (~88), raises service for recent vol to balance profit/holding; backend base_stock ~86.6 + 1.645*25.7 ~130, covers demand+buffer w/ cap consideration.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20): Late spring/early summer; product is lightweight V-neck spaghetti strap blouse suitable for warm weather, but demand dropping sharply. All historical lead times confirmed at 0 periods (no drifts/losses; latest P14 order arrived same period). Demands: P12-14 (76,52,54) show new low-demand regime (mean=60.7, -40% vs P9-11 avg102; std~13 vs prior~18), sustained 3 periods\u2014changenpoint at P12 post-P11's 121. On-hand=75 covers ~1+ period of recent demand; in-transit=0, no overdues. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target low recent mean/volatility over (1+0)=1 period, balancing high profit vs holding by avoiding overstock. L=default (confirmed 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: mean dropped to 61 avg P12-14 (-40% vs P9-11 102), std ~13 vs ~18 (-28%), sustained 3 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, Memorial Day - potential demand driver for summer lightweight V-neck spaghetti strap top, but no spike evident yet). Recent low demand regime since P12 confirmed: P12-15 demands [76,52,54,55], avg=59.25 (-40% vs prior P9-11 avg102), low std~11.3 (sample std). All historical LT=0 confirmed (15 observations), no in-transit/overdues, on-hand=28 sufficient for ~1 period low demand but order needed proactively. Use default L=0 (promised/matches all data). recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target low regime mean/variance over review+lead=1 period, ensuring base_stock~59 + 1.645*11~83 (q=19/20=0.95), balancing high service vs low holding on summer seasonal risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime sustained P12-15: avg59 (-3% vs P12-14 61), std~11 vs prior~18, now 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03, early summer): Women's vest top (light everyday blouse); low seasonal demand expected as summer starts, no major events nearby. Low demand regime sustained P12-16: demands [76,52,54,55,57], avg=58.8 (-40% vs prior P9-11 avg102), std~9.8 (sample) vs prior~18, now 5 periods confirming stability. All historical lead times=0 (17 concludes), no in-transit/overdues. On-hand=21 low vs ~59 forecast, risks stockout. L=default (promised 0 confirmed). mu_hat=recent_5 captures low mean*1. sigma_hat=recent_5 for low vol. Ensures base_stock ~59 + safety, orders to cover demand minus pipeline (0), minimizing hold cost ($1) vs profit ($19), high service in low regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime sustained P12-16: avg58.8 (-3% vs P12-15 59), std~9.8 vs prior~13-18, now 5 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17, mid-June summer). Summer-appropriate lightweight V-neck spaghetti strap top likely seeing seasonal demand upturn: May demands ~52-57 (P13-16), June P17:41 (possible dip), P18:72 (+73% vs P17), breaking 6-period low regime (P12-17 avg~59). On-hand critically low at 3, in-transit 0, no overdue/missing shipments\u2014all 18 prior orders arrived LT=0 as promised. No pipeline to cover P19 demand. Changepoint evidence: P18 uptick signals potential summer shift, supported by product seasonality and calendar (June warmth boosts lightweight tops). L: default (confirmed LT=0 across all periods). mu_hat: explicit 85\u2014direct forecast blending recent uptick (72), prior regime avg~80, hist mean 85.6, and summer boost expectation. sigma_hat: explicit 25\u2014to account for regime-shift volatility (overall game std~28, recent~20, hist 20.5), ensuring robust base_stock ~85 + 1.645*25 \u2248123 covering (1+0) periods demand post-low inventory.

Ensures high base stock ~310 (z~1.645 for q=19/20=0.95) covers demand+LT=1 period, minimizing stockouts (high profit) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: mean increased to 160 avg P18-20 (+170% vs P12-17 ~59), std ~91 vs prior ~10 (+800%), sustained 3 periods; summer seasonal peak confirmed for vest top (Jun-Jul spike evident).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8): Mid-summer peak for women's vest top (spaghetti strap V-neck, ideal for hot weather); carry-over confirms Jun-Jul spike with demand regime shift at P18 (avg P18-21: (72+154+254+166)/4=161.5, +170% vs P12-17 ~59), high std ~80 (P18-20 ~91, slightly lower with P21=166). Regime length=4 periods (P18-21), no new changepoint. L=0 consistent across all 21 periods (every order arrived same period, no in-transit or losses). On-hand=144 from P21 excess, but recent max 254 risks stockout. Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high mean/volatility (backend: mu_hat=1*161.5, sigma_hat=1*~80); L default=0 ensures OR uses correct pipeline=0. High q=19/20=0.95 targets ~95% service, balancing profit vs holding amid volatile peak demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15, mid-summer): Vest top in high summer demand regime per carry-over (P18+ spike confirmed, avg P18-22=151 vs prior low ~59, +170%). Recent demands P18-22:72,154,254,166,109 (5-period regime, no new changepoint; post-P20 decline trend 254->166->109 but avg still high 151, sustained high vs lows). All historical lead times=0 (no drifts/losses, in-transit=0). On-hand=176 covers expected ~150 demand. Use default L=0 (matches all observed). mu_hat recent_5 captures high mean regime (backend:1*151). sigma_hat recent_5 captures elevated volatility ~69 (backend:1*69). Sets base_stock~151 + 1.645*69 ~265; order~265-176=89 (reasonable, balances service vs holding; cap safe).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22), late July, still in confirmed summer seasonal peak for vest top (light summer garment, Jun-Jul spike). Recent demand regime from P18 changepoint sustained 6 periods (P18-P23: demands 72,154,254,166,109,122; mean~146 +70% vs pre-P18 ~59, high std~63 vs prior low ~10). No new changepoint: last 3 periods avg~132 (-15% vs P18-20 160) not sustained drop amid volatility. Lead time consistently 0 across all 23 periods, no losses/overdues, in-transit=0. On-hand=142 sufficient for ~120 recent demand but risks stockout on high-vol days (e.g., P20=254). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated mean/volatility over review+lead=1 period; L=default (promised 0 confirmed). This raises base_stock ~146 + 1.645*63 ~257 (q=19/20=0.95), balancing high service for profit vs holding on 142 inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29), late July, summer peak for women's vest top ongoing (Jun-Jul spike confirmed in carry-over). Demand regime high since P18 shift: P18-24 demands [72,154,254,166,109,122,180], mean=151 (+157% vs pre-P18 avg~58), high std~58 (vs prior low ~10), sustained 7 periods with volatility (peak 254). On-hand=70 low vs recent ~150-180, in-transit=0, no pipeline. All 24 periods confirm L=0 (no lost/delayed shipments). Set L= default (promised 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat= recent_N N=7 (regime_length=7, max(min(7,20),3)=7) to capture high mean/volatility, ensuring base_stock ~151 + 1.645*58 \u2248260 covers demand (q=19/20=0.95 high service), order~260-70=190 balances profit vs holding on expected high sales.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5), early August post-summer peak for women's vest top (summer apparel). Recent demands P21-25: 166,109,122,180,112 (avg 137.8, std ~33), volatile high mean post-Jun/Jul spike (carry-over confirmed). P25=112 drop from P24=180 but single point, no sustained changepoint (needs 3+ periods). All historical lead times=0 (25 confirms, no in-transit/missing). On-hand=136 covers ~1 period expected demand. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent regime (regime_length>=5, high mean/vol), L=default (promised/observed 0). Parameters target base_stock ~138 + 1.645*33 ~192 (q=19/20=0.95), order ~56 to avoid stockout while minimizing hold cost; backend cap irrelevant as conservative.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12, mid-August), women's summer vest top; post-summer peak taper evident as season ends (Jun-Jul highs P19-24 up to 254, now declining). Confirmed prior summer spike P18+ (insight P21), new changepoint at P23: demand mean 124 avg P23-26 (122,180,112,83) vs P18-22 avg151 (-18%), std~36 sustained high vs low prior regimes; 4 periods evidence. Regime length=4, so recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat: backend computes mu_hat=1*124.25, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*~36; with q=19/20=0.95 z~1.64, base_stock~124+59=183, order~183-(109+0)=74 balancing high service (avoid lost sales like P20) vs low holding, adapts to taper without overordering. All LT=0 confirmed (26/26 periods), no losses/overdues, in-transit=0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: mean decreased to 124 avg P23-26 (-18% vs P18-22 avg151), std ~36 sustained high, 4 periods; post-summer taper confirmed for vest top (late Jul-early Aug decline evident).

LLM Rationale:

Recent demands P23-27:122,180,112,83,56 (mean~110.6, downtrend -18% avg drop per period); regime length=5 since P23 changepoint. All historical lead times=0 (27/27 observations), no losses/overdues, in-transit=0, on-hand=136 high vs recent/low demand (covers ~2+ periods). Use L default (promised=0 confirmed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 to capture sustained taper regime (N=5=max(min(5,20),3)), lowers base stock to match declining mean/volatility, balancing service (q~19/20=0.95) vs holding costs on excess inv.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26): Late August, early fall transition; vest top (summer garment with spaghetti straps) in continued post-summer demand taper/decline phase. Recent demands P25-28 (2019-07-29 to 08-19): 112,83,56,59; avg 77.5 (-37% vs prior post-summer P23-26 avg124), std ~23 (down from ~36), changepoint at P25 with 4-period sustained low regime confirming seasonal decline into late summer/early fall. On-hand 129 ample vs expected ~78 demand (low stockout risk), in-transit 0, no overdue/missing shipments (all 28 periods confirmed lead_time=0). Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low (1+0)\xd777.5 mean and scaled low vol, yielding conservative base_stock ~77.5 + 1.645\xd723 \u2248120 (q=19/20=0.95), order ~0 after subtracting on-hand, minimizing holding costs on excess while covering tapered demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: mean decreased to 78 avg P25-28 (-37% vs P23-26 avg124), std ~23 vs prior ~36 (-36%), sustained 4 periods; late summer/early fall decline confirmed for vest top.

P29 demand=54 continues decline (now P25-29: 112,83,56,59,54 avg72.8 std~25, 5 periods sustained). No in-transit, on-hand=75 covers recent ~50-70 demand. All historical lead times=0 (29 confirms, no losses). No new changepoint (further drop not yet sustained 3+ periods beyond prior). Use recent_N=5 (regime_length=5 since P25 changepoint) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect current low mean/volatility; L=default (promised 0 confirmed). Lowers base stock to minimize holding costs on declining seasonal demand while covering ~73 demand over 1 period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16, mid-Sept early fall): Vest top demand in sustained collapse as seasonal shift to cooler weather; recent P29-31 demands 54/38/26 avg 39.3 (-50% vs P25-28 regime avg 78), std~14 (low vol); on-hand 85 covers >2 periods low demand, in-transit 0, no pipeline gaps. Lead time confirmed 0 across all 31 periods (every conclude shows 'lead_time was 0'). Changepoint at P29 (3-period low regime). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target low mu~39/sigma~14 over 1+L=1 period; default L=0. Backend base_stock~39+1.645*14~62 < current 85, triggers low/no order to draw down inventory vs holding cost while high q=19/20=0.95 service covers vol.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: mean dropped to 39 avg P29-31 (-50% vs P25-28 avg78), std ~14 vs prior ~23 (-39%), sustained 3 periods; early fall demand collapse confirmed for vest top (Sep demands 54,38,26).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23), early fall for women's vest top; seasonal early fall demand collapse confirmed in carry-over (P29-31 avg39, std14; P32 demand=20 sustains low regime now 4 periods: P29-32 demands 54,38,26,20 avg=34.5 (-12% vs prior avg39), std~15 (-7% vs ~14, still low vol). No changepoint yet as decline sustains prior low regime (no 3+ period reversal). Lead times consistently 0 across all 32 periods (no in-transit, no losses). On-hand=65 covers ~2 periods low demand (34.5*2=69); order low to minimize holding. Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained fall regime (length=4>=3); L=default=0 (observed avg=0). Parameters target low base_stock ~34.5 + z*15 (q=19/20=0.95, z~1.64 \u2192 ~60), order min(60-65,cap)=0, balances high service vs low holding in low-demand fall.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=11 low, in-transit=0, no pipeline or overdue (all historical LT=0 confirmed). Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low mu_hat~(1+0)*38.4=38.4, sigma_hat~sqrt(1+0)*std~17 (backend-computed low vol), with L=default=0; adjusts OR for low base_stock to match seasonal decline, minimize holding on excess while high q=19/20=0.95 ensures service vs vol, preventing stockouts on current low inv.

Daily Reward (R_t): $375.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7, early October, fall season). Vest top demand remains in low fall regime post-summer collapse (carry-over P29+), sustained P29-34: demands [54,38,26,20,54,22], avg=35.7 (-50%+ vs summer peaks ~150), std\u224814.2 (low vs summer ~90). No upcoming events to spike light vest demand (Halloween irrelevant). On-hand=43 covers ~1-2 weeks low demand; in-transit=0, no overdue (all historical LT=0 confirmed). L=default (promised/observed=0). mu_hat=recent_6 (regime_length=6>=3, captures low mean). sigma_hat=recent_6 (low vol). Parameters lower base_stock vs all-data (mean~90), minimizing holding on low-demand inventory while high q=19/20=0.95 ensures service.

Carry-over insight: Demand low fall regime extended P29-34: avg35.7 std14.2 sustained 6 periods (+100% length vs prior 3-period note), P33 anomaly (54) but overall collapse holds into early Oct.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Mid-October, women's vest top (spaghetti strap V-neck) in deep fall regime; seasonal decline confirmed with low demands sustained P29-35: 54,38,26,20,54,22,11 (avg 32.4, std ~19), extending prior low fall collapse (avg35.7 std14.2 P29-34). On-hand 51 covers ~1.5 periods of recent demand; in-transit 0, no pipeline or overdue shipments. All historical lead times exactly 0 periods (36 observations). Changepoint at P29 (7-period regime length). Use recent_7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target low mean/volatility, ensuring base stock ~32 + safety for q~0.95 while minimizing holding on excess 51 units. L default (promised 0 matches all data).

Carry-over insight: Demand low fall regime extended P29-35: avg32.4 std~19 (-9% vs P29-34 35.7), sustained 7 periods (+17% length), P33(54)/P35(11) volatile but overall collapse holds into mid-Oct.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21): Mid-fall, women's vest top (light spaghetti strap V-neck) in sustained low demand regime since P29 (early Sep), confirmed by carry-over insights (P29-36: 8 periods, recent avg~(54+38+26+20+54+22+11+11)/8=29.5, std~18 matching prior ~19). No in-transit, on-hand=50 covers ~2 periods at recent low demand (~11-54, avg29). Lead time consistently 0 across all 36 periods (every conclude: 'lead_time was 0 periods'), no losses. Use L='default' (promised 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat='recent_N' N=8 (regime_length=8 since P29 changepoint, max(min(8,20),3)=8) to lower base_stock to ~29+1.645*18~53 (q=19/20=0.95), matching low demand vs all-history mean~85, avoids excess holding on 50 on-hand while preventing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand low fall regime extended P29-36: avg29.5 std~18 sustained 8 periods (-9% vs prior avg32.4), P36(11) confirms collapse holds into late Oct.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28, late Oct, Halloween week but vest top/spaghetti strap blouse not event-driven; deep fall decline for warm-weather garment). Low fall regime sustained P29-37 (9 periods): demands [54,38,26,20,54,22,11,11,16], avg=28 (-5% vs prior P29-36 ~29.5), std~17 (stable vs prior ~18), P33(54) anomaly but collapse holds (early fall avg drop -50% confirmed). On-hand=43 covers ~1.5 periods demand (post-demand ending ~15, low holding risk). In-transit=0; all 37 prior orders arrived L=0 (no losses/overdues). Use recent_N N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low mean/volatility regime (backend: mu_hat=1*28=28, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*17~17); L=default (promised/actual=0). High q=19/20=0.95 favors coverage of volatile low demand without overstock.

Carry-over insight: Demand low fall regime extended P29-37: avg28 std~17 sustained 9 periods (-5% mean, stable std vs prior), P37(16) confirms collapse into late Oct.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4, early Nov): Women's spaghetti-strap vest top in fall/winter low-demand season; prior summer peak (Jun-Jul) collapsed Sep-Oct, P38 demand=20 fits ongoing low fall regime (P29-38: 10 periods, avg~27.2, std~22). On-hand=36 covers ~1.3 periods at recent avg (no in-transit, no overdue arrivals). All 38 periods confirm actual LT=0 (consistent 'lead_time was 0'). Use default L=0; recent_10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low base stock matching sustained low mean/volatility regime (N=10=max(min(regime_length=10,20),3)), balancing high profit($19) vs low holding($1) by avoiding overstock while covering current demand post-decision.

Carry-over insight: Demand low fall regime extended P29-38: avg27.2 std~22 sustained 10 periods (-3% vs P29-37 avg28, std stable+29% due P38 fit), early Nov(20) confirms collapse holds.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11, mid-Nov), women's vest top (light summer garment) in prolonged low fall regime P29-39 (11 periods): demands [54,38,26,20,54,22,11,11,16,20,8], avg~25.5 (-6% vs prior P29-38 avg27), std~21 (stable vs prior~22), sustained collapse into winter transition confirmed, no demand uptick or holiday boost yet (Thanksgiving late Nov). On-hand=46 covers ~2 periods low demand (~25), in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical lead_times=0 confirmed). No new changepoint; use recent_N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor OR backend on low regime mean/volatility (base_stock~25 + 1.645*21~60, given q=19/20=0.95; on-hand=46 implies low order to minimize $1 holding vs $19 profit).

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18, mid-Nov): Women's vest top (light spaghetti strap V-neck) in sustained low winter demand regime P29-40 (2019/9/2 to 11/11), 12 periods avg demand=23.75 (sum=285/12), std~17.7 (further collapse evident: P39=8, P40=5 avg=6.5; prior P29-38 avg~27). No seasonal uplift expected (cold weather suppresses light tops; Black Friday ~P42 unlikely for this SKU). All historical LT=0 confirmed (no in-transit/overdues/losses). On-hand=48 covers ~10+ periods at recent low rates (48/23.75~2 review+LT periods excess). Pipeline=48. Use L=default (promised/observed=0); mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=12 (regime_length=12>3, captures low mean/var vs all-hist ~85 mean/high var). Low params yield base_stock~23.8+1.645*17.7~52 (q=19/20=0.95), order~min(52-48,cap)=4 low to minimize holding ($1/period) while covering low demand/service.

Carry-over insight: Demand low fall/winter regime extended P29-40: avg23.8 std~17.7 sustained 12 periods (-6% mean vs P29-39 25.5, P38-40 avg11 std~7.6 confirming deepening winter collapse).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Late Nov pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday, but vest top (light V-neck spaghetti strap) irrelevant to winter holidays; low winter demand sustained. Low fall/winter regime P29-41 avg~22.7 std~17 (13 periods), no LT drift (all 0 confirmed). Deepening bottom since P35 (demands 11,11,16,20,8,5,10 avg11.6 std~5, 7 periods sustained >3, -49% vs P29-34 avg36). On-hand 42 + in-transit 0 covers >> recent demand ~10; no overdues/losses. recent_N N=7 captures deepening low mu/sigma for base_stock ~11.6 + 1.645*5 ~20 (low holding vs profit), expects order=0 balancing costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand low fall/winter regime extended P29-41 avg22.7 std~17 sustained 13 periods (-5% mean vs P29-40); deepening winter bottom P35-41 avg11.6 std~5 sustained 7 periods (-50% vs P29-34 avg36, P41=10 confirms no holiday spike for vest top).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2, early Dec post-Thanksgiving/Black Friday week). Vest top in winter: low demand expected, no holiday spike confirmed for light summer garment. Low fall/winter regime sustained P29-42 (14 periods, avg~24, volatile std~23 due P33=54/P42=41 outliers possibly event-driven). On-hand=1, in-transit=0, no pipeline/overdues (lead time consistently 0). Use recent_N=14 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current low regime (changeloint P29 per carry-over, length=14); L=default (promised/observed=0). This sets mu_hat~24, sigma_hat~23 (1+L=1 scaling), yielding high service base_stock~24+1.645*23~62 to cover vol/service (q=19/20=0.95) vs low holding, preventing stockouts while limiting excess in low-demand winter.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9, early-mid Dec pre-Christmas week). Vest top (light summer wear) in deepening winter low demand regime per carry-over (P29-41 avg22.7 std17, P35-41 avg11.6 std5 no holiday spike), but recent changepoint at P42: demand spiked to avg34.5 P42-43 (41 Thanksgiving week Nov25-Dec1, 28 Cyber Monday week Dec2; +200% vs P35-41 11.6), std~15.6; potential holiday shopping uptick (2 periods). All historical lead times confirmed 0 (43 periods, no losses/missing, in-transit=0). On-hand=24 from P43 end (no overdue).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16, mid-Dec pre-Christmas week). Vest top (summer/light garment) in sustained deep winter low-demand regime per carry-over (P29-44 ~16 periods, prior deepening P35-41 avg11.6). Recent demands: P44=3, P43=28, P42=41 (volatile avg24, but P44 drop confirms no holiday spike/buildup). On-hand=49 covers 3+ periods at ~15-20 demand (holding cost low at $1 but minimize). In-transit=0, all past orders arrived LT=0 (no losses/drift). L=default (promised 0 confirmed). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_10 (P35-44: demands [11,11,16,20,8,5,10,41,28,3], avg15.3 std~14; captures deepening low regime length>10, ignores older fall highs; N=min(16regime,20)=10 conservative). Params yield low base_stock~15+1.645*14~38 < on-hand49 \u2192 order~0, balances high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding by underordering in low regime.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23, Christmas week). Vest top (spaghetti strap V-neck, summery/lightwear) in deep winter low demand regime per carry-over (P29-41 avg~24-11 deepening bottom), but changepoint at P42: demands P42-45=41,28,3,56 (avg32 +180% vs P35-41 avg11.6; std~22.5 +350% vs prior~5), sustained 4 periods with holiday volatility (P42 Thanksgiving week 41, P45 pre-Christmas 56, stockout lost ~7 units). No overdue/missing shipments (all historical lead_times=0 confirmed, in-transit=0, on-hand=0). L=default (promised 0 consistent). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 (regime_length=4, N=max(min(4,20),3)) yields mu_hat=32, sigma_hat~22.5; base_stock~32+1.645*22.5~69 covers 95%ile recent vol (beats P45 high 56), minimizes stockouts (profit$19>>holding$1) while avoiding excess hold on non-holiday item.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: mean 32 avg P42-45 (+180% vs P35-41 11.6), std~22.5 (+350% vs prior~5), sustained 4 periods; late Nov/Dec holiday volatility confirmed for vest top (P42 Thanksgiving 41, P45 pre-Christmas 56).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas/New Year's Eve; vest top (summer-ish garment) in holiday tail volatility regime per carry-over (P42 Thanksgiving 41, P45 pre-Xmas 56). Recent P42-46 demands: 41,28,3,56,29 (avg 31.4, std ~19.5), sustained 5 periods vs deep winter P35-41 avg11.6 (-50% prior shift reversed). On-hand 40 (covers ~1.3 recent avg), no in-transit/overdues (all LT=0 confirmed across 46 periods, no losses). No new LT changepoint. Use L default (promised/observed 0); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture sustained holiday volatility regime (N=5=max(min(5,20),3)), informing OR base_stock ~31+1.645*20=64 for q=19/20=0.95 service, order~24 to buffer volatility/stockouts (e.g., P45 lost 7), minimize holding on low-demand winter tail.

Carry-over insight: Demand holiday volatility regime extended P42-46: avg 31.4 std~19.5 sustained 5 periods (+25% length vs P42-45), P46=29 post-Christmas confirms elevated hold vs deep winter avg11.6.
