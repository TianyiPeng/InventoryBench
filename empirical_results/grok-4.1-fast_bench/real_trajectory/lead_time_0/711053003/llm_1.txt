(b) Demand regimes: Early high shift (P1-3 avg97 +200% vs hist), summer peak (P16-18 avg184 +87%, incl Memorial Day 243); fall (P29-38) volatile avg~159 (highs 259/214/185, lows 87/95), last 6 P33-38 avg133\u2014no sustained new regime (mixed highs/lows, no 3+ periods consistent decline). Forecast P39 ~120-140 blending recent avg133 and seasonal pullback. (c) Lead time confirmed 0 periods consistently (all 38 concludes: e.g., P38 order arrived P38); no in-transit, no missing orders. (d) On-hand=54 (from P38 end), in-transit=0; low stock exposes to stockout risk given volatility/spikes. Pipeline empty. 8 periods left (/47). (e) Order ~130 (recent avg133 -54 on-hand +safety ~20 for variance/decline risk); targets ~184 total inv for expected 130-140 demand, modest ending inv (~40-50) at $1 holding (symmetric to profit).
