Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), first period for women's everyday skinny jeans (steady demand category, no immediate holidays). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no prior game history or conclude messages. Historical demands stable (5 samples: mean~61.6, std~8.4, no changepoints). Use defaults: L=promised 0; mu_hat=(1+0)*historical mean for base stock over review+lead; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*historical std for safety stock. Balances service (q=19/(19+1)=0.95) vs holding with initial forecast.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18), post-Valentine's Day (Feb 14, during/after Period 1). Period 1 demand=93 >> historical mean=61.6 (samples: 74,54,54,58,68; std~8.4), likely one-off spike (+51%) for women's skinny jeans around holiday (+37% from prior 68). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time confirmed=0 (Period 1 order arrived same period). No sustained changepoint (1 period only). Set L=default (promised/confirmed 0). mu_hat=EWMA_gamma gamma=0.3 to blend recent high (93) with history (~71 vs default 62), raising base stock ~75-85 (z~1.65 for q=0.95) to cut stockout risk (lost 16 sales prior) while avoiding excess hold post-spike. sigma_hat=default (historical vol stable). Balances high profit service vs low hold cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), late February, women's skinny jeans (everyday collection). Recent demands: P1=93, P2=81 (avg 87, +40% vs historical avg 62), indicating higher demand regime starting P1 (changepoint after 2019-02-04 demand=68). Historical samples stable ~54-74. On-hand=29 (low vs ~85 expected demand), in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Lead times confirmed 0 periods (P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2). No calendar events driving spike (post-Valentine's). Use recent_N=2 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent regime (N=2 as regime_length=2, prioritizing recency over min 3). L default (promised/confirmed 0). Parameters target base_stock ~87 + 1.645*std_recent~95, order ~95-29=66 (covers demand, balances high profit/low holding).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1079.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), women's skinny jeans (everyday collection). No major calendar events nearby (post-Valentine, pre-spring). Historical demands (pre-P1): avg ~62, std ~9. Actual demands: P1(2/11):93, P2(2/18):81, P3(2/25):59 (avg 77.7, std ~17); possible pre-Valentine spike in P1-P2 (+30-50% vs hist), dropping back in P3 toward hist levels. On-hand=42, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. LT consistently 0 (P1-P3 concludes: each order arrived same period). Use default L=0 (promised/observed). mu_hat recent_3 (N=3, regime post-changepoint P1 spike, length=3) for (1+0)*77.7 to cover recent avg while P3 drop noted. sigma_hat recent_3 (higher vol) for safety. High q=19/20=0.95 favors coverage vs holding; params boost base-stock vs default hist mean=62 to prevent stockout on ~70-80 demand.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently 0 periods (P1 order arrived P1, P2-P2, P3-P3)

Daily Reward (R_t): $713.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), women's skinny jeans in everyday collection, early March post-winter with no immediate holidays (Easter later in April). Demand trend decreasing sharply: P1:93, P2:81, P3:59 (-27%), P4:41 (-30%), changepoint after P2 with lower regime P3-P4 avg=50 (-39% vs P1-P2 avg=87). Lead time consistently 0 periods confirmed through P4 arrivals (no overdue or lost shipments). On-hand=66 (from P4 ending), in-transit=0, covers multiple recent demands. Use recent_N=3 (P2-P4 demands:81,59,41; regime length=3 including transition, mean~60, std~20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to lower mean/higher volatility vs default (older samples mean~62, low std~8). L=default (promised 0, matches all observed). Lowers base_stock~(60 + 1.645*20)~93 vs inventory 66, orders ~27 to buffer demand while minimizing excess holding ($1 low vs $19 profit).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Early spring, women's everyday skinny jeans; no major calendar events impacting demand (post-St. Patrick's Day, irrelevant for jeans). On-hand=27 low, in-transit=0; all prior orders (P1-P5) arrived same-period (LT=0 confirmed consistently). Game demands P1-P5: 93,81,59,41,67 (mean=68.2, sample std=20.0), vs samples mean=61.6/std=9.0. Recent game data shows moderately higher mean (+10%) and significantly higher volatility; no clear single changepoint but sustained over 5 periods. L=default (promised 0, matches all observed). mu_hat=explicit 68.2 (1+0 \xd7 recent game mean), sigma_hat=explicit 20.0 (recent game std). Targets base_stock\u224868.2+1.645\xd720\u2248101; order\u2248101-27=74 to cover demand+safety, avoiding stockouts (high profit) while limiting excess (low holding); cap similar.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed over P1-P5: mean 68.2 (+10% vs samples 61.6), volatility std=20 (+122% vs samples 9); sustained higher/volatile demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), late March, no major holidays or seasonal spikes for women's skinny jeans (everyday collection); steady spring transition expected. Lead time confirmed 0 periods consistently (P1-P6 all arrived same period, no in-transit or losses). Demands P1-P6: 93,81,59,41,67,48 (mean 64.8 > samples 61.6 +5%, std ~20 sustained volatile regime per carry-over P1-P5, P6 fits volatility). On-hand 54 sufficient for low demand like P6=48 but risky for avg ~65; no overdue shipments. Use recent_6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained higher/volatile regime (N=6=max(min(6,20),3)); L default=0. Parameters target base_stock ~64.8 + z*20 (z~1.645 for q=19/20=0.95), order to cover 1-period demand post high service to max profit vs low holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $942.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8, date 2019/4/1 (early April, spring start; women's everyday skinny jeans - no major holidays imminent, Easter 4/21 may influence later but not yet; demand potentially stable post-winter). Inventory: on-hand 46, in-transit 0; all prior orders (P1-P7) arrived same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed consistently, no losses/overdues). Demands P1-P7: [93,81,59,41,67,48,52], mean=63 (+2% vs initial samples 61.6), std\u224817.3 (+92% vs samples ~9), aligning with carry-over P1-P5 regime (mean68.2, std20) as sustained higher/volatile demand (7 periods >3, recent P5-P7 [67,48,52] mean55.7 within volatile range, no confirmed drop). L default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to feed backend actual regime mean/volatility (vs initial samples only), yielding base_stock\u224863 + 1.645*17.3\u224891; order\u224891-46=45 (capped similarly), covers expected demand+safety, prioritizes service (profit 19>>holding 1, q=0.95).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early April approaching Easter (4/21/2019) which may boost women's clothing demand including jeans. On-hand=29 low vs recent demand=65 (P8), in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments\u2014all P1-P8 orders arrived same period (lead_time=0 confirmed). Demand P1-P8: mean=63.25 (slight +3% vs samples 61.6), std\u224817.3 (higher vol vs samples std=9, as per carry-over P1-P5 std=20). Recent P6-P8 mean=55, std\u22488.9 but only 3 periods\u2014not sustained changepoint. No calendar-driven spike yet. L=default (promised 0, matches all history). mu_hat=recent_N N=8 for stable higher mean forecast (~63). sigma_hat=recent_N N=8 for elevated vol (~17). Raises base_stock to ~63 + 1.645*17 \u2248101 (vs default ~62+15\u224877), order\u224872 covers demand+buffer post low stock, targets q=0.95 service while capping overstock risk.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), mid-spring, everyday women's jeans, no major holidays imminent (Easter 4/21 minor potential). On-hand 50, in-transit 0, no overdue/missing shipments\u2014all prior orders arrived same-period (L=0 confirmed P1-P9). Demands P1-P9 avg 60.9, but changepoint post-P5: P1-P5 mean 68.2/std20 (high/volatile), P6-P9 mean51.75/std9.7 (lower/stable, -24% mean, normalized vol). Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to match new regime (N=4=regime length), L default=0 (matches observed). Lowers base_stock ~52 +1.645*10\u224868 vs prior higher, balances high profit service vs holding by avoiding excess inventory on recent low demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward starting Period 6: mean 51.75 P6-P9 (-24% vs P1-P5 68.2), sustained 4 periods; volatility normalized std=9.7 P6-P9 (vs 20 P1-P5)

Period 11 (2019/4/22): Late April, no major holidays; women's skinny jeans in everyday collection, steady spring demand expected but recent data shows sustained downward regime from P6-P10 (demands:48,52,65,42,44; mean=50.2, std\u22489.4). On-hand=24, in-transit=0; all historical orders (P1-P10) arrived with LT=0, no losses/overdues. Use L=default (promised/confirmed 0). mu_hat=recent_5 to capture lower mean demand regime (chgpnt P6, length=5, N=5). sigma_hat=recent_5 for normalized volatility (std\u22489.4 vs prior 20). Lowers base stock (q=19/20=0.95 high service) to match ~50 demand, minimize holding on 24 OH while covering (1+0) periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29): Late spring, women's skinny jeans in everyday collection; no major holidays (Easter passed P11 with normal demand). Demand regime sustained low since P6 changepoint: P6-P11 demands [48,52,65,42,44,53], mean=50.67 (-25% vs P1-P5 68.2), std\u22488.8 (normalized vs prior 20). On-hand=13 low but lead time=0 confirmed all 11 periods (every order arrived same period, no losses/in-transit overdue=0).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6), early May approaching Mother's Day (May 12), potential demand uptick for women's apparel like jeans. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, stockout in P12 (demand=88 >65 sold). Lead time consistently 0 across all P1-P12 (no discrepancies). Demands P1-P12 mean~61, but carry-over downward regime P6-P9 mean51.75 std9.7; recent P10-P12:44,53,88 mean61.7 (+19%), std~19 (vol up), signaling regime shift back to higher/volatile like P1-P5. No overdue/lost shipments. Set L default=0 (confirmed). mu_hat recent_N=3 captures recent mean~62 for (1+0). sigma_hat recent_N=3 for vol~19. This boosts base_stock to ~62 + 1.645*19 \u224893 (q=19/20=0.95), reducing stockouts vs holding, with cap safety.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward starting Period 10: mean 61.7 P10-P12 (+19% vs P6-P9 51.75), volatility increased std=19 vs 9.7; sustained 3 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13), post-Mother's Day (May 12). Product: women's skinny jeans, everyday collection; steady demand but recent spikes possibly holiday-related. On-hand=26 (low vs recent demands), in-transit=0, no overdue shipments\u2014all historical orders arrived same period (lead time=0 confirmed). Demand history: P10-P13 (44,53,88,74) mean=64.75 (+25% vs P6-P9 low regime 51.75), std\u224820 (volatile); upward shift from P10 sustained 4 periods (changenpoint evidence: post-P9 low, consistent highs P12-P13). No new losses/delays. L='default' (promised=0, matches all observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat='recent_N' N=4 to capture sustained higher/volatile regime over (1+L)=1 period: \u03bc\u0302\u224864.75, \u03c3\u0302\u224820. High base stock (q=19/20=0.95) prioritizes service vs holding, covers recent demand to avoid stockouts (e.g., P12/P13 highs), replenishes low on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Upward demand regime starting P10 extended to P13: mean 64.75 P10-P13 (+25% vs P6-P9 51.75), volatility std\u224820 (vs 9.7); sustained 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20, mid-spring, no major holidays; women's skinny jeans steady seasonal demand). On-hand=42, in-transit=0; all historical orders arrived same-period (LT=0 confirmed P1-P14, no losses). Recent demand regime P10-P14 (44,53,88,74,56): mean=63 (+23% vs P6-P9 51.75), std\u224815.8 (elevated vol sustained); extends prior upward shift. Use L=default (promised 0, matches all observed). mu_hat=recent_5 (backend:1*mean P10-P14\u224863, targets recent higher mean). sigma_hat=recent_5 (backend:sqrt(1)*std\u224815.8, captures vol for safety stock). Balances high service (q\u224819/20=0.95) vs holding with recent regime, ensures base stock ~63 + 1.645*15.8 \u224890 covers expected demand post-decision.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, Memorial Day holiday - potential retail demand increase for summer apparel like jeans). Lead time consistently 0 periods (all P1-P15 orders arrived same period, no in-transit or losses). Recent demand regime P10-P15 (44,53,88,74,56,57): mean=62 (+20% vs P6-P9 low 51.75), std\u224816 (volatile due to P12=88 spike and highs); sustained 6 periods confirming upward shift. On-hand=36 covers ~58% of expected ~62 demand, risking stockout given vol. No new changepoints. Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target recent regime (mu_hat=62, sigma_hat\u224816), L=default=0. This raises base_stock to ~62 + z*16 (z\u22482.33 for q=19/20), balancing high service vs holding; OR cap irrelevant as orders fit.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=55 covers expected ~55-65 demand; in-transit=0, no losses/overdues (all historical orders arrived same-period exactly). Lead time consistently 0 (16/16 periods). Use default L=0 (promised/observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=7 (P10-P16 regime length=7, post-P9 downward shift; evidence: mean 58 vs prior 52, std~22 vs 9.7).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10), early summer; skinny jeans demand plausibly declining due to seasonal warm weather shift. Recent demands P14-P17: 56,57,34,21 (mean=42, std\u224815.2), confirming sustained downward regime vs prior P10-P13 mean 64.75 (+25% over P6-P9), now -35%. On-hand=67 high relative to recent ~20-50 demand, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. L=0 consistently observed all 17 periods. Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low-demand regime (N=4 matches regime length=4>=3), scaling to (1+0)=1 period. Lowers mu_hat\u224842, sigma_hat\u224815 to reduce base_stock, minimize holding costs on excess inventory while covering low demand; default L=0 trusted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward starting Period 14: mean 42 P14-P17 (-35% vs P10-P13 64.75), volatility std\u224815 vs 20; sustained 4 periods.

Lead time confirmed 0 across all 18 periods (latest P18 order arrived P18). On-hand=33, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Use default L=0 (promised/actual). recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained low-demand regime (length=5), informing OR backend to target base_stock ~41 + 1.645*15 ~67, ordering ~34 to cover expected demand while minimizing holding (recent avg 41 < current OH 33 risks minor stockout, but low regime justifies conservative).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21, date 2019/7/1 (early summer Monday). Jeans demand remains low in summer regime starting P14 (mid-May 2019/5/13), consistent with seasonal drop for denim trousers as warmer weather reduces sales; P14-P20 demands:56,57,34,21,38,50,47 (mean=43.3, std\u224814.7, -33% vs P10-P13 64.75). No changepoint evidence for new shift; sustained 7 periods. Lead time confirmed 0 across all 20 periods (latest P20 order arrived P20). No in-transit, on-hand=19 (from P20 ending) covers ~0.4 recent periods; expect demand ~43. L=default (promised/confirmed 0). mu_hat=recent_7 (regime length=7>=3, cap20), sigma_hat=recent_7 for backend to compute (1+0)*43.3 mean / sqrt(1)*14.7 std, targets base_stock ~43 + 1.645*15=70ish (q=19/20=0.95), balancing low holding vs service amid volatility.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime extended P14-P20: mean 43.3 (-33% vs P10-P13 64.75), std=14.7 (down from 20), sustained 7 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8), early July post-Independence Day week (P21:7/1 demand=79 spike, likely holiday effect on jeans). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline, high stockout risk after P21 stockout. Lead time consistently 0 across all 21 periods, no losses/d drifts. Demand history: prior downward regime P14-P20 mean~43.3 std~14.7 sustained; broken by P19-P21 (50,47,79) mean=58.7 (+42% vs P14-P18 mean=41.2), std~14.4, sustained 3 periods indicating new upward regime/changepoint at P19. No immediate calendar spikes beyond post-holiday normalization expected. Set L='default' (promised=0 confirmed). mu_hat='recent_N' N=3 (regime length=3) for (1+0)*58.7~59 covering recent uptrend. sigma_hat='recent_N' N=3 capturing volatility~14. Helps OR backend target high service (q=19/20=0.95, z~1.65) base-stock~59+1.65*14~82 to prevent lost sales (high profit), low holding exposure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward starting Period 19: mean 58.7 P19-P21 (+42% vs P14-P18 41.2), volatility std~14.4 (similar to prior); sustained 3 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15, mid-summer): Women's skinny jeans demand shows sustained upward regime P19-P22 (50,47,79,110; mean 71.5 +65% vs prior P14-P20 43.3), high volatility std=29.4 (up from prior regimes ~15); recent stockouts P21-P22 (demand 79/110 > supply, ending=0) confirm need for higher forecast. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical orders arrived same-period, L=0 confirmed 22x). No major calendar events imminent (post-July 4, pre-back-to-school). Use L default (promised/actual=0). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 to capture regime mean/volatility post-changepoint ~P19 (N=4=max(min(regime_length=4,20),3)). Backend base_stock ~71.5 + 1.645*29.4 ~119 (q=19/20=0.95), covers spikes while limiting excess holding (low $1/unit cost).

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Upward demand regime extended P19-P22: mean 71.5 (+65% vs P14-P20 43.3), volatility std=29.4 (+100% vs prior downward 14.7); sustained 4 periods with stockouts confirming shift.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22, mid-summer). Women's skinny jeans demand in upward regime since P19 (carry-over confirmed), extended P19-P23: demands 50,47,79,110,141 (mean 85.4 +20% vs prior P19-P22 71.5), high vol std~36 (+22% vs 29.4), evidenced by 3 consecutive stockouts P21-P23 despite increasing orders. No pipeline/on-hand=0 risks stockout. L consistently 0 (all history). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target (1+0)*85.4 base with high safety stock for vol, balancing profit vs holding while covering surge. Default L uses confirmed 0. No overdue/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime extended P19-P23: mean 85.4 (+20% vs P19-P22 71.5), std~36 (+22% vs 29.4); sustained 5 periods with 3 consecutive stockouts confirming intensification.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29, late July summer). Women's skinny jeans (everyday trousers). Recent demand P19-P24: 50,47,79,110,141,77 (mean=84, std~36), volatile upward regime sustained 6 periods (P19 start per carry-over, stockouts P21-P23, P24=77 dip but mean elevated +94% vs prior downward P14-P20 ~43). On-hand=75 (from P24 end), in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time consistently 0 per all history & carry-over). No new regime shift (P24 single dip insufficient for 3+ sustained evidence). L=default (confirmed 0). mu_hat=recent_N N=6 ((1+0)*84), sigma_hat=recent_N N=6 (sqrt(1+0)*36) to capture high/volatile regime, ensuring base stock covers ~84+ z*36 (z~0.95 for q=19/20) ~140-160, preventing stockouts while limiting excess hold (75 on-hand covers ~1pd).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5, early August, summer; women's skinny jeans - seasonal demand potentially tapering post-July peak but recent data shows sustained high). Confirmed L=0 consistent across all 25 periods (no in-transit, all orders arrived same period). Recent upward demand regime P19-P25 sustained 7 periods: demands [50,47,79,110,141,77,85], mean=84.1 (+97% vs prior downward P14-P18 ~42), std\u224833 (+124% vs prior ~15); includes 3 stockouts P21-P23 confirming shift intensity, P24-P25 high at 77/85 despite no stockouts due to larger orders. On-hand=59 covers <1 period expected demand, no pipeline/overdues. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target (1+0)*84.1 mean and sqrt(1+0)*33 std, yielding high base_stock (~84 + 1.645*33\u2248138) for q=0.95 service (prioritizes profit vs $1 holding), avoiding stockouts while backend cap limits excess.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12): Mid-August, back-to-school season likely fueling sustained high demand for women's skinny jeans (everyday trousers). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline or overdue shipments (lead time consistently 0 per all 26 concludes). Recent demands P19-P26 (8 periods): 50,47,79,110,141,77,85,177; mean=95.75 (high vs prior regimes), std\u224836.8 (volatile, multiple stockouts P21-P23,P26). Upward regime since P19 confirmed sustained. L=default (actual=0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=8 to capture regime mean/volatility for higher base stock (q=19/20=0.95, z\u22481.645), prioritizing sales vs holding; cap prevents excess. Addresses stockouts by inflating parameters beyond historical samples (mean~62).

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime extended and intensified P19-P26: mean 95.75 (+11% vs P19-P23 85.4), recent P24-P26 mean=113 (+32%), std\u224836.8 (high volatility); sustained 8 periods with stockouts P21-23,P26 and back-to-school peak 177 confirming shift.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019/8/19), late August back-to-school peak for women's jeans; sustained upward demand regime from P19-P27 (9 periods, mean ~119.7 vs prior downward ~43, +178%), intensified recently (P24-P27 mean ~162.5, P26=177, P27=311 with stockout); high volatility std ~50+ recently. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (lead time consistently 0). Use recent_N=9 capturing full upward regime since P19 changepoint (per carry-over) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to forecast elevated mean/volatility over 1+L=1 period, balancing high service (q=0.95) vs holding; L=default (promised/observed 0). Ensures base stock covers ~120 + safety for vol, preventing further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further intensified starting P24: P24-P27 mean 162.5 (+70% vs P19-P23 71.5), std~90 (high vol with spikes 177/311); sustained 4 periods with consecutive high demand/stockouts.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26), late August back-to-school season peak for women's jeans; sustained high demand regime intensified P24-P28 (demands 77,85,177,311,262; mean 182.4, std\u2248105), +12% mean vs P24-P27 (162.5), confirming carry-over shift with spikes/stockouts (P26-P28 avg~250). Lead time consistently 0 (all historical confirms, no in-transit/overdues). On-hand=0, pipeline=0 risks stockout. Set L default (0), mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 to capture regime (backend: mu=182.4, sigma=105); base_stock\u2248182+1.645*105\u2248355 covers spikes (max recent 311) at q=0.95 service, balancing profit vs low holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further intensified and extended P24-P28: mean 182.4 (+12% vs P24-P27 162.5), std\u2248105 (+17% vs ~90); sustained 5 periods with demand=262 and back-to-school peak (P26-P28 avg~250) confirming continuation.

Use recent_6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent high/volatile regime (changelength=6); L=default (confirmed LT=0). Yields base_stock\u2248187.5+1.645*94\u2248342; order\u2248342-141=201 covering expected ~188 demand + safety vs holding cost (q=0.95 high service prioritizes avoiding stockouts).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9): Early September, back-to-school season ongoing post-Labor Day (P30 9/2 demand=223 high). Recent demand regime shift at P26 (back-to-school spike 177, sustained 5 periods P26-P30 mean=237 +30% vs prior P14-P25 ~45-65, with spikes to 311 confirming high mean/vol vs early-year samples ~62). On-hand=120, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time consistently 0). Use recent_N=5 (regime length=5) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture intensified regime (backend: mu_hat=237, sigma_hat~51), L=default=0. Yields base_stock~237 + 1.645*51~321 (q=19/20=0.95), order=min(321-120, cap)~201 to cover ~237 demand + ~84 safety, minimizing stockouts (high profit) while low holding; ignores pre-P26 lows.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand regime extended and intensified P26-P30: mean 237 (+30% vs P24-P25 avg 81), std~51 (high vol with 311 spike); sustained 5 periods through early Sep back-to-school post-Labor Day.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16), mid-September post-Labor Day (Sep 2=P30). Back-to-school demand for women's jeans peaked P26-P30 (mean 237, spikes to 311/262), P31=137 (-38% drop) signals possible taper but single period lacks sustained evidence for regime shift (needs 3+ periods). On-hand=185 covers recent demand (137-223) with buffer vs spikes; no in-transit, lead time consistently 0 (all orders arrive same period). No overdue/missing shipments. Use recent_N=6 (P26-P31 regime length=6, max(min(6,20),3)=6) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture intensified high mean ~220/std ~62 despite P31 dip, ensuring base_stock buffers volatility/spikes for q=19/20=0.95 service while minimizing holding (L=0 so 1-period horizon). Default L=0 aligns with confirmed actual.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Late September post-back-to-school (peaked P26-P30 avg~237 with spikes to 311) and Labor Day (P30:223); demand changepoint downward from P31:137 (-38% vs P30), P32:92 (-33% vs P31), signaling post-peak decline for women's skinny jeans (everyday trousers, less seasonal urgency now). On-hand=230 high vs recent demands, in-transit=0, all prior orders arrived LT=0 (incl. P32). No overdue shipments. Regime length=2 periods (P31-P32), so N=max(min(2,20),3)=3 for recent_N on mu_hat/sigma_hat using P30-P32 (mean~151, std~67); L=default (confirmed 0). Lowers mu_hat~151, sigma_hat~67 vs prior highs, base_stock~151+1.645*67\u2248261, order~31 (min(261-230,cap)), balances high service (q=19/20) vs holding cost with ample inventory, avoids overorder amid drop.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): End of September, post-Labor Day (P30 ~9/2) and back-to-school peak (P26-30 highs like 311,262, avg 237). Recent demands P31-33:137,92,121 (avg 116.7, -51% vs P26-30; std~23 vs prior ~51), signaling sustained downward shift aligned with calendar (back-to-school tail-off toward fall). On-hand=140 (from P33 ending), in-transit=0, no overdue (lead time consistently 0). No stockouts recent. Use L=default (confirmed 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N=3 for new downward regime (N=3=max(min(3,20),3)), yielding ~mu=117, sigma=23; base_stock~117+1.645*23~155. Orders ~15 to top up, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding amid decline, preventing overstock as winter approaches.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward post-back-to-school starting Period 31: mean 116.7 P31-P33 (-51% vs P26-P30 237), std~23 (down from ~51); sustained 3 periods with post-Labor Day calendar.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7), post-back-to-school and post-Labor Day (9/2), fall season start for women's skinny jeans; no major holidays imminent (Columbus Day 10/14 minor impact). Downward demand regime from P31 confirmed sustained 4 periods: P31-34 demands 137/92/121/75 (mean 106.25, -9% vs P31-P33 116.7, -51% vs peak P26-P30 237; std~24.2, lower vol vs peak ~105). All historical LT=0 confirmed (P34 order arrived same period), no in-transit/overdues. On-hand 80 covers expected ~100 but risks stockout on high end of vol. L default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=4 captures current regime (backend: mu=106.25, sigma=24.2), base_stock~106+1.645*24~145 (q=19/20=0.95), orders~65 to balance service vs holding amid dropping demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Downward post-back-to-school demand regime extended P31-P34: mean 106.25 (-51% vs P26-P30 237), std~24 (down from ~105); sustained 4 periods.

P35 demand=237 (major stockout, sold=153/237) breaks prior downward regime (P31-P34 mean~106), signaling rebound or seasonal ramp-up. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (all LT=0 confirmed). L=default (promised/actual=0). mu_hat=recent_N N=5 (P31-P35 demands 137/92/121/75/237, mean~132) and sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 (std~63); (1+L)=1 so base_stock~132 + 1.645*63~236, targets recent peak 237 for high service level (q=19/20=0.95), minimizes lost sales vs low holding.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21): Late October, post-back-to-school (Aug-Sep peaks P26-30 ~250 avg, Sep drop P31-34 ~106 mean per carry-over), but renewed spike P35:237, P36:282 (both stockouts, lost ~45+ sales), suggesting possible fall demand uptick (cooler weather/early holiday for everyday jeans) though only 2 periods not yet sustained. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (L consistently 0 per all 36 concludes). No pipeline to rely on. Use recent_N=6 (P31-36 demands:137,92,121,75,237,282; mean~157, std~78) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to balance Sep drop + Oct highs/volatility; with L=0, mu_hat=157, sigma_hat=78 \u2192 base_stock~157+1.645*78\u2248285 (high service q=19/20=0.95 covers recent 282 demand tail, minimizes lost profit vs holding).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28, late October pre-Halloween). Product: women's skinny jeans (everyday). On-hand=142, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time consistently 0 as per all concludes and carry-over). Recent demand changepoint at P35: upward shift from post-back-to-school low P31-P34 mean~106 (std~24) to P35-P37 mean=224 (+110%), std=65 (up sharply); sustained 3 periods with stockouts P35-P36 (237,282 demands). Volatility high amid fall/winter transition. Use L=default (confirmed 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 (regime_length=3, max(min(3,20),3)=3) to capture elevated mean/vol for (1+0)=1 period, yielding base_stock~224+1.645*65~331 (order~189 to cover from 142 OH, balancing high service q=0.95 vs holding; anticipates continued Oct uptick).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward starting Period 35: mean 224 P35-P37 (+110% vs P31-P34 ~106), std~65 (up from ~24); sustained 3 periods with stockouts P35-P36 confirming shift.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/04), early November approaching Thanksgiving (Nov 28 ~P42) and holiday season; women's skinny jeans may see demand uptick for everyday wear. LT consistently 0 periods (all orders arrive same period, no losses/missing). On-hand 204, in-transit 0, no pipeline issues. Recent demands P35-P38: 237/282/153/128 (mean 200 +88% vs P31-P34 ~106 low post-back-to-school regime, std~72 up from ~24), upward volatile regime sustained 4 periods (stockouts P35-P36). P37-P38 dip to 153/128 but still above prior regime. Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current high-demand/volatility (backend: mu_hat=200, sigma_hat~72), L=default=0; targets base_stock~200+1.645*72~318 (order~114), high service (q=0.95) avoids stockouts while limiting hold cost on 204 OH. All history reconfirms LT=0.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Upward demand regime extended P35-P38: mean 200 (+88% vs P31-P34 ~106), std~72 (up from ~24); sustained 4 periods with early stockouts confirming persistence into early Nov pre-holiday.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11, Veterans Day Monday, ~2 weeks pre-Thanksgiving 11/28 ~P42/Black Friday P43) for women's skinny high-waist stretch jeans (everyday casual wear, potential holiday shopping ramp-up). Recent demands: P37:153, P38:128, P39:119 (mean 133, std~18, -33% vs P35-P38 mean 200); earlier P35:237/P36:282 spikes with stockouts. Full recent_5 (P35-P39) mean 184, std~72 better captures volatile regime amid pre-holiday calendar (Thanksgiving/Black Friday spikes possible for jeans). On-hand 200, in-transit 0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical lead times=0 confirmed in concludes). L default=0 (promised/actual consistent). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 targets (1+0)*184 mean demand, base_stock ~184 + 1.645*72 ~302 (q=19/20=0.95), orders ~102 to buffer spikes/stockouts (frequent in high regimes), minimizes lost sales vs low holding $1/unit.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime shift downward starting Period 37: mean 133 P37-P39 (-33% vs P35-P38 200), std~18 (down from 72); sustained 3 periods pre-Thanksgiving.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18), pre-Thanksgiving (11/28 during P42). Recent demand P37-P40: 153,128,119,60 (mean=115, std\u224839.4), extending downward regime from P37 (evidence: -33% drop P37-P39 vs prior upward P35-P38 mean200; P40=60 further -55% confirms sustained decline post-Oct spikes, aligned with pre-holiday lull for everyday jeans). High on-hand=243, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time consistently 0 per all 40 periods). L default uses confirmed 0. mu_hat recent_4 (N=4=max(min(regime_length=4,20),3)) forecasts low mean=115\xd7(1+0). sigma_hat recent_4 captures vol uptick. Base stock \u2248115+1.645\xd739.4\u2248179 <243 pipeline \u2192 order\u22480, cuts holding costs ($1/unit) while 95% service (q=19/20) covers regime demand; conservative vs potential holiday uptick given data trend.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Downward pre-Thanksgiving demand regime extended P37-P40: mean 115 (-13% vs P37-P39 133), std\u224839 (+117% vs 18); sustained 4 periods with P40=60 confirming further decline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Thanksgiving/Black Friday week (Nov 28-29). Women's skinny jeans in everyday collection expect massive holiday shopping demand spike, similar to back-to-school peaks (P26-P28,P35-P36: avg ~250, spikes to 311; std ~80-100). Recent downward pre-Thanksgiving regime P37-P41: demands 153/128/119/60/36 (mean ~99, std~39), but calendar event overrides with imminent shift (low P40-P41 confirms lull end). Lead time consistently 0 (all orders arrived same period, no losses). On-hand=207, in-transit=0 sufficient for low demand but risks stockout on spike. L=default (promised 0 confirmed). mu_hat=explicit 250 ((1+0)*holiday forecast). sigma_hat=explicit 80 (volatility from past peaks). Ensures high base stock ~250 + 1.645*80 \u2248381 (q=19/20=0.95), order ~381-207=174 to cover spike, balancing high service vs holding.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2): Cyber Monday, major holiday shopping event expected to drive demand spike for women's jeans similar to back-to-school peaks (P26-P28 avg ~250, up to 311). Recent pre-Thanksgiving lull P40-P42 demand 60/36/47 (mean 47.7, std~12) confirms downward regime, but calendar overrides for one-off high-demand day. On-hand 335 covers base case, in-transit 0, no overdue/missing shipments (P42 order arrived same period, lead=0 consistent). Set L default (promised 0 confirmed all history). Explicit mu_hat=250 (holiday peak forecast), sigma_hat=90 (vol from prior spikes P24-P30 std~90) to target base_stock ~250+1.645*90~398 (z* for q=19/20=0.95), yielding order ~63 to buffer 335->~398 total vs cap, balancing stockout risk vs low holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Thanksgiving low demand regime intensified P40-P42: mean 47.7 (-58% vs P37-P39 133), std~12.1 (low vol vs prior 39); sustained 3 periods confirming further decline into late Nov.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9): Early Christmas holiday season post-Cyber Monday (Dec 2, P43 demand=235, +393% vs P40-P42 low regime mean 47.7, std~12). Women's high-waist skinny jeans (everyday trousers) expect sustained high demand ramp-up to Christmas (P44-P47), analogous to back-to-school peaks (P26-P30 mean 237, std~45; P35-P36 mean 260). On-hand=164, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (all LT=0 confirmed thru P43). Recent changepoint P43: abrupt upward shift + holiday calendar evidence. L=default (promised/actual consistent 0). mu_hat=explicit value=240 ((1+0)*forecast: avg prior peaks 237/260/235). sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 (P41-P43 demands 36/47/235, std~91 capturing vol shift; N=max(min(regime_len=1,20),3)=3). Yields base_stock~240+1.645*91\u2248390, order~226 to target pipeline~390 pre-demand (164+226=390 covers 240 mean +150 safety), preventing stockouts while q=0.95 balances profit/holding.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), mid-December pre-Christmas holiday peak for women's skinny high-waist jeans; expect sustained high demand escalation (Christmas shopping week). Recent: P44 demand=370 (Dec9), P43=235 (Dec2), sharp upward shift post-Thanksgiving lows (P40-P42 avg~47.7, +534%). No in-transit, on-hand=54 low vs expected ~350+; all historical lead times confirmed 0 (no losses/overdues). Use default L=0. Explicit mu_hat=350 (1+L x forecast blending P43-P44 avg302 + holiday peak anticipation similar to prior spikes 311/282/370), sigma_hat=90 (high vol matching P43-P44 ~95 and prior peaks ~60-90) to yield high base_stock ~350 + 1.645*90 \u2248 398 (q=19/20=0.95 service), order \u2248398-54=344 (well under cap~350+1.645*90\u2248448), preventing stockout while minimizing excess hold (profit>>holding).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23): Pre-Christmas peak (Dec 23-29 incl. Christmas Day), expect sustained high demand for women's jeans due to holiday shopping surge. Recent demands P43=235, P44=370, P45=293 (mean=299, std~68) confirm new upward regime shift from Nov lows (P40-P42 mean~47, +528%), changepoint at P43 with sustained 3 periods of holiday peaks/stockout risks (P44 end=54). On-hand=206 sufficient buffer but needs replenishment for ~300 expect; no in-transit, lead time consistently 0 (all arrives same period). Use L default (promised 0). mu_hat recent_3 and sigma_hat recent_3 capture regime (backend: mu_hat=299, sigma_hat=68; base_stock~299+1.645*68~411; order~411-206=205 to target high service level q=0.95 during peak, balancing profit vs holding; cap sufficient).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward for Christmas holiday starting Period 43: mean 299 P43-P45 (+528% vs P40-P42 47.7), std~68 (up from ~12); sustained 3 periods with peaks 370/293 confirming seasonal surge.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas/New Year's eve week for women's skinny jeans; expect potential tail-end holiday demand or sharp drop-off after P46=162 (down 45% from P45=293). Holiday surge regime confirmed P43-P46 (12/2-12/23): demands 235/370/293/162, mean=265 (+457% vs P40-P42 mean~48), std~88 (high vol), sustained 4 periods with peaks aligning to Christmas calendar. No in-transit, all prior orders arrived same-period (L=0 consistent), OH=249 from P46 ending covers likely demand. No overdue shipments. Changepoint at P43 upward sustained to P46 (regime length=4, N=4). Use L default (promised=0); mu_hat recent_4 (1+0)*265 mean captures elevated regime; sigma_hat recent_4 sqrt(1+0)*88 for vol. Targets base_stock~265+1.645*88~410, order~161 (410-249), high service (q=19/20=0.95) for profit while limiting excess hold on declining post-holiday.
