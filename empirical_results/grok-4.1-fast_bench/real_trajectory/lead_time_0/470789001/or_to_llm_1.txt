No in-transit or lost shipments. Current inventory position: on-hand=38, in-transit=0. Demand analysis: Sustained low phase post-Labor Day (P31-P40 avg=38, -58% vs P1-P14 avg=91), persisting into late November despite holiday approach; P41 demand=48 (slight +26% vs prior avg but single period, not yet sustained 3+). Current date 2019/11/25 (Monday before Thanksgiving 11/28/Black Friday 11/29) for women's microfibre Brazilian briefs (lingerie/underwear) - potential Black Friday/gift demand uptick possible, but carry-over insights confirm no holiday rebound after 10+ low periods. Historical early avg ~91, but recent reality overrides. OR recommendation=47 aligns with recent low mean (~38-48) under promised L=0; base-stock logic: order to cover 1-period demand + safety. No pipeline, on-hand=38 covers partial demand, so 47 replenishes to ~85 (expected demand ~45-50, ending inv ~35-40, balanced since profit=holding=1). No override needed - conservative follow OR avoids overstock risk in proven low phase. Carry-over: No new sustained shift (P41 uptick=48 isolated, needs 3+ periods confirmation).",
