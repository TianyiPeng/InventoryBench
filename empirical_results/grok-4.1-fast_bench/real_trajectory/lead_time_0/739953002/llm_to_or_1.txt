Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1, date 2019-02-11 (mid-February, post-Valentine's awareness but historical Feb-04 demand at 29). Women's everyday V-neck blouse; no strong seasonal spike expected yet but Valentine's may influence. Demand history: early Jan 0s, then shift to positive (14,47,29 last 3 weeks, mean=30 vs overall 18). Changepoint at 2019-01-21 (regime length=3 weeks). No lead time observations (first period, no concludes). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; need initial stock. Set L=default (promised 0). mu_hat=recent_3 (covers recent regime (1+0)*30=30). sigma_hat=recent_3 (matches recent volatility). Helps OR backend target base_stock ~30 + 0.84*16.5~43, balancing service (q=0.8) vs holding, avoiding stockout at start.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-01-21: avg from 0 (first 2 weeks) to 30 (+\u221e%) sustained over last 3 weeks (14,47,29)

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18): Mid-February, women's everyday V-neck blouse; demand regime high since 2019-01-21 changepoint (14,47,29,16; avg=26.5, sustained 4 periods vs prior 0s). LT=0 confirmed (Period 1 order arrived same period). On-hand=28 covers ~1-2 periods demand; no in-transit/overdues. Use default L=0 (matches observed). mu_hat recent_4 captures elevated regime mean*1=~26.5. sigma_hat recent_4 for high recent volatility (~13). Ensures base stock ~26.5 + 0.84*13 ~38 targets q=4/5 service, low holding risk with L=0; OR cap prevents overorder.

Carry-over insight: Demand high regime extended: 4 periods (2019-01-21 to 02-11) avg 26.5 (14,47,29,16), down slightly from prior 30 but sustained >14

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25): Late February, everyday women's blouse; post-Valentine period with no major holidays imminent. Demand high regime sustained (shift at 2019-01-21 confirmed over 5 weeks: demands 14,47,29,16,23; avg=25.8, all >14 vs early 0s). Inventory: on-hand=17, in-transit=0; both prior orders (P1=44, P2=12) arrived same-period (L=0 confirmed twice, no losses). Use L=default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat=recent_N N=5 captures high regime mean~(1+0)*25.8 for base stock ~26+ z*sigma. sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 for recent volatility~12 (vs all-data inflated by early zeros). Ensures backend orders ~20-30 to cover expected demand=~25 (OH=17 risks stockout), balancing profit=4 vs holding=1; low L minimizes overstock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1; P2 order arrived P2); Demand high regime extended to 5 periods (2019-01-21 to 02-18) avg 25.8 (14,47,29,16,23), sustained >14

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04), early March, no major holidays for women's everyday blouses; steady demand expected post-Feb. Lead time confirmed 0 periods across P1-P3 arrivals. Demand high regime sustained (from 2019-01-21, recent 5: 47,29,16,23,12 avg=25.4), no new changepoint as P3 dip to 12 is single-period not sustained. On-hand=25, in-transit=0, pipeline=25 covers expected ~25 demand. Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to focus on high regime (excludes early 0s, std~13.7); L default=0. Backend base_stock\u224825.4 + 0.84*13.7\u224837, order\u224812 to target ~37 total while minimizing holding; cap ample. Balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), early March, women's everyday V-neck blouse. No major calendar events. Demand high regime since 2019-01-21 confirmed and extended (7 periods: 14,47,29,16,23,12,42; avg 26.14). LT consistently 0 over 4 periods (P1-P4 orders all arrived same period), no losses/missing shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 after P4 stockout (demand=42 > avail=37, lost ~5 sales). Use default L (promised 0). recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/vol (std~13.9); backend base_stock \u224826 + 0.84*14\u224839 (q=4/5=0.8), covers recent peaks (42,47) post-stockout while limiting hold cost ($1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Spring season for women's everyday blouses; recent demands spiked to 42 (P4) and 45 (P5) after dip at 12 (P3), extending high demand regime (avg ~26 prior, recent 5 periods: 16,23,12,42,45 avg 27.6). On-hand 0, in-transit 0, no overdue/missing shipments. Lead time confirmed 0 across all 5 periods. No changepoint yet (March spike only 2 periods, not sustained 3+). Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime ~5 periods per carry-over) to forecast mu~28, sigma~15 for (1+0) period, yielding base_stock ~28 + 0.84*15 \u224841 to cover recent highs, reduce stockouts (lost P4:5u, P5:7u), balance q=0.8 service vs holding; L default as confirmed 0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), late March spring season for women's everyday V-neck blouse. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, consistent stockouts last 3 periods due to high demand. Lead time confirmed 0 periods across all 6 periods (every order arrived same period). Demand history shows changepoint at Period 4: prior high regime avg~25.8 (up to P3 demand=12), now sustained high at avg 43.7 (P4=42,P5=45,P6=44, +69%). Recent vol low (std~1.25). No overdue shipments. Use default L=0 (promised/confirmed). mu_hat recent_3 captures elevated mean demand* (1+0)=43.7 for base_stock. sigma_hat recent_3 uses low recent std*(1+0)^{0.5}~1.25 for tight service level q=0.8. Ensures order ~45-50 units to cover demand, minimize lost sales/profit while low holding risk given L=0 and quick turnover.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg increased from 25.8 to 43.7 (+69%) sustained over last 3 periods (42,45,44)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1, early April spring). Women's everyday V-neck blouse demand in high regime since Period 4 (2019/3/4), sustained 4 periods: demands 42,45,44,56 (avg 46.75, up from prior 25.8 pre-P4). Period 7 demand=56 highest yet amid March ramp-up, no clear drop into April; anticipate continuation for spring fashion. Lead time confirmed 0 periods across all 7 periods (every order arrived same period, no in-transit or losses). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures changepoint regime (N=4=max(min(4,20),3)), yielding mu_hat=1*46.75 (L=0), higher sigma for volatility (56 spike). Default L=0. This boosts base_stock for q=0.8 service (profit$4 vs hold$1), covers ~47+ demand to avoid stockouts (recent pattern), minimizes excess hold since L=0 and cap limits overorder.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4 extended: avg 46.75 (+81% from pre-P4 25.8) sustained over 4 periods (42,45,44,56)

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring; women's V-neck blouse in everyday collection \u2013 potential seasonal demand uptick. Demand regime shift at P4 confirmed and extended (P4-P8: 42,45,44,56,81; 5 periods, avg 53.6, up 108% from pre-P4 avg ~17 across P1-P3). Recent demand increasing with high P8=81 amid stockouts (P4-P8 all ended at 0). Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 8 observed (P1-P8 orders arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments. Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high-demand regime (N=5=max(min(regime_length=5,20),3)); L=default (promised=0 confirmed). Parameters target mu_hat~(1+0)*53.6=53.6, sigma_hat~sqrt(1)*std(last5)~14.5; base_stock~53.6 + 0.84*14.5~66 (q=4/5=0.8), covering expected demand while minimizing holding (high profit favors service).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), mid-spring approaching Easter (4/21), women's V-neck blouse in everyday collection; demand may remain elevated due to seasonal spring/Easter clothing needs. Lead time confirmed 0 across all 9 periods (P1-P9 orders arrived same period). Demand regime shift at P4 (3/4) sustained high: P4-P9 (42,45,44,56,81,41) avg 51.5 (+~100% from pre-P4 avg~17), volatile (peak 81 pre-Easter, drop to 41 post-4/1). On-hand 27, in-transit 0; covers low demand but risks stockout vs recent avg 51.5. Set L default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_6 (regime length=6 since P4 changepoint, min(6,20)=6>=3) to capture elevated mean/volatility, informing OR base_stock ~51.5 + 0.84*std(~17) = ~66, order~66-27=39 balancing high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding cost while hedging Easter demand.

Demand high regime since P4 shift (confirmed in carry-over), sustained over 7 periods (P4-P10: demands 42,45,44,56,81,41,40; avg ~49.9). Recent P9-P10 stabilized ~40.5 but within regime variance (P8 81 outlier, possibly pre-Easter spike). No overdue/missing shipments; all historical lead times confirmed 0. On-hand=25 low vs expected ~45-50 demand, in-transit=0. Use L default (promised 0, consistently observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 (regime_length=7 >=3, capped<20) to capture high mean/volatility post-shift, weighting latest data; backend base_stock targets q=4/(4+1)=0.8 service level over 1 period, balancing profit vs holding while covering demand surge.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29): Women's spring blouse, late April post-Easter (4/21), possible demand softening after spring peak. Demand history: early low (pre-P4), high regime P4-P8 avg 53.6 (42,45,44,56,81 peak), now downward shift P9-P11 avg 36.3 (41,40,28, -32%). On-hand 35 covers recent ~30-40 demand; in-transit 0, no overdue (all LT=0 confirmed P1-P11). Use recent_3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture new lower mean/vol regime (std~6.8 vs prior high); L default=0. Ensures base_stock ~36 + z*6.8 (q=0.8, z~0.84) balances high service (recent stockouts P4-P8) vs holding, orders ~36 to cover (1+0) demand w/o excess.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward at Period 9: avg decreased from 53.6 (P4-P8) to 36.3 (-32%) sustained over 3 periods (41,40,28)

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6), early May with Mother's Day (May 12) upcoming, potential uplift for women's blouses but no evidence yet. Demand history shows downward regime shift at P9 sustained over 4 periods (P9-12: 41,40,28,43; avg=38, std\u22486.8), vs prior high P4-P8 avg\u224853. P12=43 rebound from P11=28 but consistent with regime avg. Lead time confirmed 0 across all 12 periods, no losses or delays. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline; must cover current period demand post-decision. Using recent_4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures sustained post-P9 regime (N=4=regime length); L=default (promised/confirmed 0). Backend base_stock\u224838 + 0.84*6.8\u224844, balancing high service (q=0.8) vs holding with recent lower mean/vol.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13), post-Mother's Day (May 12, 2019), women's everyday V-neck blouse may see steady or slight demand lift; no major calendar spike expected beyond normal spring sales. LT consistently 0 across all 13 periods (e.g., P13 order arrived P13), no losses/overdues, in-transit=0, on-hand=2 low vs recent demand ~40. Demand changepoint at P9 downward shift (per carry-over, P9-11 avg36.3), regime extended to P13 (5 periods:41,40,28,43,42 avg38.8), P11=28 likely Easter aftermath (4/22 post-4/21 Easter), rebound P12-13=43,42 confirms not sustained further drop. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=5>=3), L=default (promised/actual=0). mu_hat=1*38.8=38.8, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*std(5)~6.8 (low vol), base_stock~38.8+0.84*6.8~45 balances high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding, covers expected ~42 demand + buffer, prevents stockout given low on-hand.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments\u2014all prior orders arrived same period (L=0 confirmed consistently). Recent demands P12-14:43,42,47 (avg=44, up from P9-11 avg=36.3); temporary dip ended, new upward regime sustained 3 periods. L=default (promised/actual=0). mu_hat=recent_N N=3 captures recent mean=44 for (1+0) periods. sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 (low recent std~2.65 vs historical higher). Params boost base_stock ~46 (q=0.8, z~0.84), targets service vs holding, prevents stockouts seen in P14.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 12: avg increased from 36.3 (P9-P11) to 44 (+21%) sustained over 3 periods (43,42,47)

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all prior orders arrived same-period LT=0 confirmed across 15 periods). Recent demand regime shift upward from P12: P12-P15 demands 43,42,47,52 (avg=46, +26% vs P9-P11 avg 36.3), low vol, sustained 4 periods post-changepoint, higher than all-time avg~41; P15=52 extends uptrend amid holiday. Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target base_stock ~46 + z*4 (q=4/5=0.8, z~0.84), balancing stockouts vs holding; L default (promised/observed=0). Ensures coverage for (1+0) period demand ~46.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 12 extended: avg 46 (+26% from P9-P11 36.3) sustained over 4 periods (43,42,47,52)

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03, early summer; airy V-neck blouse suitable for season, no major holidays). Demand stable in high regime since P12 (carry-over: avg~46 over 5 periods: P12=43,P13=42,P14=47,P15=52,P16=44; mean=45.6), sustained >40 with low volatility. LT consistently 0 (all 16 prior orders arrived same period, no losses/delays). On-hand=6 low, in-transit=0; expect order to cover ~45 demand this period. Use L=default (promised=0, matches all history). mu_hat=recent_N N=5 (captures regime mean 45.6 * (1+0)). sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 (low recent std~4 vs higher historical). Parameters target base stock ~48 (mu + z*sigma, q=4/5=0.8 z~0.84), ordering ~42 to minimize stockout/holding vs profit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10), women's V-neck blouse (everyday summer wear); early June, post-Mother's Day, possible seasonal slowdown as P17 demand=27 (lowest since P11=28). Recent demands P13-P17: 42,47,52,44,27 (avg=42.4, std~9.7); prior upward regime from P12 extended through P16 avg~46, P17 drop not yet sustained. On-hand=22 (from P17 end), in-transit=0, no overdue (all historical orders arrived same-period, lead_time=0 confirmed consistently across 17 periods). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent high-vol regime incorporating P17 drop, yielding mu_hat=42.4, sigma_hat~9.7 (backend scales by sqrt(1+0)=1); L=default (0). Ensures base_stock ~42 + z*10 (z~0.84 for q=4/5=0.8) ~52, covering expected demand post-decision while minimizing holding on 22 OH; OR cap irrelevant with L=0.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=20, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments (all historical orders arrived same period, lead_time=0 confirmed consistently). Recent demand P17-P19: 27,43,30 (avg=33.3, down -27% from prior P12-P16 avg=45.6), indicating new downward regime shift sustained over 3 periods. Use L=default (promised/observed=0). mu_hat=recent_N N=3 to capture lowered mean demand over (1+0)=1 period. sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 for matching recent volatility (~8.5). Parameters target base_stock~33+0.84*8.5~41 (q=4/5=0.8), order~21 to cover expected demand post-20 on-hand, balancing high service vs holding (avoids overstocking on recent lower mean).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand 19, in-transit 0; all historical orders (P1-P20) arrived same period with LT=0 confirmed, no losses/overdues. Use default L=0 (promised/observed). mu_hat recent_N=4 to capture lowered mean of current regime (backend: 1*mean(P17-P20)~30.5). sigma_hat recent_N=4 for matching lower recent volatility (std~7.8 vs all-data higher due to P8 peak). This lowers base_stock vs default (avoids overstock on declining demand) while covering ~1 period demand post-LT, balancing profit vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward at Period 17 extended: avg 30.5 (-33% from P12-P16 45.6) sustained over 4 periods (27,43,30,22)

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08, early summer; women's everyday V-neck blouse). Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 21 prior periods, no in-transit or losses; on-hand=14 low vs recent demand avg~29 (P21=25>14, risk of stockout). Demand downward regime since P17 sustained 5 periods (27,43,30,22,25; avg=29.4, -35% from prior P12-P16 avg=45.6), volatility ~8. Use L='default' (promised 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat='recent_N' N=5 (regime_length=5) to target base stock ~29 + 0.84*8 ~36 (q=4/5=0.8), order ~36-14-0=22 covering current+buffer while minimizing holding on low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward at Period 17 extended: avg 29.4 (-35% from P12-P16 45.6) sustained over 5 periods (27,43,30,22,25)

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15, mid-summer). Women's light V-neck blouse suitable for summer weather. On-hand=4 low, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all historical orders arrived same period, lead_time=0 confirmed consistently across 22 periods). Recent demand regime downward shift at P17 sustained: P17-22 demands (27,43,30,22,25,33) avg=30 (vs prior P12-16 avg=45.6, -34%), volatility moderate. No major calendar events nearby. Use L default (promised=0, matches all observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=6 to capture current low-demand regime (regime_length=6>3), ensuring base_stock \u224830 + 0.84*std(\u22487.4)\u224836 covers expected demand post-arrival, high service (q=4/5=0.8) while minimizing holding on lower mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward at Period 17 extended: avg 30 (-34% from P12-P16 45.6) sustained over 6 periods (27,43,30,22,25,33)

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22), late summer; women's everyday V-neck blouse, no major calendar events imminent, demand historically volatile but current downward regime from P17 confirmed over 7 periods (demands:27,43,30,22,25,33,42; avg=31.7, -34% from prior P12-P16 avg45.6). All 23 prior orders arrived with lead_time=0 (no losses/overdues), on-hand=0, in-transit=0; must order to cover current period demand post-arrival. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on sustained regime (N=max(min(7,20),3)=7), L=default (promised/observed=0). Parameters target base_stock\u224831.7 + 0.84*recent_std(\u22488.4)\u224838, high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding risk, preventing stockouts like P23 (demand42>sold37).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29, late July summer, women's everyday V-neck blouse). Low demand regime since P17 extended to 8 periods (P17-P24 demands: 27,43,30,22,25,33,42,24; avg=30.75, sustained ~30-33 despite P23 spike=42 and P24 dip=24). Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 24 observed (no losses, in-transit=0). On-hand=15 sufficient for partial demand but order to rebuild base stock. Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current low regime (N=max(min(regime_length=8,20),3)=8); L=default=0. Parameters target base stock ~30.75 + 0.84*std_recent8 (~37 total), balancing high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding cost with low inventory exposure.

Period 27 (2019-08-12), mid-August summer/end-of-summer, potential back-to-school demand uptick for women's everyday blouses (airy weave). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments\u2014all historical orders P1-P26 arrived same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed). Recent demand volatile: P22-P26 (33,42,24,41,61) avg=40.2 (up from overall mean~38.6), std~13.7; P26=61 caused stockout (prior order=39 insufficient). No new sustained changepoint (downward P17+ avg~30 extended but P25-P26 jump to 41/61 lacks 3rd period confirmation). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to boost mean/vol for higher base_stock (~40+0.84*14=51), improving service vs holding (q=0.8); L=default (promised=0 matches all observed).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19), late summer for airy V-neck blouse; recent demand spike signals potential seasonal peak or sales event: P25:41, P26:61, P27:118 (avg 73.3, +105% from P23-P24 avg 33), with stockouts (ending inv=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments; lead time consistently 0 across 27 periods. Changepoint at P25 upward shift (regime_length=3 periods). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to adapt to high mean/vol; default L=0. Parameters raise base_stock to ~73 + 0.84*~40 \u2248106, balancing high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding amid spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 25: avg increased from 35.7 (P23-P24:42,24,41? prior extended low ~30) to 73.3 (+105%) sustained over 3 periods (41,61,118)

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26, late summer/back-to-school potential for apparel). Lead time consistently 0 across 28 periods, no in-transit or losses. On-hand 68 from P28 arrival/order, covers several periods at avg ~40 but recent high regime (P25-P28: 41,61,118,39; avg 64.75, +115% vs prior ~30 per carry-over). P27 spike (118) caused stockout (sold 52), P28 drop to 39 but avg sustained high. No new changepoints (drop not sustained 3+ periods). Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to elevate base_stock for volatile high regime (mu~(1+0)*64.75, high sigma~35 from {41,61,118,39}), yielding ~65+0.84*35~85 total target; orders ~85-68=17 to buffer spikes vs holding, balancing q=0.8 service.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02, Labor Day Monday - potential apparel sales boost). On-hand=35 (low), in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time consistently 0 across all 29 periods). Recent demand P25-P29 (regime from P25): 41,61,118,39,61; mean=64 (+113% vs prior P17-P24 ~30), std~32 (volatile with spike at P27=118, dip P28=39). High regime sustained over 5 periods. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated mean/volatility over 1+L=1 period (mu~64, sigma~32); L=default (confirmed 0). Ensures base stock ~64 + 0.84*32 \u224891 to cover demand, minimize stockouts/holding vs profit ratio q=0.8.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 25 extended: avg 64 (+113% from P17-P24 ~30) sustained over 5 periods (41,61,118,39,61)

High demand regime from P25 (2019/7/29) sustained over 7 periods (P25-P31: 41,61,118,39,61,67,80; avg 66.7, +122% vs prior P17-P24 ~30), confirmed by recent P30=67, P31=80 both high. On-hand=9 low, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical lead times=0). L=default (promised 0 matches all observed). mu_hat=recent_7 and sigma_hat=recent_7 to capture elevated mean/volatility in current regime (std~27, driven by P27=118 spike but overall high). Ensures base_stock ~67 + z(0.8)*27 ~67+1.28*27~82 (for L=0), balancing high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding, covering expected demand to avoid stockouts/profit loss.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 25 extended: avg 66.7 (+122% from P17-P24 ~30) sustained over 7 periods (41,61,118,39,61,67,80)

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Late September, fall transition for women's everyday V-neck blouse; no major events imminent. On-hand=30 low vs recent demand~60-80, in-transit=0, all prior orders arrived LT=0 (no losses/overdues). High demand regime from P25-P32 sustained 8 periods (demands:41,61,118,39,61,67,80,60; avg=65.9, +122% vs prior low ~30), confirmed by carry-over. Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated mean/vol over 1+L=1 period (L=default=0 confirmed consistently). This raises base_stock=\u03bc\u0302 + 0.84*\u03c3\u0302 (q=4/5=0.8) to ~66 + 0.84*high_\u03c3, minimizing stockouts (frequent ending=0) while capping overage via backend policy; holding cost low relative to profit.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30), late September, potential fall fashion ramp-up for everyday women's blouse. Demand regime high since changepoint P25 (2019-07-29), sustained 9 periods P25-P33 with avg 73.6 (demands:41,61,118,39,61,67,80,60,135), +139% vs prior P17-P24 avg 30.8; recent P33 spike to 135 confirms volatility but sustained high mean. Lead time confirmed 0 periods across all 33 observed (every order arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/losses; must order proactively for high demand post-stockout. Use recent_N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target current regime (backend: mu_hat=73.6, sigma_hat~32); L=default (promised=0 confirmed). Supports high service (q=4/5=0.8, z\u22480.84) to capture profit amid spikes/vol while capping overstock via backend policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 25 extended: avg 73.6 (+139% from P17-P24 30.8) sustained over 9 periods (41,61,118,39,61,67,80,60,135)

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7), early fall for women's everyday V-neck blouse (airy weave, long sleeves suitable for transition). High demand regime since P25 (2019/7/29) extended to 10 periods (P25-P34 demands:41,61,118,39,61,67,80,60,135,70; avg=73.2, +139% from prior P17-P24 avg~30.8), sustained with P34=70 fitting the regime (within recent range post-spikes). No lead time issues: all 34 observed arrivals confirm L=0 (no in-transit, no losses). On-hand=32 low vs expected ~73 demand. Use recent_10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/volatility (backend: mu_hat=73.2, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*std~35); L=default (0). Balances high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding by targeting base stock ~73 + 0.84*35~95, ordering ~63 to cover demand post low inventory.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Mid-fall, women's everyday V-neck blouse; approaching Halloween but no strong seasonal spike evident yet. Demand high regime from P25 (2019/7/29) extended through P35 demand=57; 11-period avg=71.7 (41,61,118,39,61,67,80,60,135,70,57), +133% vs pre-P25 ~30, sustained with volatility from spikes. Lead time consistently 0 across 35 periods, no in-transit or losses. On-hand=43 covers ~1 period recent demand. Use recent_N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated mean/variance regime (N=regime_length=11); L=default (promised/observed=0). Higher mu/sigma raises base_stock for q=0.8 service level, prioritizing profit via reduced stockouts despite holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 25 extended: avg 71.7 (+133% from P17-P24 ~30.8) sustained over 11 periods (41,61,118,39,61,67,80,60,135,70,57)

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21, late October fall season; women's everyday V-neck blouse - steady fall demand expected, no major holidays immediate). Demand high regime since changepoint P25 extended through P36 (12 periods: 41,61,118,39,61,67,80,60,135,70,57,50; avg 69.9, +127% vs prior P17-24 avg 30.8). Lead time consistently 0 across all 36 periods (no in-transit, no losses/overdues; on-hand 47 matches P36 ending). Recent demand volatile (P36=50, but regime avg 70); on-hand 47 risks stockout if >47. Set L default=0 (confirmed). mu_hat recent_12 captures regime mean ~70 for (1+0) periods. sigma_hat recent_12 captures high vol ~32 (e.g., outliers 135,118). Backend base_stock ~70 + 0.84*32 \u224895 (q=4/5=0.8), order ~95-47-0=48: covers demand + safety, high service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 25 extended: avg 69.9 (+127% from P17-P24 30.8) sustained over 12 periods (41,61,118,39,61,67,80,60,135,70,57,50)

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28, late October, everyday women's V-neck blouse; potential pre-holiday stability but no strong seasonal driver evident). Demand high regime from changepoint at P25 (2019/7/29) extended to P37: 13 periods (41,61,118,39,61,67,80,60,135,70,57,50,33), avg ~67 (+118% from prior P17-P24 avg~30), sustained high despite single P37 dip to 33 (not yet a sustained shift). Lead time confirmed 0 across all 37 periods, no in-transit or losses; on-hand=62 sufficient for ~1-2 periods at recent levels. Use recent_13 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on high-demand regime (backend computes (1+0)*mean~67, sqrt(1+0)*std~35); L default=0. Parameters raise base_stock=67 + z(0.8)*35 ~110 (high service q=4/(4+1)=0.8) to cover volatile high demand, minimizing stockouts (lost profit) vs holding.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/04): Early November, approaching US Thanksgiving (Nov 28) and holiday season; women's everyday blouses likely see sustained/increasing demand in fall. Confirmed lead time=0 across all 38 periods, no losses, in-transit=0, on-hand=10 low vs recent demand. Ongoing high demand regime from P25 (2019/07/29) extended (P25-P38: 14 periods, mean=68.2, includes spikes 118/135/83 and dips 33/24 but avg +120% vs prior low ~30). P38 demand=83 high fits regime/volatility. Use recent_14 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/vol; L=default (confirmed 0). Ensures base_stock ~68 + z*sigma (q=4/5=0.8 high service) covers demand post-low inventory, minimizing stockout/holding.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18), pre-Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29); women's everyday blouses may see holiday shopping demand spike. On-hand 46, in-transit 0; all historical orders arrived with LT=0 (no losses/overdues). High demand regime from P25 (2019/07/29) sustained: P25-P40 (16 periods) demands avg ~65 (e.g., peaks 118,135; lows 33,24), volatile. Last 4 (P37-40):33,83,54,42 avg 53 but within high regime variance. Use recent_N N=16 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/volatility (changepoint P25 evidenced by +127% avg vs prior ~30, now 16 periods); L default (confirmed LT=0). This sets higher base_stock for service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding, covering ~65+volatility over 1 period while adapting to regime, preventing stockouts amid holiday risk.

High regime from P25 (7/29) sustained 17 periods avg ~63.6 (P25-P41), recent 12 P30-P41 avg 63.5 std~26.3, recent 5 P37-P41 avg 48.6 but volatile w/83 high & BF imminent - anticipate uplift to ~90. All 41 periods confirm L=0 (no losses/overdues), in-transit=0, on-hand=59 covers avg but risks stockout on spike. L=default (promised 0). mu_hat=explicit 90 for seasonal BF forecast. sigma_hat=recent_N N=12 for recent volatility. Raises base_stock~90+0.84*26~112 (order~53), balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2, Cyber Monday): Major holiday shopping peak for women's clothing like blouses, post-Black Friday (P42 11/25 demand=315, +916% from P41=31). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all historical LT=0 confirmed). Recent changepoint at P42: demand spike signaling sustained holiday surge (calendar: Thanksgiving Nov28, Cyber Mon Dec2, Christmas weeks P43-P47). Use recent_N=3 (P40-P42 demands 42/31/315; regime_length=1 -> N=max(min(1,20),3)=3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture spike/volatility (mu~129, sigma~161), yielding base_stock~129+0.84*161~264 to cover high demand/service (q=0.8) while capping overstock risk. L default (consistent 0). Addresses depletion by boosting forecast proactively for holidays.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09), peak Christmas shopping season (2 weeks to Dec 25); women's V-neck blouse likely high demand continuing Black Friday spike (P42:315 on 2019-11-25) and P43:144 (2019-12-02). On-hand=121, in-transit=0; no pending arrivals or overdue shipments (all historical lead times=0 confirmed). Recent changepoint at P42: demand from prior avg~52 (P33-P41:135,70,57,50,33,83,54,42,31) to recent_3 avg 163 (P41-P43:31,315,144; +213% jump, vol high std~143), holiday-driven. L=default (promised/actual 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 captures elevated regime (regime_length=2+, N=3 per guidance including transition); base_stock~163+0.84*143~283 (q=4/5=0.8), order~162 to target post-arrival inv covering high demand/min holding vs default all-history low mu~60/sigma~50 (risk major stockout on 121 if demand>150).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), pre-Christmas shopping week (Dec 16-22 includes peak holiday retail); women's blouse likely high demand ~100-150 similar to recent holiday highs (P42 BF 315, P43 144). On-hand 255, in-transit 0 covers expected demand + safety; no overdue/lost shipments (all 44 prior orders arrived LT=0). Sustained high demand regime since P25 (20 periods P25-P44 avg 78.5, +155% vs prior ~30.8) confirmed by recent avg and holiday spikes; use recent_N=20 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set mu_hat~(1+0)*78.5, higher sigma_hat for volatility (spikes like 315); L default (promised/observed 0). Ensures high base_stock ~78 + 0.84*sigma for holiday service level while high inv limits order to ~0, minimizing holding over final 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 25 extended to P44: avg 78.5 (+155% from P17-P24 30.8) sustained over 20 periods including holiday spikes (P42:315, P43:144)

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): Christmas Eve week for women's V-neck blouse; expect major demand spike continuing holiday pattern (P42 Black Friday 315, P43 144, P45 pre-Christmas 196). On-hand 59, in-transit 0 (no overdue/lost shipments; all historical lead times confirmed 0). Most recent changepoint: high demand regime since P25 (carry-over avg~78 over 20p), but recent holiday sub-regime P42-P45 shows escalation (demands 315,144,29,196; volatile sustained highs avg171 +118% vs prior regime). Use recent_N=5 (P41-P45:31,315,144,29,196 mean143 std~120; regime_length~5 >=3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture volatility/peaks proactively. L default (promised/actual 0). Backend base_stock~143 + 0.84*120~244 (q=4/5=0.8), order~185 to cover ~200+ demand post-arrival, balancing profit vs holding; high sigma adds safety for spike risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 25 extended to P45: avg 84.1 (+137% from P17-P24 ~30.8) sustained over 21 periods; holiday spikes escalating (P42:315, P43:144, P45:196 avg218)

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas/New Year's Eve; expect demand taper after holiday peaks (P42:315 Black Friday, P43:144, P45:196 pre-Christmas) but P46:71 remains elevated vs pre-P25 avg~30. Sustained high demand regime since P25 (22 periods to P46, avg~84 confirmed in carry-over). On-hand 174 covers expected ~70-100 demand with buffer; in-transit 0, no overdue/losses\u2014all prior orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0). No new changepoints. Use recent_20 (regime length 22, capped 20) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target (1+0)*recent avg~87 + z*high recent std (captures volatility from spikes/lows like 315/29), balancing service vs holding (q=4/5=0.8, z~0.84). L default (promised/observed 0). High on-hand will cap order low, minimizing holding cost.
