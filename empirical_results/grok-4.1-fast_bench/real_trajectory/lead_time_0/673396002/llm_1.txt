Fashion accessory likely year-round but possible minor demand lift near Valentine's Day (Feb 14, 2019, 3 days away) for gifting/outfit accessories; winter season (Feb) not a strong driver for belts vs. seasonal apparel. (b) Historical demand (5 weeks to 2019-02-04): 407,374,295,130,213; mean=284, high variance (declining then rebound); no sustained regime shift (insufficient evidence of 3+ periods trend); forecast ~280-300 for Period 1 continuity. (c) No prior orders/concludes; promised lead time 0; cannot infer actual yet, no missing orders to flag. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; empty pipeline exposes Period 1 demand risk. (e) Order historical mean rounded up to 300 for safety buffer (high profit $19 vs. low hold $1; covers expected demand + Valentine's uncertainty; lead time 0 expected to arrive same period pre-demand).",
