(b) Historical demand for this SKU: 15,50,198,60,68 (avg 78, median 60, recent 3-period avg 109 skewed by Jan21 spike; recent trend stabilizing ~64). No prior game periods, so forecast ~70-80 for Period 1, conservative due to volatility. (c) Promised LT=0; no conclude messages yet (Period 1 start), so no inference possible; no missing orders. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; empty pipeline, must order to cover Period 1 demand (arrivals post-decision but pre-demand if LT=0). (e) Order 80 units: matches recent demand avg/mode, covers expected ~70-80 with safety for volatility/Valentine's; high profit ($19) justifies modest overstock vs $1 hold cost; covers 1 period (L+1=1).",
