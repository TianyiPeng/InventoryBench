(c) No conclude messages; promised lead=0 (same-period arrival expected). No in-transit/overdues. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; pipeline empty. Must order to cover Period 1 demand (post-decision arrival). (e) Order 210: covers expected demand (~210) with minor safety buffer (profit=19 >> holding=1); avoids stockout loss while minimizing end-period hold. Reassess next period.",
