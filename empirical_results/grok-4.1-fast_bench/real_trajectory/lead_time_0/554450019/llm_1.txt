Year-round apparel, but Feb 2019 context: post-Chinese New Year (Feb 5), approaching Valentine's Day (Feb 14) and Presidents' Day (Feb 18, US sales potential). Jeans demand steady, possible minor uplift from holidays. (b) Demand regime: Historical weekly data (2019-01-07 to 02-04): 37,31,44,34,109. Mean ~50, but single 109 spike on 02-04 (pre-CNY?) not sustained (1 period only). No regime shift confirmed; forecast ~50 for 02-11, with upside risk. (c) Lead time: No concluded periods yet; promised 0. No inference possible. No missing orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0, in-transit 0. Period 1 starts empty; must order to cover immediate demand (arrivals post-decision, pre-demand). (e) Final order logic: Forecast 50-60 base (historical mean), buffer +20 for recent spike/holiday risk. Order 70: covers expected + safety (profit $19 >> holding $1), assumes L=0 for same-period coverage. Conservative for long horizon (47 periods).",
