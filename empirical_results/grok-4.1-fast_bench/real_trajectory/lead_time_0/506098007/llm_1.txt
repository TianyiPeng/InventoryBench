(c) Lead time: Confirmed 0 periods consistently across all 38 periods (every conclude: 'lead_time was 0 periods'); no in-transit or overdue/missing orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 20 (low), in-transit 0; Period 39 starts with 20, vulnerable to stockout (recent demands ~48 >20). (e) Final order logic: Forecast P39 demand ~55 (recent avg48 + modest Christmas anticipation buffer, avoiding P33-like outlier without current evidence); order 45 ensures total available 65 covers forecast + safety (std~8), expects ending ~10 (low holding $10 vs stockout loss ~$4*5=$20); balances profit max vs holding over remaining ~8 periods.",
