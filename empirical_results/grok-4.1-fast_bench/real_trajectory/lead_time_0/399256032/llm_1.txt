World knowledge: everyday jeans demand stable/low in late fall vs. holiday dresses/formal. (b) Demand regime: Confirmed late fall lows (P36-P40: 13,13,16,15,11; avg 13.6, max16; sustained extension of P36-P38 avg14, -55% from prior).

No missing orders. (d) Inventory: On-hand 22, in-transit 0. Covers 22/14\u22481.5 periods; prob stockout ~0 (22>>max recent 16). (e) Order logic: Lead=0 so reactive.
