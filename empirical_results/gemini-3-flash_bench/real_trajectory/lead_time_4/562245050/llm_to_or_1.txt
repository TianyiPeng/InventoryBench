Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Trousers). Historical demand for the last five weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows values of 97, 57, 65, 61, and 55. The average of these five samples is 67.0 with a standard deviation of 17.2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no observed arrivals yet, I will use the 'default' lead time method (which uses the promised L=4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the stable demand regime observed throughout January and early February, acknowledging the slight drop after the initial Jan 7 spike. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, targeting a critical ratio of approximately 0.95 ($19 / ($19 + $1)).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 96 units, but since the promised lead time is 4, zero units arrived (as expected), resulting in 45 lost sales because on-hand inventory was 0. The demand in Period 1 was 45. Five weeks of historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) show a mean of 67.0 and a standard deviation of 17.2. Adding the Period 1 demand of 45, the overall mean is 63.3 and std is 17.6. The product is women's skinny jeans. Mid-February usually sees stable demand before spring transitions. Given the lost sales, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) periods. Since we have zero lead-time arrival observations yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using all available data (N=6, including P1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 with a demand history showing a mean of approximately 65 units (based on both the provided data from Jan/early Feb and the most recent 2 periods). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 and P2 have not arrived yet, which is expected as they should arrive in P5 and P6 respectively. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales, which is unavoidable given the start-up phase and lead time. I will use the recent N method (N=5) to capture the demand mean of the last few weeks (approx 67.5). The OR backend calculates base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302. By setting mu_hat using recent_N, the backend will estimate demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Current in-transit units (189) are already being counted against the target by the OR backend.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product (Womens Everyday Trousers) has a promised lead time of 4. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (visible P6), hence the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a backlog of demand. Total in-transit (P1=96, P2=93, P3=81) is 270. Demand history (97, 57, 65, 61, 55, 45, 77, 134) shows a significant spike in Period 3 (134 units), which might be related to local seasonality/clearing (Late Feb/Early March). However, the preceding 5 samples averaged ~66 units. Given the stockout and the recent jump, I will use recent_N=3 for the demand forecast to capture the upward trend (average of 45, 77, 134 is ~85.3). L remains at default (4). The OR backend will calculate base stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last three periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is Women's skinny jeans. Looking at the demand history (samples: 97, 57, 65, 61, 55; game: 45, 77, 134, 124), demand significantly increased around Period 3/4. The average demand across these 9 data points is ~80 units/period, but the last 4 periods average ~95 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the order from Period 1 was placed at the decision phase of Period 1, with L=4, it should arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5. We will see the confirmation in the Period 5 conclude message (at the start of Period 6). On-hand is currently 0, with 430 units in transit (orders from P1-P4). Given the recent demand spike and the lead time, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the (1+L) periods of demand coverage. (1+4) * 95 = 475. For sigma, I'll use recent_N to capture the increased volatility of the recent period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 3: average demand increased from ~65 to ~100+ units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1824.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6. The product is a women's 5-pocket jeans (Everyday Collection), which shows a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 3. Historical demand for P1-P2 averaged 61 units, while P3-P5 averaged 130.6 units (+114%). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and we just confirmed this with the Period 1 order arriving in the Period 5 conclude message (4 periods). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (134) exceeded the arrival (96) in Period 5. We have 498 units in transit. Since L=4, the pipeline must cover 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime from P3-P5, as this matches the seasonal uptick for 'Womens Everyday' trousers transitioning into spring (March). Setting L to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is currently accurate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3 confirmed: average demand increased from ~61 to ~130 (+110%) sustained for 3 periods (P3-P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU 562245050 (Womens Everyday Trousers) has experienced a significant demand surge starting around Period 3. Historical demand samples (before P1) averaged ~67, while recent context (P3-P6) shows demand averaging 133 units [(134+124+134+141)/4]. This represents a 100% increase, likely due to seasonal transition into spring. Confirmed lead time is 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stockouts, with 546 units in transit (P3: 81, P4: 160, P5: 164, P6: 141). To address the new demand regime and compensate for stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the ~133/period average. Using L+1 (5 periods) for the base stock calculation, mu_hat should reflect demand of ~665 units over that window. Sigma_hat is also updated using recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility in this higher-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (Spring seasonality) confirmed: Period 3-6 average demand is 133 units (vs initial baseline ~67).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), demand for 'Luna skinny RW' jeans is in a strong uptrend, likely driven by Spring seasonality. The demand in Period 7 spiked to 210 units, significantly higher than the previous high-demand regime average of ~133. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have been stock-out constrained since Period 1. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 610 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). To capture this accelerating demand and avoid further lost sales, I will use a restricted window (recent_N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the high-demand period (P4-P7) which averages 152.25 units per period. Setting L to default (4) ensures the backend accounts for the promised lead time which matches observed behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed in Period 7: demand reached 210 units, pushing the P4-P7 average to ~152 units (+127% vs baseline).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's 5-pocket jeans item experiencing significant Spring seasonality demand growth. Historical lead times are stable at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). However, demand has accelerated sharply: P1-P4 avg was ~95, P5-P8 avg is 177 (+86%), with the most recent two periods (P7-P8) hitting 210 and 223 units. Current on-hand is 0, and we have incurred stockouts for 8 consecutive periods because arrivals based on older demand forecasts are insufficient for the current regime. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand period (avg ~177 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of approx 885 units (177 * (1+4)). The OR backend will calculate the order size based on this updated forecast minus the 667 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: P5-P8 average demand reached 177 units (+86% vs P1-P4), with a peak of 223 units in P8, confirming strong Spring seasonality for this category.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans) is demonstrating strong upward demand acceleration as we move through April, likely driven by spring fashion transitions. Current date is 2019/04/15. On-hand inventory is 0 due to demand (188 in P9) consistently exceeding recent arrivals (164 in P9). The system is currently in a stockout state despite rising order quantities. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods (P5 arrives in P9). I need to account for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The most recent 3-period demand average (P7-P9) is 207 units, which is significantly higher than the earlier baseline. To prevent further stockouts and capture the current demand trend, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 samples to capture the peak and sigma_hat similarly to reflect current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: P7-P9 average demand is 207 units per period (+56% vs P3-P5 average of 133), confirming peak Spring seasonality for denim.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245050' (washed superstretch denim jeans) is in its peak Spring demand period (late April). Demand remains consistently high, with a 3-period average (P8-P10) of 206 units and a 5-period average (P6-P10) of 193.8 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P5 through P10). However, the system is consistently stocking out (ending on-hand inventory = 0 for 6 consecutive periods), indicating that the OR backend's service level calculation is being constrained by either the cap or an underestimated variance. Given the product descriptions (Womens Everyday Collection - superstretch denim), demand is likely near its seasonal ceiling but remains volatile. I will use N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while allowing for the recent slight softening from the peak of 223 (P8) to 207 (P10). This provides a demand-per-period estimate of ~194, resulting in a (1+L) mu_hat of ~970.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW jeans' is in its peak Spring demand period (late April). Demand has consistently trended upward, reaching 270 units in Period 11. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with sales restricted by stockouts for seven consecutive periods. The observed lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the persistent stockouts and the date (2019/4/29), demand is likely near or at its seasonal peak. I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period window (P8-P11) which averages 222 units per period. This results in an explicit (1+L) * mu calculation of (1+4) * 222 = 1110. For sigma_hat, I will use recent volatility to allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to capture the unmet demand and mitigate further lost sales during this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak confirmed for Spring denim season: Average demand for Period 8-11 is 222 units (+67% vs Period 3-6 average of 133). Persistent stockouts suggest actual demand may exceed observed sales when inventory is available.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim item (skinny jeans) experiencing a sustained demand peak consistent with Spring seasonality. Over the last 5 periods (P8-P12), demand has averaged 222.8 units (223, 188, 207, 270, 206), compared to the earlier baseline. We have faced significant stockouts, meaning actual demand is likely higher than sold units. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P12 conclude message showing the P8 order arrived exactly on schedule). Despite a slight dip in demand in Period 12, the average remains high. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the observed consistency. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand Spring regime (average ~223) across the review+lead time (1+L = 5 periods). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current volatility of this peak season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2636.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May. Historical data shows demand for this denim SKU peaked in late April (Period 11, demand 270) and has started to decelerate in the last two periods (Period 12 demand: 206, Period 13 demand: 145). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 13. Demand over the last 4 periods (P10-P13) has averaged 207 units, which is a better representation of the current 'high-season' level than the long-term average, despite the recent drop. To prevent over-ordering as the Spring peak potentially passes while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost implies a ~95% target service level), I will use the average of the last 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent peak with the most recent cooling signal.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. We are analyzing 'Luna skinny denim jeans', which have exhibited strong Spring seasonality. Historical demand peaked around Periods 8-11 (late April) with an average of approximately 222 units. Recent demand (Periods 12-14) has moderated slightly to 180 units average (206, 145, 189). The 'conclude' messages confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. There are no missing shipments. Current on-hand inventory is 167 with 867 units in-transit. Since we are moving past the peak Spring season for jeans but still in a high-demand period compared to the initial baseline, I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the normalization of demand (avg ~199 units per period). This N=5 captures the tail end of the peak and the recent transition, providing a balanced forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak Spring (Periods 12-14) has stabilized around an average of 180 units, transitioning from the peak of 220+ units seen in Periods 8-11.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. This SKU is a pair of women's skinny jeans. Demand data from the last 4 periods (P12-P15: 206, 145, 189, 199) shows a slight cooling from the April peak but remains high, averaging 184.75 units. This aligns with the transition from peak spring to late spring/early summer. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods as promised. On-hand inventory is 203 with 781 in-transit. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-peak stabilization level (avg ~185) while ensuring the backend captures the current volatility. Parameters L=4, mu_hat uses N=4 (approx 925 for 1+L), and sigma_hat uses N=4 to manage the recent variance as we transition seasons.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization post-Spring peak: Average demand for Period 12-15 is ~185 units, down from the peak average of ~222 in Period 8-11.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. We are in the post-peak Spring denim season. Demand in the most recent periods (P13-P16) has been 145, 189, 199, and 237, with an average of 192.5 units. While Period 16 showed a surprising uptick to 237, the overall trend from the April peak (averaging ~220) has stabilized. The current on-hand inventory (239) and in-transit (549) total 788 units. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 17 plus the 4-period lead time (5 periods total). Using an average of ~195 units/period, the target base stock is approximately 975 units. The OR backend will calculate the order based on my parameters. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-peak demand regime (Periods 13-16). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion messages from P5 through P16.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Observed demand in Period 16 (237) was higher than the post-peak average (~180), suggesting either a late-season spike or higher volatility. Average demand for the last 4 periods (P13-P16) is 192.5 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 10, 2019 (Period 18). We are managing a women's skinny denim product. Historically, demand exhibited a significant spring peak from late March to early May (Periods 7-11), reaching over 200 units per period. Since Period 12, demand has transitioned to a summer phase, fluctuating between 145 and 237 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is 191.4 units. The 'Period 17 conclude' message shows an ending on-hand inventory of 252 units and a pipeline of 604 units. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods as promised (P13 order arrived in P17). Given the recent data, the demand seems to have stabilized around the 185-195 range after the initial spring peak. I will use a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization while accounting for the recent variance seen in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed post-Spring peak: Average demand for Period 13-17 is 191.4 units, maintaining a level significantly higher than the pre-peak baseline but lower than the April peak (~220+).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17, transitioning from the Spring peak season for womens denim skinny jeans into summer. Demand for the last 5 periods (P14-P18) has averaged 170.6 units, showing a gradual cooling from the peak April average of ~220. The most recent demand (P18) was 141, the lowest in 10 periods, suggesting the downward trend is materializing as we move further into June. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 270 and a substantial pipeline of 667, the objective is to align base stock with this lower demand regime to avoid excess holding costs. Since demand is currently in a state of transition (post-peak stabilization/decline), I am using N=5 for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the recent cooling trend while still protecting against the high service level requirements of a high-margin item ($19/$1).

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand cooling trend detected in June. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is 170.6, down from the Spring peak average (~220).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24. Historical demand analysis shows a transition from the Spring peak (~220 units) to a fairly stable Summer regime. Last 5 periods (P15-P19) demand: 199, 237, 187, 141, 218. Average of the last 5 periods is 196.4 units. While P19 showed a spike to 218, the overall trend in June has been slightly lower and more volatile than the April peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 201 and in-transit at 661 units, the pipeline is well-stocked. We will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~196 units/period), as N=3 would be too volatile and N=10 would include the higher April peak. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. This configuration ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock covering approximately 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Spring peak: Average demand for Period 15-19 is 196.4 units, showing a shift from the ~220 peak to a more volatile summer level.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (skinny denim jeans) is currently in a post-peak summer phase (July 1st). Comparing the Spring peak (Periods 8-11 avg: 222) with the recent summer performance (Periods 16-20 avg: 183.8), demand has cooled but remains volatile with a significant spike in Period 19 (218). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 106, while a large pipeline of 874 units is in transit, including a significant order of 255 from Period 17 expected to arrive in Period 21. Given the profit ($19) vs. holding cost ($1) ratio, the OR backend targets approximately a 95% service level. I will use a recent_N of 5 periods (Periods 16-20) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the current summer demand regime and its associated volatility while ignoring the early-year ramp-up data which is no longer relevant.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear cooling trend from the Spring peak (~220 units) as we enter the summer season. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 160 units, which is a significant reduction from the high-season levels. The product is 'Womens Everyday Collection' skinny jeans, which typically sees its highest demand in Spring and Fall, with a slight dip in mid-summer. Lead times remain consistent at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 243 units and 724 units in-transit, we are well-covered for the current trend. To adjust for the summer cooling, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower demand average of ~160, and sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand cooling confirmed: Average demand for Periods 17-21 is 160 units, down from the Spring peak average of ~220 units (-27%).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (womens denim trousers) has shown a clear cooling trend since the Spring peak (April-May). Period 22 demand was significantly lower at 90 units, continuing the decline observed in Period 21 (118). A 'Summer cooling' regime is now well-established. Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), average demand has dropped to approximately 140 units, compared to the ~200+ peak. Seasonal patterns for denim often exhibit a mid-summer lull before a potential back-to-school uptick in late August. On-hand inventory is healthy at 375 units, and 502 units are in-transit (reflecting orders from P19-P21). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the cooling demand and significant pipeline inventory, the goal is to prevent overstocking during this low-demand phase. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the cooling trend while balancing the volatility seen in P19.

Carry-over insight: High-summer demand lull confirmed: Average demand for Periods 19-22 has dropped to 140.5 units, a 36% decrease from the Spring peak (~220 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2042.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (womens everyday denim) is currently experiencing a summer demand cooling phase following the Spring peak. Demand in the most recent period (P23) was 128 units, and the average for the last four periods (P20-P23) is 118 units, a significant decrease from the peak levels (>200) observed in April/May. The current inventory position is high: On-hand is 390 units and In-transit is 361 units (total 751). With demand slowing, the existing pipeline is more than sufficient to cover multiple lead times. The Lead Time is stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent lower demand regime, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility. This configuration will naturally lead to a very low or zero order because the current inventory exceeds the calculated target base stock for the cooling market.

Carry-over insight: Summer cooling regime confirmed (P20-P23): Demand has dropped to an average of ~118 units from the Spring peak average of ~220 units (-46%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1736.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245050' (Women's skinny jeans) has clearly moved into a lower-demand summer regime. Since Period 20, demand has averaged ~118 units, a significant drop from the Spring peak (~220 units) and even the post-peak transition (~180 units). The most recent demand (Period 24) was 119 units, confirming this lower, steadier regime. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 525 units on-hand and 107 in-transit (Total pipeline = 632), and current demand projections around 120 units/period, we have over 5 periods of inventory coverage (L+1 = 5). No substantial new orders are needed to satisfy the current regime's requirements, but mu_hat and sigma_hat must be recalibrated to reflect the lower mean and variance of the last 5 periods (N=5) to prevent over-ordering in the underlying OR logic. N=5 captures the regime starting at P20.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. The SKU (denim jeans) is well past its Spring peak (~220 units) and has entered a late-summer seasonal cooling phase. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is 105.8 units, significantly lower than the P15-P19 average (~196 units). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 556 units, which is extremely high given the cooling demand (over 5 weeks of coverage). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal now is to allow the existing excess inventory to burn off. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 periods) to reflect the current 106-unit demand level, which will signal the OR backend that no significant new orders are needed until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand cooling shift: Average demand for P21-P25 has dropped to 106 units, a ~50% decrease from the Spring peak (~220 units).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (denim trousers) is currently in a late-summer seasonal cooling phase (August). Demand has consistently declined from the spring peak (~220 units) to a recent average of approximately 88 units over the last 5 periods (P22-P26: 90, 128, 119, 74, 56). The most recent demand was 56 units. On-hand inventory is high at 500 units, which is significantly more than 5 periods of supply at current demand rates. The lack of an arrival in Period 26 is expected because the order from Period 22 was 0 units. The pipeline inventory is very low (57 units), but the current on-hand excess (500 units) more than covers the target base stock. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for both demand mean and volatility to capture this sustained cooling trend while maintaining a buffer for the high variance observed in summer months. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent historical arrival pattern.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand cooling confirmed (P22-P26): Average demand has dropped to 93 units, a ~58% decrease from the Spring peak (~220 units). Period 26 demand of 56 units is the lowest since the initial baseline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Luna skinny RW' (women's denim) continues its late-summer cooling trend. Period 27 demand was 71 units, and the average demand for the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is 89.6 units, a significant decrease from the spring peak (~220 units). Current on-hand inventory is 431 units, which is approximately 4.8 periods of supply based on the recent average, without even accounting for the 76 units already in transit. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P23 order arrived in P27). To prevent excess inventory and minimize holding costs during this low-demand phase, I am using a recent_N calculation (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (approx. 90 units/period). This will lead the OR engine to place minimal or zero new orders until the existing stock is depleted to a level consistent with current demand.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand stabilization: Average demand for P23-P27 has settled at 89.6 units, confirming a sustained low-demand regime compared to early summer.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (August 26), the demand for this SKU (women's skinny denim) has stabilized into a late-summer low-demand regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is 69.4 units, which is significantly lower than the Spring peak (~220 units) and even the early summer stabilization (~118 units). Current on-hand inventory is 358 units with 135 units in transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we must protect against demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). The current pipeline (493 units) is more than sufficient to cover this low-demand phase (5 * ~70 = 350 units), though we must maintain a buffer for potential early-autumn demand shifts. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this most recent cooling trend for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand stabilization confirmed: Period 24-28 average demand is 69.4 units, representing a significant drop from both the Spring peak and early summer levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday denim) continues its late-summer cooling trend. In Period 29, demand was 63 units, which is consistent with the recent low-demand regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is 67.4 units, showing significant stabilization far below the Spring peak of ~220. Regarding supply, the 'lead_time was 4 periods' remains consistent based on P29's arrival of the P25 order. However, the order from Period 22 (0 units) and Period 24 (0 units) did not result in arrivals, which is expected. The order from P26 (32 units) is expected to arrive in Period 30. Current on-hand inventory (318) and in-transit (112) are sufficient to cover current demand levels, leading to a recommended zero order (cap-driven by OR). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the contemporary low-demand regime and use default for L and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime stabilized (P25-P29): Average demand is 67.4 units, a ~70% reduction from Spring peak levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans) has successfully transitioned from its spring peak (avg ~220) and high-summer volatility to a stable late-summer/early-autumn regime. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30) is 66.6 units, reflecting a significant and sustained cooling trend since the August transition. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods (P26 order arrived in P30). The current on-hand inventory (280) plus in-transit stock (221) is 501 units, which is high relative to the current demand regime. With L=4 (covering 5 periods), the inventory position is roughly 501 / 67 \u2248 7.5 periods of supply. Therefore, the goal is to set parameters that represent this new lower-demand baseline (N=5 for mu_hat) while allowing for typical retail volatility (N=5 for sigma_hat). Given the high starting stock, the OR backend's inventory cap will likely limit new orders until the levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/early-autumn stabilization confirmed (P26-P30): Demand has settled into a new regime with an average of ~67 units per period, down 70% from the spring peak.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' superstretch denim has stabilized into a late-summer/early-autumn regime. Over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), the average demand is 64.1 units, significantly lower than the spring peak of ~220. The current date is mid-September, a period where denim often sees a secondary 'back-to-school' or 'autumn transition' uptick, though no significant spike is visible in the data yet. On-hand inventory is 249 units with 200 units in-transit (orders from P28 and P30). The order from P28 (59 units) is expected to arrive in P32, and the order from P30 (141 units) in P34. With a combined inventory position of 449 units and a lead time of 4 periods, we are currently covered for ~7 periods at the current demand rate (~64 units/period). I will set L to 'default' as lead times have been consistently 4 periods. mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current stable low-demand regime (avg ~64) while providing resilience against potential autumn demand increases. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' for N=6 to reflect current volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 is in a late-autumn stabilization phase following its spring peak. Current date is Sep 23, 2019. Demand has shifted from a high of ~220 units in spring to a stable average of approximately 60.4 units over the last 5 periods (P28-P32). On-hand inventory is 261 units, and 141 units (ordered in P30) are in transit, totaling 402 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to recent demand (approx. 4 weeks of coverage), no new order is required this period. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this low-demand autumn regime, as demand has been consistently below 80 units since Period 25. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the significant decrease in mean demand and variance, preventing unnecessary overstocking and minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized (P26-P32): Average demand is 61.7 units per period, consistently around 60-70 units, confirming the completion of the summer cooling trend.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand has stabilized into an autumn regime with the average for the last 8 periods (P26-P33) being approximately 62.6 units per period. The late-summer cooling trend has concluded, and we are now seeing stable, lower demand compared to the spring peak. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the most recent concrete arrivals (P27 and P28 orders arrived in P31 and P32 respectively). Although the P22 order (ordered=0) and P24 order (ordered=0) result in 'arrived=0' messages, this is expected behavior. However, the ordering pattern from P29-P33 (0, 141, 0, 0, 0) suggests the OR backend is managing a surplus. On-hand inventory is 192 units and in-transit is 141 units (placed in P30). The current total coverage is 333 units, which at the current demand rate (~63 units/period) covers over 5 periods. I will set L to 4 and mu_hat to reflect the current 63-unit regime to prevent over-ordering while maintaining the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' jeans has reached a stable autumn regime (Period 26 onwards) following a significant cooling from the spring/summer peaks. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P26-P34) is 55.6 units, reflecting a post-summer slowdown. On-hand inventory is currently high at 286 units, which is more than sufficient to cover anticipated demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). A lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with the history. To prevent further accumulation of excess inventory and minimize holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this lower volume regime accurately. The OR backend will naturally reduce ordering as on-hand plus pipeline inventory exceeds the target base stock calculated from these lower demand parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $334.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-October (Period 36). Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward trend from the Spring peak (~220 units) to a stabilized Autumn regime of approximately 60 units (observed average P26-P35 is 58 units). The most recent period (P35) showed a further drop to 31 units, which may be a temporary dip or a transition into a 'Late Autumn/Early Winter' lower-demand phase. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (255) relative to recent demand, which safely covers near-term needs. To avoid escalating holding costs while maintaining a service level for the upcoming weeks, I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (P26-P35) to capture this lower regime (N=10 results in an average demand of ~58 per period, whereas the total series average is significantly higher). Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 10 periods to reflect the reduced volatility of this lower-volume phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Autumn demand has stabilized at a lower level; average demand for P26-P35 is 57.6 units, compared to the previously established regime of ~67 units (P26-P30). This represents a further ~15% softening as the season progresses.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-10-21 (Autumn). Demand has stabilized in a low-demand regime following the Spring/Summer peak. Analysis of the last 11 periods (P26-P36) shows an average demand of 56 units per period, consistently oscillating between 31 and 73 units. The most recent 5-period average (P32-P36) is 46.8, suggesting a slight continued softening as we move deeper into the off-season. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 215 units, which covers approximately 4-5 periods of current demand. In-transit inventory is 85 units (orders from P34, P35, P36). Combined, the total inventory position is 300 units, which is ample for the current trend. To reflect the stabilized low-demand regime and avoid overstocking during this seasonal lull, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10), capturing the post-summer stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized (P26-P36): Average demand is 56.1 units per period, confirming a sustained low-level regime (~75% reduction from Spring peaks).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (denim trousers) is currently in a stable low-demand regime typical of late autumn. The average demand over the last 12 periods (P26-P37) is approximately 53.5 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P33-P37) averaging 45.8 units, indicating a slight further cooling. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods. Inventory levels are currently healthy (On-hand: 173, In-transit: 122). With an on-hand balance that covers nearly 4 weeks of demand at the current rate, and a significant pipeline, the focus is on maintaining a lean stock to minimize holding costs while protecting against minor volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the stabilized autumn demand level, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=12 to account for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $590.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November (Period 39), following a prolonged stabilization of demand in the range of 30-50 units per period (Autumn regime). Demand has significantly softened from the early Autumn levels (~60-70 units) to a current 10-period trailing average of approximately 48 units. Most recent demand (P34-P38) is even lower at 39.8 units. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods, with the P34 order arriving exactly as expected in P38. High on-hand inventory (151) and in-transit units (138) totaling 289 units provide approximately 6-7 periods of cover based on current consumption, which is more than sufficient for the 4-period lead time. Operating under a recent regime (N=13, covering P26 onwards) for mu_hat will allow the OR engine to capture the decrease while maintaining a buffer for late-season variability. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Late-Autumn demand further softened; average demand for P34-P38 is ~40 units, down from the P26-P33 average of ~61 units (-34%).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a stabilized late-autumn demand regime for women's denim trousers. Demand has consistently softened since the summer cooling, descending from a peak of 220+ units to a recent average of approximately 41 units over the last 5 periods (P35-P39: 31, 40, 42, 39, 46). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from P34 and P35 arriving exactly in P38 and P39. Inventory levels are currently healthy: on-hand (146) and in-transit (130) total 276 units, which covers more than 6 periods of supply at current demand levels. I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this stable, lower-demand autumn trajectory while maintaining enough safety stock for potential late-year minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter low-demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P34-P39 is 40.8 units per period, representing a ~80% decrease from Spring peaks.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (womens everyday denim) is currently in a low-demand late-autumn/winter regime. The recent demand (P34-P40) has averaged 43.4 units per period, which is significantly lower than the P1-P30 averages. Period 40 showed a slight uptick to 59 units, possibly related to early holiday shopping or pre-winter sales, but not yet indicative of a full regime shift. On-hand inventory is 114 units with 103 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39). Lead times are stable at 4 periods. Given the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), but the current transition into the end-of-year period, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (P34-P40) to capture this low-demand state while remaining sensitive to the slight volume increase in P40. This N=7 covers the detected regime shift identified in the carry-over insights.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, entering the late-autumn/early-winter season. Historically, demand has stabilized into a low-volume regime since late summer. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 42.4 units, consistent with the Autumn/Winter low-demand regime noted in previous insights (approx. 40 units). On-hand inventory is 125 units with 98 units in-transit (orders from P38, P39, and P41). Since the lead time is 4 periods, we are well-covered for the next several weeks. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime (approx. P34-P41), which reflects the current late-season behavior while excluding the higher autumn baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P34-P37 reached destination in 4 periods), so the default method is appropriate.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Period 42 showed a significant demand spike of 130 units, far exceeding the recent 'Autumn/Winter low-demand regime' average of ~41 units. This spike coincides with the start of the holiday shopping season (post-Black Friday/Early December). While the previous 6 periods (P36-P41) averaged 42 units, this sudden jump to 130 suggests a seasonal transition. However, I must be careful not to over-react to a single point. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (averaging P38-P42: 39, 46, 59, 26, 130 = 60 units) to capture the upward trend without assuming 130 is the new constant baseline. Sigma_hat is set to explicit because the recent variance is extremely high due to the jump from 26 to 130. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent history (P38-P42 arrivals all confirms L=4).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand jumped to 130 units (+218% vs P34-P41 avg), signaling a seasonal shift into December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (denim trousers) is experiencing a seasonal shift associated with the December holiday period. Period 42 saw a massive spike to 130 units (from a baseline of ~40), and although Period 43 demand dropped to 30, this is likely a temporary lull or a reporting artifact before the final pre-Christmas push. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43). Given the current date (Dec 9th) and the high demand seen in Period 42, I expect elevated demand for the next 2-3 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to reflect an expected weekly average of ~110 units for the next 5 periods (L+1), accounting for the recent spike while tempering for the post-holiday drop-off. Sigma_hat is set explicitly higher to manage the increased volatility seen in the transition from P41 (26 units) to P42 (130 units). Current on-hand (31) and in-transit (147) are relatively low given the spike potential, so this will trigger a necessary replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: Period 42 jump to 130 units followed by Period 43 drop to 30 suggests high variance during the December holiday season for denim.

Daily Reward (R_t): $589.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (mid-December) shows the SKU is currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) following a volatile period where demand spiked to 130 (P42) and then settled (30-37 in P43-P44). The missing arrival in Period 44 (which should have been the order from P40, though P40 was 0 units) confirms the pipeline is thin. Based on the holiday demand spike seen in Period 42, I anticipate further holiday-related volatility or spikes as Christmas approaches (Dec 16 date). The demand for P42-P44 has averaged ~66 units, which is significantly higher than the late-autumn average (~40). I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture this holiday shift for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=3) to account for the high variance (spike of 130 vs 30). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (December): Period 42-44 average demand is 65.7 units, a 60% increase over the P34-P41 autumn average of 40.8 units, characterized by high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $608.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the Christmas and end-of-year holiday season. Historically, Period 42 showed a massive spike (130 units), likely for Black Friday/Pre-Christmas shopping. The last two periods (44, 45) have resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), which masks the true latent demand during this high-traffic period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 494 units in-transit. Order arrivals have been consistent with a 4-period lead time, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 41 order in Period 45. However, the Period 40 order (placed Nov 11) is notably absent (ordered=0, but we also didn't see a 'conclude' message for a small or zero shipment that might have been expected if the system was flushing), although we expect Period 42's order (21 units) to arrive in Period 46. To address the stockout and the high holiday demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat (averaging the recent volatile holiday demand including the spike) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the high December variance. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (4), as the physical arrivals keep confirming the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: P42-P45 shows high volatility with a significant peak (130 units) and recent stockouts, suggesting latent demand is higher than observed sales (32-37 units) in P44-P45.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the end-of-year holiday season (Period 47, Dec 30). Historical demand during December has been highly volatile, with a significant spike of 130 units in Period 42 followed by lower sales constrained by stockouts in Periods 44-45. Period 46 saw a slight cooling (19 units sold), but on-hand inventory remains critically low (2 units). There is a large pipeline of 473 units (including orders from P43, P44, and P45). Specifically, the order from P43 (94 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P47), as observed lead times have consistently been 4 periods. Given the transition from the end of the holiday season to January, I expect demand to revert toward the autumn baseline (~40-60 units) but with continued volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5, covering the holiday window) to capture this higher mean/variance, and a slightly higher N for sigma_hat (N=10) to account for the extreme volatility observed since mid-November. The backend will use these to maintain a base stock that bridges the inventory gap until the large pipeline arrives.
