Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a fitted strappy top (jersey basic), which is a spring/summer seasonal item. Historical demand from the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 31.8 units/week with a slight upward trend in early February (last sample 36). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no inventory on-hand or in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current demand level of approximately 32 units/week. The OR backend will compute the base stock for (L+1) = 5 periods to cover demand until the first shipment arrives.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Fitted strappy top', a basic jersey item. Historical demand (5 samples: 28, 31, 39, 25, 36) yields an average of 31.8 units/week. Period 1 demand was 49, which is significantly higher (+54%) than the historical average, though it's the first data point for February. The promised lead time (L) is 4. An order of 42 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we lost sales in Period 1, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the recent spike in P1, I will use a conservative approach combining historical data with the recent observation. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (capturing all 5 historical samples plus the Period 1 observation) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the recent demand jump suggests the mean and variance might be higher than the pre-game samples suggest.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a 'Fitted strappy top', a product category (tank tops) that typically sees increased demand as spring approaches in the Northern Hemisphere. Historical samples show demand increasing: Jan (28, 31, 39, 25) to Feb (36, 49, 57). The last two periods (49, 57) indicate a clear upward trend compared to the earlier Jan average (~31). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 91 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals were expected yet. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the recent growth (Avg of 36, 49, 57 = 47.33). With L=4, mu_hat = (1+L)*47.33 = 236.65. I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to account for the increased volatility in the recent upward move.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a basic jersey tank top. Since the start of simulated history (Feb 11), we have faced a 100% stockout because the promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (Period 1) is not expected until Period 5's arrival phase. However, observed demand is increasing significantly: 49, 57, 84 (average 63.3, but trending up). This upward trend correlates with the transition into Spring (March), a peak season for 'Fitted strappy tops'. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this rising demand trend and set L to default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead time shift. The pipeline (156 units) covers approximately 2.5 periods of recent demand, so we need to continue ordering to build the base stock before the first arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: February demand (samples provided: 28, 31, 39, 25, 36; mean ~32) has increased significantly in late Feb/early March (samples: 49, 57, 84; mean 63.3) as the season shifts to Spring.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'fitted strappy top', a seasonal item for spring/summer. The current period is March 11. Initial demand history (Jan/early Feb) averaged ~32. Starting from Feb 11 (Period 1), demand surged to 49, 57, 84, and then 53 (average ~61). We have 250 units in transit but 0 on-hand due to the 4-period lead time. Our first order (Period 1) is expected to arrive during the current Period 5 (visibility in Period 6). To capture the spring regime shift, I am using recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the demand patterns from Feb 11 onwards. L is set to default (4), as we have not yet observed any completed delivery cycles to suggest a drift from the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $518.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Fitted strappy top', a spring/summer seasonal item. Since late February (Period 1), demand has surged with values of 49, 57, 84, 53, and 28. While Period 5 showed a dip to 28, the overall mean since Period 1 is 54.2, compared to the pre-period mean of ~32. The promised lead time of 4 periods was confirmed by the Period 1 order arriving in Period 5. On-hand inventory is low (14) due to late arrivals and early stockouts, but a large pipeline (295) is in transit. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the higher spring demand regime while acknowledging the recent volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased average demand and the higher variance observed in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Spring demand regime remains higher than initial historical samples, though volatile (P1-P5 mean: 54.2 vs initial mean: 31.8).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/3/25. The product is a 'fitted strappy top', a spring/summer seasonal item. We are currently in a high-demand regime compared to the Jan/Early Feb historical data. Observed demand in the last six periods (49, 57, 84, 53, 28, 78) averages 58.1, whereas the historical mean was ~32. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P6) because early orders (P1 and P2) were too small for the actual demand surge. Orders from P3 (65), P4 (94), and P5 (87) are in-transit and expected to arrive in P7, P8, and P9 respectively. To capture the current spring demand level and protect against volatility, I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the 58.1 mean and the increased variance. Setting L to default (which is 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1235.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Fitted strappy top' (Anita Tank), which is a spring/summer seasonal item. We are currently at Period 8 (April 1st). Since February (Period 4), we have seen a significant demand shift from an initial mean of ~32 to a 'Spring' mean of ~60.1 (averaging P1-P7 demand: 49, 57, 84, 53, 28, 78, 72). However, recent periods P6 and P7 show even higher demand (78 and 72), suggesting a sustained upward trend as weather warms. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory is 301 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). On-hand is 0 due to stockouts in P6 and P7, indicating our past base stock was too low for actual demand spikes. I will set L=4 (promised and confirmed). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 (covering the entire Spring regime since Feb 11) to capture the higher mean (~60) compared to history (~32). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=7 to account for high volatility (sigma is ~18.5 in the recent regime, much higher than the initial historical data).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime remains strong and volatile as of April (P5-P7 demand: 28, 78, 72). Mean demand since shift (P1-P7) is 60.1, a near 100% increase over pre-Feb data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1526.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th. The product is a tank top (fitted strappy top), which is highly seasonal as we move deeper into the Spring/Summer season. Historical samples before Period 1 averaged ~32 units. Since then (Periods 1-8), the mean demand has risen to 62.8 units per week, confirming the Spring demand regime noted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 78, 72, 81) averages 77 units, suggesting a sustained and potentially increasing peak as the weather warms. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (validated in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). I will set L to 4 (promised/calculated) and use the last 8 periods (N=8) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime established since mid-February while ignoring the lower winter base. The pipeline (278 units) is healthy, but current high demand (~80/week) over the 5-period horizon (L+1) requires approximately 400 total units (inventory + pipeline) to avoid stockouts.

Carry-over insight: April demand (Periods 6-8) is consistently high (mean 77.0), showing a further increase from the early Spring average of 63.3. Demand for this jersey tank top is accelerating into the summer season.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a jersey tank top, which is entering peak seasonality as we move into late April and early summer. Period 9 demand was 64, slightly lower than the recent average but still significantly higher than initial historical benchmarks (~32). Since Period 5, when the first order arrived, the mean demand has been 65.2 units per period (P5: 28, P6: 78, P7: 72, P8: 81, P9: 64). The actual lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P5 order arrived P9). Given the seasonality and high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), it is critical to maintain a high service level. The OR engine needs parameters reflective of this high-demand, high-volatility Spring/Summer regime. I will use recent_N=5 (covering the most recent full-cycle demand since inventory resumed) to capture the current mean (~65) and variance, ensuring the (L+1) window (5 periods) is sufficiently covered.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (Spring/Summer) confirmed: Average demand from P5-P9 is 65.2 units, a 100% increase over pre-Feb data, with high volatility (std dev ~22). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is an 'Anita Tank,' a jersey tank top, which is experiencing a strong seasonal demand upswing as we move deeper into the Spring/Summer months (current date: April 22). Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged 61.6 units, compared to the initial historical mean of ~32 units. Recent demand (Periods 6-10) is 69.4 units, showing stabilization at a higher level compared to the initial Spring surge but maintaining significant volatility (std dev ~13.5). The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods (L=4). To account for the shift in the demand regime and ensure the OR backend captures the current seasonal level rather than the lower historical samples, I will use a N=10 period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire period since the initial surge began in February, providing a robust estimate of the new 'summer' mean while respecting the observed high volatility. The base stock calculation (L+1 periods of demand) needs to cover approximately 300-350 units of pipeline inventory, which we are currently managing with 330 units in-transit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 692226004 (Anita Tank) is currently in its peak Spring/Summer season (late April). Demand has shifted significantly from the pre-Feb baseline (~32 units) to a new regime. Over the last 5 periods (P7-P11), mean demand is 69.0 units (72, 81, 64, 50, 78). Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods across multiple arrivals (P5-P11). While there is a slight inventory buffer (28 on-hand), the backend OR logic subtracts the massive 267 units in-transit from the calculated base stock. Because the in-transit amount is high (due to high orders in P8, P9, and P10 arriving shortly), I will use 'recent_5' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the 69.0 avg demand. This ensures the base stock reflects the current seasonal average (69.0 * (1+4) = 345 units) vs the high pipeline. Using recent_5 for sigma_hat captures the current volatility (std dev ~13 over the last 5 periods).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a jersey tank top, entering the peak summer season (May). Analyzing demand from Period 5 onwards (the established high-demand regime), the mean is 68.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 28.6. Period 12 showed a significant peak of 126 units, confirming that demand is accelerating as we move into warmer months. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 286 units in transit (ordered in Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should target a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the modern high-demand regime (P5-P12) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat set to 30 to account for the increasing volatility seen in the latest period (hit 126).

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed in May: P12 reached 126 units, the highest recorded. Mean demand for P5-P12 is 68.9 (+115% vs initial historical baseline).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Fitted strappy tank top', which is currently entering its peak summer demand season (mid-May). Demand has accelerated significantly, with recent periods (P11-P13) showing 78, 126, and 100 units respectively (mean of 101.3). The 'Anita Tank' is highly seasonal, and as temperatures rise, we must reflect May/June levels rather than the early spring average. Period 13 concluded with a stockout (demand 100 vs 95 arrived), and the current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to focus on this high-summer acceleration (101.3 * (1+4) = 506.5). I am also using recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen during this peak (std dev ~24). This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that prioritizes high service levels for this profitable ($19 profit vs $1 holding) and currently high-velocity item.

Carry-over insight: Peak summer demand regime confirmed: May demand (Periods 11-13) averaged 101.3 units, representing a 50% increase over the early spring average of ~65 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1520.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a jersey tank top, currently in peak summer demand (May/June). Demand is accelerating significantly: Period 14 recorded a high of 152 units, and the last three periods (P12-14) have averaged 126 units. This is a massive jump from the early Spring average (~65) and even the early May average (~101). Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in periods 12, 13, and 14, indicating that current order levels are insufficient for the seasonal surge. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the most recent peak demand level (126, 100, 152). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data. Setting sigma_hat to explicit based on the volatility of the peak regime (std dev \u2248 26 over last 3 periods) ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance during the summer rush.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand accelerated further in mid-May (P14: 152 units). Average demand for mid-May (P12-P14) is 126 units, a ~25% increase over the early May average (101.3). Stockouts occurred in P12, P13, and P14, indicating base stocks need to adjust faster to this seasonal peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226004 (Anita Tank) is in its peak summer season (late May). Recent demand patterns (P12-P15) show a significant surge with values of 126, 100, 152, and 118, averaging 124 units per period. This is nearly four times the initial baseline. The system has suffered from chronic stockouts (P12-P15 ending OH=0) because orders placed in earlier, lower-demand periods (P8-P11) are insufficient for current peak demand. The current inventory (On-hand: 0, In-transit: 495) must cover the next 5 periods (L+1) due to the confirmed stable lead time of 4 periods. Since we have been stocking out, our 'sold' data is censored; actual demand is likely even higher than the recorded mean of 124. I will increase mu_hat to explicitly reflect this summer peak (125 units/period x 5 periods = 625) and increase sigma_hat to account for high volatility (std dev of recent peak ~22, approx 50 over 5 periods). This will force the OR backend to place larger orders to catch up with the summer demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (mid-to-late May) confirmed: Average demand P12-P15 is 124 units (+180% vs early spring). Sustained stockouts since P12 indicate demand is exceeding previous base stock calculations.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a jersey tank top, currently entering its peak summer demand regime in June. Historical demand analysis shows a significant and sustained increase: early Spring (March) averaged ~54 units, May (P13-P15) averaged ~123 units, and the most recent period (P16) recorded 132 units. Since P12, the system has consistently stocked out, indicating that demand is outstripping the current base stock calculations. In P16, we saw an arrival of 90 units (from P12), but it was immediately sold out against 132 demand. The pipeline (567 units) is substantial, but arrivals are lagging behind real-time demand growth. To ensure we capture this peak summer volume and stop the stockout trend, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 650 (target mean ~130 * (L+1)) and sigma_hat to 125 (approx 25 * sqrt(5)) to account for high volatility and maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost. A lead time of 4 periods remains consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime confirmed (June): Demand is consistently exceeding 120 units per period (P14-P16 mean: 134). Service levels have dropped as base stock lags demand acceleration; aggressive inventory positioning is required for the June-July peak.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a jersey tank top, which is currently in its peak summer season (June 10th). Historical records show a sustained demand regime shift starting in mid-May. The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P12-P17) is approximately 120 units (126, 100, 152, 118, 132, 92), significantly higher than the spring average. Period 17 showed a slight dip to 92, but given the product type and date, this is likely a minor fluctuation within a high-demand regime rather than a trend reversal. Stockouts occurred in 5 of the last 6 periods, indicating that we are still catching up with the seasonal peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the recent 6 periods (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this summer peak while accounting for the recent high volatility (std dev ~22). This will provide an aggressive inventory position to prevent further stockouts during the June-July peak.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are in the peak summer demand regime for this jersey tank top. Looking at the last five periods (P14-P18), demand has been 152, 118, 132, 92, and 94 (mean = 117.6). While demand softened slightly in the last two weeks (92, 94), it remains significantly elevated compared to the spring average (~65) and initial historical data. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P14 order arrived in P18). Current on-hand is 50, with a large pipeline of 553 units. The stockouts observed from P12-P16 have been mitigated by the arrival of the large P14 order (141 units). However, the OR backend's inventory position calculation (On-hand + Pipeline) is high (603 units), which might trigger a zero order if parameters are not set aggressively enough to cover the lead time (4) + review period (1) = 5 periods of peak demand. To maintain a safe buffer for the remainder of June/July, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (June) confirmed: Average demand P14-P18 is 117.6 units, showing sustained high volume compared to pre-summer levels.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a jersey tank top (summer seasonal item) on June 24th, 2019. We are in the summer peak demand regime. Demand remains high and volatile; Period 19 demand was 152 units, matching the previous high (P14). The mean demand for the most recent 6 periods (P14-P19) is 123.3 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 67, and we have a substantial pipeline in-transit (463 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the backend will naturally target a high service level. To ensure the backend captures the recent summer acceleration, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the mean demand of ~123. This ensures the base stock (calculated for L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 615 + safety stock, which aligns with covering the summer peak before demand begins its late-summer decline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, entering the peak summer season for this fitted tank top. Historical demand in June (Periods 17-20) has been consistently strong, averaging 117.5 units per period. The recent observation from P20 (132 units) maintains the high-demand regime identified in previous periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to maintain a high service level by basing parameters on this sustained summer peak. I will use recent_N=5 (Periods 16-20) to capture the most recent high-volume demand trend for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock calculation, which covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), is sufficient to meet the expected July volume without excessive overstocking as we move deeper into the season.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, reflecting the middle of the summer peak for this jersey tank top. Historical demand for the last five periods (P17-P21) has been 92, 94, 152, 132, 99, resulting in a mean of 113.8 units per period, which aligns with the previously identified 'Summer peak demand regime' (mean ~117 units). Although demand fluctuated in the last three periods, the overall trend remains significantly higher than the spring average. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (P21 saw the arrival of the P17 order). I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the full volatility of the current June/July summer regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=5 covers the most recent sustained high-demand period while being sensitive to the slight volume dip observed in the most recent week. L will be set to the promised lead time of 4.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are analyzing SKU 692226004, a jersey tank top. Historical demand data shows a significant seasonal peak that began in mid-May and continued through June, with demand often exceeding 100 units. However, recent demand (Periods 21 and 22: 99 and 79 units respectively) suggests the peak may be starting to taper off as we move further into July. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. In Period 22, the arrival was '0', but this is consistent with the order placed in Period 18 being '0'. The actual lead time is still inferred as 4. Our current on-hand inventory is 141, and we have a significant pipeline of 448 units (orders from P19, P20, P21, and P22). To avoid overstocking as the summer peak potentially wanes, I will use a recent demand window of 5 periods (P18-P22) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the high June demand with the more recent July moderation. The N=5 mean is 111.2, which is higher than the very latest sample but lower than the June peak, providing a safe transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially tapering from summer peak: July demand (P21-P22) averaged 89 units, compared to the June (P17-P20) average of 117.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1100.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 21-23: 99, 79, 66) confirms a tapering from the summer peak (June average ~117.5). The average unit demand for the last 3 periods is ~81.3, down from values exceeding 120 in early summer. The carry-over insight from P23 already flagged this downward trend. On-hand inventory is healthy at 154, and there is a significant pipeline (447 units). Specifically, looking at the history, the order from Period 18 (0 units) was followed by a large order in Period 20 (168 units) which is expected to arrive in Period 24 (current), and the Period 21 order (133 units) is expected in Period 25. Therefore, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current decline in seasonal demand faster than a full history mean would, while maintaining lead time at the stable observed 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect this lower regime (approx 80-90 per period) helps prevent over-ordering as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed: Late July demand (P21-P23) averaged 81.3 units, a 30% decrease from the June peak mean of 117.5 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late July (2019/7/29). Demand for this Anita Tank (a jersey basic/fitted strappy top) is naturally tapering off as the peak summer season concludes. Historical data confirms this shift: June demand (P17-P20) averaged ~117.5 units, whereas July demand (P21-P24) has dropped significantly, with the last four periods averaging 76 units (99, 79, 66, 60). The most recent three periods (P22-P24) averaged 68 units. We currently have a healthy on-hand inventory of 262 units and 279 in-transit. An order placed in Period 18 (lead_time 4) is missing in the 'conclude' messages (expected in P22), while P19 and P20 orders arrived correctly. Period 18 was an order of 0 units, so there's nothing to arrive from that period anyway. Using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) captures the current July tapering regime (mean ~76). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with recent_N=4 will prevent over-ordering as we move toward the end of the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed for late summer: July demand (P21-P24) averaged 76 units, a 35% decrease from the June average of 117.5 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The customer is currently at Period 26 (August 5). The product, a jersey tank top, is entering the late summer/early autumn phase. Analysis of recent demand (P21-P25: 99, 79, 66, 60, 50) confirms a significant downward trend as the peak summer season (June-July) ends. The mean demand of the last 5 periods is 70.8, but the most recent 3 periods (P23-P25) average 58.6, showing a clear deceleration. On-hand inventory is high at 345 units with an additional 146 units in-transit (P22 order of 68 and P23 order of 78). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. Given the cooling demand and high current inventory levels (on-hand covers ~6 periods of current demand), the focus shifts to minimize holding costs while the backend OR policy naturally limits further ordering. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward shift without over-reacting to a single lowest point, ensuring the OR backend targets a lower base stock.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand decline confirmed: August demand (starting P21) shows a consistent downward trend (99, 79, 66, 60, 50). Mean demand for P23-P25 is 58.6, a ~50% reduction from the June peak of ~118 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Anita Tank (a jersey basic) is in a clear seasonal decline as we move into mid-August. The most recent demand samples (P23-P26: 66, 60, 50, 43) show a consistent downward trend from the June peak. The mean demand for the last 4 periods is 54.75 units. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 370 units, with 78 units in-transit (ordered P23, expected next period). Total inventory and pipeline (448 units) is significantly higher than the projected demand over the next 5 periods (~275 units based on current mean). To avoid excessive holding costs during this post-peak period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 4-period window to capture the downward trend. No new orders should be triggered by the OR backend given the high current inventory level.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand decline continues: mean demand (P23-P26) is 54.8 units, a 53% decrease from the June peak (117.5). Inventory levels are currently high (370 units) relative to this lower demand regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Anita Tank (Jersey Basic) is clearly in a late-summer decline phase. Recent demand samples starting from Period 21 are: 99, 79, 66, 60, 50, 43, 44. This shows a stabilized lower regime around 40-50 units per period. The mean of the most recent 5 periods (P23-P27) is 48.2 units, a significant drop from the June peak of ~118 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 404 units with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a current demand rate of ~45 units, the current stock covers approximately 9 periods of demand (404 / 45 \u2248 8.9). Since $L=4$, we are targeting coverage for $L+1=5$ periods. My current inventory (404) is significantly higher than the required base stock (approx 5 * 45 = 225). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this lower regime, and L=calculate to maintain the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand stabilized at a lower regime: P23-P27 mean demand is 48.2 units, representing a ~60% decrease from the summer peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Anita Tank (Jersey Basic/fitted tank) has consistently declined since the summer peak in June. We are now in late August (Period 29), and the demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower level. Recent demand samples (P24-P28) are 60, 50, 43, 44, and 39, resulting in a mean of 47.2. Current on-hand inventory is 365 units with zero in-transit, which covers more than 7 periods of current demand (365 / 47.2 \u2248 7.7). Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked. No orders have been placed in the last 5 periods (P24-P28), and none should be placed now. I will set the parameters to reflect the lower recent demand (N=6, covering P23-P28) and use the calculate method for lead time as it has remained stable at 4 periods throughout the game (with the exception of one potentially lost or missing order from Period 18).

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand regime stabilized (P24-P28): mean demand is 47.2 units, a ~60% reduction from the June peak (117.5). High inventory (365 units) persists relative to this lower demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Historical data and recent demand trends (Periods 24-29: 60, 50, 43, 44, 39, 24) confirm a significant tapering of the summer peak for this jersey tank top, with the most recent demand hitting a low of 24 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (N=5) is 34.8 units. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 341 units, with no units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5), the total demand coverage target at 34.8 units/period would be approximately 174 units. Since on-hand inventory (341) far exceeds the required coverage (174) and lead time is stable at 4 periods, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect this lower, late-season demand regime, allowing the system to naturally bleed off excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed: Period 25-29 average demand is 40.0 units, a nearly 70% decrease from the June peak. Inventory surplus exists; base stock should reflect the lower seasonal demand of ~35-40 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Anita Tank has entered a clear post-summer decline. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 33.6 units, a sharp contrast to the June peak of ~118 units. The most recent demand (Period 30) was only 18 units. We are currently in a high inventory state (323 units on-hand) with zero pipeline inventory. With lead time stable at 4 periods, we need to adjust the base stock to cover the lower seasonal demand. Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat captures this new regime, while recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat provides a stable volatility estimate following the high-variance summer peak. This conservative approach will prevent further over-ordering while we burn through existing excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift confirmed: September demand has dropped to an average of ~33 units (P26-P30), representing a 70%+ decrease from the June peak. Current on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover several lead-time cycles at this rate.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 692226004 (tank top) has entered a clear post-summer decline. In the last five periods (P27-P31), demand has consistently dropped (44, 39, 24, 18, 6), with the most recent sample being very low. This aligns with the seasonal transition out of summer. Current on-hand inventory is 317 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate of ~26 units/period (average of P27-P31). With a 4-period lead time, we have enough stock to satisfy demand for over 10 periods without ordering. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the downward trend, which will likely result in zero orders until the inventory levels normalize relative to the new demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline is accelerating in September: Period 31 demand dropped to 6 units. Average demand for the first two weeks of September (P30-P31) is 12 units, significantly lower than the August average of ~40 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226004 (Fitted strappy tank top) has exited its peak summer demand regime and is now in a significant post-summer decline. The most recent demand samples (P30: 18, P31: 6, P32: 15) indicate a mean demand of approximately 13 units per week, which is a sharp drop even from the August average of ~40 units. Current on-hand inventory is 302 units with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current rate of ~13 units/period, required stock is approximately 65-80 units. With 302 units on hand, we are significantly overstocked for the current demand regime. No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this latest seasonal drop in September, while keeping sigma_hat at 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the late-summer volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (4 weeks).

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift confirmed: Demand has dropped significantly to an average of ~13 units (P30-P32), down from ~40 in August and ~117 in June peak. Inventory is currently in a surplus state (300+ units on hand).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226004 (Anita Tank) has completed its summer seasonal peak and is now in a low-demand autumn regime. Recent demand reflects this: P30-P33 levels are 18, 6, 15, and 21 respectively, yielding a Mean of 15.0 and a SD of 6.4. The current on-hand inventory of 281 units is extremely high, representing approximately 18 periods of cover at current sales rates. With a lead time of 4 periods, no further orders are required. The OR backend needs to recognize this lower demand regime to avoid placing unnecessary 'top-up' orders. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to accurately model this post-summer floor and prevent further accumulation of holding costs.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift (P30-P33): Demand has stabilized at a low floor (avg 15.0 units), a 90% decrease from June peak. Massive overstock exists (281 units vs ~75 required for L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-61.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic Fitted strappy top', which shows strong seasonal behavior. We are now in October (P35), and demand has dropped significantly from the June peak (~117 units) to a post-summer low. Recent demand (P31-P34) has been 6, 15, 21, and 11, averaging approximately 13.25 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 270 units, which, at the current demand rate of ~14 units, covers roughly 19 periods (nearly 5 months). Since the lead time is 4 periods and the review period is 1, we only need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, approximately 70-80 units. We have a massive surplus (270 vs. ~75 required). For the OR backend, I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect this new low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. No new orders should be placed until inventory levels fall significantly.

Carry-over insight: October demand remains at a post-summer floor: Period 31-34 average is 13.3 units, a 90% decrease from the summer peak. Existing inventory of 270 units is excessive for current demand levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226004 (Anita Tank) has entered a stable low-demand regime following its summer peak. In October, demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the last five periods (P31-P35) recording demands of 6, 15, 21, 11, and 9 units (mean = 12.4). The current on-hand inventory is 261 units, while the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 62 units (at the current mean). Therefore, the system is in a significant overstock position. To minimize holding costs while the inventory naturally depletes, I will continue to set parameters that represent this low-demand floor. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current 12.4 unit/period demand level, which will result in a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand, correctly resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: October demand remains stable at a post-summer floor: P31-P35 average is 12.4 units, representing a >85% decrease from the early spring average and a >90% decrease from the summer peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 21st, and the product (a jersey tank top) has transitioned into a very low-demand post-summer regime. Demand over the last five periods (P32-P36) has been 15, 21, 11, 9, and 8 units respectively, averaging 12.8 units per period. This represents a significant drop from the summer peak (>100 units) and even the early spring levels. On-hand inventory is currently 253 units with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the current review period, the inventory requirement for a 95% service level is approximately (L+1) * mu_hat + z * sigma_hat * sqrt(L+1). With an expected demand of ~13 units/period, the target base stock is roughly 75-90 units. Since current on-hand inventory (253) is nearly 3x the required level, no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect this stabilized low-demand regime (recent_N=5) to prevent the OR backend from triggering orders based on the much higher historical summer data.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Anita Tank (a jersey tank top) has significantly declined as we enter late October. Recent demand (P30-P37) has averaged 13.75 units per period, a stark contrast to the June peak of ~118 units. With on-hand inventory currently at 231 units, the stock is sufficient to cover approximately 17 lead-time cycles (L=4) at the current demand rate. There are no units in transit. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. a profit of $19.0, it is crucial to avoid further inventory accumulation while this late-season demand floor persists. I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 10 periods to reflect this low-demand regime and keep orders at zero until on-hand inventory reasonably approaches the base stock requirement (which is ~70-80 units).

Carry-over insight: Late October demand floor confirmed: Average demand for P33-P37 is 14.2 units, indicating a stable but very low post-summer volume.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a tank top, which has transitioned from a summer peak (approx. 117 units/period) to a stable late-autumn low-demand regime. Current demand (Periods 33-38) has stabilized at a mean of 13.8 units per period. On-hand inventory is currently 219 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, a base stock to cover demand over (L+1) = 5 periods would be approximately 70-80 units. Since current on-hand inventory (219) is nearly triple the required base stock, no new orders are necessary. I will maintain a mu_hat based on the most recent 6 periods to reflect this low-volume regime and rely on the OR backend's inventory balancing to continue 'ordering' zero units until the surplus is cleared. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Anita Tank (Jersey Basic) has remained at a stable post-summer floor throughout October and into November. The average demand for the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39) is approximately 13.9 units, with recent fluctuations between 7 and 22 units. We are currently in a massive overstock position with 212 units on hand, which at the current consumption rate, covers over 15 periods of demand (well beyond the L+1 cycle of 5 periods). Therefore, I will continue to set ordering parameters to zero by using a calculation that yields a base stock level lower than the current inventory. I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering during this seasonal trough.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand floor remains extremely stable through October and early November (P30-P39), with a mean of 13.9 units. Massive inventory surplus persists.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Fitted strappy top', a summer-seasonal item. Historically, demand peaked in June (avg ~117) and has since collapsed. We are currently in mid-November (Period 41), well into the off-season. Demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) has averaged 10.6 units (range 6-22). With 205 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, the inventory covers nearly 20 periods (at current demand rates), whereas the L+1 cycle (5 periods) only requires approximately 53-75 units total to maintain a high service level. The OR backend needs to recognize this lower demand regime to avoid placing unnecessary orders while the holding cost ( $1/unit/period) continues to erode profit. I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture the stable post-summer floor and setting L to calculate to confirm the lead time remains 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand floor has sustained into mid-November: Average demand (P31-P40) is 10.6 units, a >90% reduction from the summer peak. Significant inventory surplus (205 units) remains.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'tank top', a highly seasonal summer item. Demand has reached its seasonal floor in late November, consistent with the product category. In Period 41, demand was 10 units. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), the mean demand is 11.6 units, or approximately 58 units for the (L+1) horizon. Currently, on-hand inventory is 195 units with 0 in-transit, which covers more than 16 weeks of demand at the current rate. Since the game ends at Period 47 (6 periods left), and current inventory massively exceeds total expected demand until the end of the simulation, no new orders should be placed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the stable post-summer floor for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L, ensuring the backend base stock remains far below the existing inventory level to prevent unnecessary ordering and minimize holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this jersey tank top has settled into a very low post-summer/winter floor. Since Period 31 (Mid-September), demand has consistently stayed below 25 units per period, with a recent mean (P38-P42) of approximately 10.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 179 units with zero in-transit, which covers more than 17 periods of current demand\u2014far exceeding the requirements for a 4-period lead time. To minimize holding costs while the system works through this massive surplus, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period regime (N=10) to reflect the low winter demand. No new orders will be triggered by the OR backend until the on-hand inventory drops significantly below the base stock level (which is approximately (1+L)*10 = 50 units). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand floor has extended into December: Average demand for the last 10 periods (P33-P42) is 12.1 units, confirming a stable low-season regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a jersey tank top, which is currently in its off-season (December). Demand has consistently been in a post-summer floor regime since Period 30 (September). For the most recent 10 periods (P34-P43), demand has averaged 10.1 units with very low volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 176 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining 4 periods of the game (total expected demand < 60 units), especially considering the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to the low demand. There are no units in transit and no new orders are necessary. I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent stable low-demand window (N=10) to minimize the base stock level and prevent any further automated ordering, allowing the excess inventory to be sold off.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for this Anita Tank top has stabilized at an extremely low seasonal floor, consistent with winter. The last five periods (P40-P44) show demand values of 10, 16, 3, AND 4, averaging 8.25 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 172 units with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate, this inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 20 periods, whereas the lead time is only 4. Since the game ends at Period 47, no further orders should be placed to avoid unnecessary holding costs, as current stock far exceeds any potential demand for the final two periods. I am setting L to 4 as observed, mu_hat to a low recent average (N=10) to reflect the winter floor, and sigma_hat similarly to minimize the base stock calculation, ensuring the OR backend correctly identifies the surplus and places no new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-52.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 46 (Late December). The SKU is a 'tank top', a seasonal item that peaked in June/July (Period 17-20) with demand over 100 units. Demand has since plummeted to a 'winter floor' regime. For the last 5 periods (P41-P45), demand has been 10, 16, 3, 4, 6 respectively (Mean=7.8). Despite the huge surplus (166 units on hand), the goal is to maintain parameters that reflect the current low-demand reality. I am using recent_N=5 to capture this extremely low winter demand (mean ~7.8) to prevent any inadvertent ordering from the backend while on-hand inventory is drawn down. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed (P41-P45): Mean demand has dropped further to 7.8 units, reflecting minimum seasonality for this jersey tank top.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-46.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226004 (jersey tank top) is in its winter low-season demand regime. Current observations from Period 41 to Period 46 show a mean demand of approximately 7.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 160 units, which, even at the historical spring mean (approx. 32-50 units), is more than enough to cover the lead time (L=4). Given the current low demand floor (L+1 demand \u2248 40 units), there is a significant inventory surplus. I will maintain the 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent winter floor (P41-P46) and ensure the OR backend triggers no new orders while inventory remains high over the next several periods.
