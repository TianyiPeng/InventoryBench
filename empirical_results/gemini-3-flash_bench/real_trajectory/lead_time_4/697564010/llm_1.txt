  "rationale": "Product 697564010 is a 'KELLY SHIRT' from the Divided Collection (H&M line), described as an airy cotton blouse. The current date is 2019/02/11, which marks the transition from late winter to early spring in the fashion retail calendar. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend leading into February (0, 2, 10, 16, 24), suggesting the start of a spring seasonal ramp-up. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I must order enough to cover the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Estimating demand: the most recent observation was 24. With a growing trend, I forecast demand for the next 5 periods as approximately 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, totaling 200 units. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred to avoid stockouts during this growth phase. I will place an initial order of 200 units to build the pipeline.",

Historical demand shows a sharp upward trend: 0 (Jan 7) -> 2 -> 10 -> 16 -> 24 (Feb 4), and the most recent demand in Period 1 (Feb 11) was 20. This suggests a current demand regime of approximately 20-25 units per week, which is likely to increase as temperatures rise in the Northern Hemisphere. Lead time is promised at 4 periods. With a lead time of 4, I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (L+1 = 5 periods). Estimated demand for these 5 periods: 25 (P2) + 25 (P3) + 30 (P4) + 35 (P5) + 40 (P6) = 155 units. Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 200 in-transit (ordered P1, expected P5). Since the current in-transit (200) already covers the estimated demand through the lead time window (155), and arriving too many units early would incur high holding costs ($1/unit), I will not place an additional order this period. I will wait to see if the lead time of 4 is confirmed.",

No arrivals yet, which is consistent with L=4. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 400. We have lost significant sales due to 0 inventory (sold=0 for P1-P3). (e) Order logic: We need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Forecasting demand at avg ~100-120/week for the next 5 weeks suggests a total need of ~600 units. Current pipeline is 400.

Note: I skipped ordering in P2. Estimated future demand: Period 4 was 144. Given the explosive growth (doubling recently), I forecast demand for Periods 5-9 (the L+1 window) to average at least 150-200 units per week.

  "rationale": "The SKU (Kelly Shirt in airy cotton) is a highly seasonal garment that peaked in May/June and has been in a terminal low-demand regime since October. Current demand is negligible, averaging ~6 units per period over the last 10 periods, with the most recent periods (P44-P45) showing only 2-3 units. On-hand inventory stands at 501 units, which is enough to cover current demand levels for over 80 periods. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 46 of 47) and there is a massive inventory surplus, the priority is to minimize holding costs and avoid any further ordering. No additional inventory is needed.",

  "rationale": "The product is a 'KELLY SHIRT', an airy cotton blouse, which is highly seasonal. We are now in Period 47 (Dec 30, 2019), which is the final period of the game dataset. Demand has collapsed from its spring/summer peak (>200 units) to a terminal low-season regime of 1-3 units per period in December. The current on-hand inventory is 500 units, which is extremely high given that the product is completely out of season and we have reached the conclusion of the timeline. Since the holding cost is $1.0/unit and the expected demand is negligible, any further order would only increase holding costs without any possibility of sale before the game ends. Therefore, the order quantity is 0.",
