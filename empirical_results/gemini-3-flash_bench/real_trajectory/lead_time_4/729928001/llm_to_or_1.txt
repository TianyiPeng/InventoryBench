Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is a 'Short skater skirt', which typically sees increasing demand leading into the spring/summer season (February/March). Historical demand shows a steady upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 71, 79, 82, 90, 80 (avg ~80). Currently, on-hand inventory and in-transit units are 0. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no lead time history yet, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat, because of the slightly increasing trend and seasonal entry into spring, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent mean (~80.4 per week). Based on the OR logic (1+L)*mean, this translates to a base stock targeting ~402 units (80.4 * 5). The sigma_hat will also use the recent 5 samples to capture the relevant volatility during this transition period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a short skater skirt (729928001), part of the 'Divided Collection', which often caters to early spring/summer trends for younger demographics. Historically, demand in Jan/Feb was between 71-90, and Period 1 demand spiked to 97. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 92 units based on a previous policy, which are now in-transit. On-hand remains 0, and we lost all 97 potential sales in Period 1 due to stockout. Since the promised lead time L=4, we expect that the Period 1 order will arrive in Period 5. For the current order, we need to cover demand for Period 2 through Period 6 (L+1 periods). Given the slight upward trend (71 -> 97), I will use the recent five samples (82, 90, 80, 79, 71 were the provided seed samples, but I'll focus on the most recent 5 including the P1 97 demand) to estimate mu_hat. N=5 covers late Jan to mid Feb. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 samples to capture the recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a 'Short skater skirt', which typically sees a demand increase as spring approaches. Historical demand samples (Early Jan to Early Feb) averaged 80.4 units. However, observed demand in Period 1 (97) and Period 2 (171) shows a significant upward trend, likely driven by seasonal transition into spring. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 191 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Promised lead time is 4. Since L=4, the P1 order (92 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in P6). To capture the recent demand surge while maintaining stability, I will use recent_N (N=2) for demand mean (mu_hat) to weigh the latest spikes of 97 and 171 (avg 134) against the historical base, and recent_N for sigma to account for the increased volatility. Lead time L is set to default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Period 1: demand increased from an average of 80 (Jan/Feb) to 134 (last 2 periods), a 67% increase, signaling spring seasonality for the 'skater skirt' category.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). The SKU is a 'short skater skirt', which typically sees rising demand in the spring. Period 1-3 demand (97, 171, 105) averages 124, significantly higher than the Jan/Feb pre-game average of 80. Specifically, Period 2 saw a spike of 171. On-hand remains 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods; orders from Period 1 (92 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5 conclude (visible Period 6). Currently, 387 units are in-transit (P1: 92, P2: 99, P3: 196). Since no orders have arrived yet, L is set to 'default' (4 periods). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher in-game demand average (~124), resulting in a 5-period base stock (L+1) that accounts for the spring shift. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to focus on the volatility observed during this recent transition.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'short skater skirt', which often sees a spring surge. Following the initial Jan/Feb demand (avg ~80), Period 2 showed a huge spike (171), which settled to 105 and 73 in Periods 3 and 4. The average demand across these 4 periods is 111.5. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 579 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time (L=4), the first order (Period 1) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5. We should see confirmation of this arrival in the Period 6 start message. Because we have not yet observed any 'conclude' messages showing arrivals, we maintain the default L=4. For demand (mu_hat), the recent surge followed by a slight cooling suggests a 'recent_N' approach is best to capture the transition from winter to spring; using N=4 covers all periods of the game history. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the high volatility (73 to 171) seen during this transition.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Short skater skirt', which typically sees a seasonal demand increase in spring. Historically, demand jumped from ~80 (Jan/Feb) to an average of 103 over the last 5 periods (97, 171, 105, 73, 72). While the initial spike in Period 1-2 was very high, it has stabilized. We have confirmed the lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Currently, we have 20 units on hand and 620 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Since the pipeline is very full (620 units) relative to recent demand (avg ~100/week), the OR backend's capped policy will likely limit new ordering. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the post-surge stabilized mean (~103.6 per period), and L to the confirmed promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 5). Post-seasonal-surge demand (P1-P5) stabilized at an average of 104 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6. The 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' experienced an initial spring surge in P1-P3 (avg 124), but demand has since tapered off to a lower baseline in P4-P6 (avg 70.6). Given the SKU is a 'Short skater skirt' in the 'Divided Collection', demand should remain relatively stable as we enter early spring, though the extreme peak from Feb has passed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current post-peak demand level (P3-P6 average: 79.25), which balances the high P3 demand with the more recent lower values. On-hand is 52, and 548 units are in transit (orders from P3-P6). With a lead time of 4, our 'pipeline' must cover 5 periods of demand (Period 7-11). At ~80/period, requirement is ~400. Since pipeline visibility (548) plus on-hand (52) equals 600, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a small or zero order this period to avoid overstocking while holding costs are $1.0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: After a spring peak in Feb (P1-P3 avg 124), demand has stabilized at a lower level for March (P4-P6 avg 71).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 1st. The product is a short skater skirt. Historical performance shows a spring peak in February (Periods 1-3, avg demand ~124) followed by a stabilization in March (Periods 4-7, avg demand ~71). As we enter April, I expect demand to remain stable or slightly decrease as the initial spring shopping surge concludes. Inventory is currently healthy with 177 units on hand and 352 units in transit (expected arrivals of 192 from P4 in P8, and 133 from P5 in P9). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the stable demand platform of ~71 observed over the last four periods (P4-P7), I will use a recent_N calculation for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current post-peak regime and avoid over-ordering based on the high February demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT'. Current inventory is high (On-hand: 230, In-transit: 160) following large arrivals from early spring orders. Demand has been volatile: P4-P7 averaged 71, but Period 8 saw a sharp spike to 139. Historically, early April can see volatility as spring weather stabilizes or pre-Easter shopping begins. However, the last 5 periods (P4-P8) average 92.8 units. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and on-hand inventory totaling 390 units, and the backend's base-stock logic, I will use recent_N to capture the recent mean (92.8) and volatility. This helps prevent over-ordering while reflecting the recent demand increase from 71 to 139. N=5 covers the shift from early March to the start of April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we observe a stabilized demand regime following a late February/early March peak. The last 6 periods (P4-P9) show an average demand of 81 units, though Period 8 showed an outlier spike of 139. Given the product is a 'Short skater skirt', April often transitions into a steadier spring demand before any potential early summer peaks. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (299 units) and 162 units are in transit (27 from P6 and 135 from P9). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 6 periods (N=6), which captures the post-peak level. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to capture the volatility seen in Period 8.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed post-peak: Period 4-9 average demand is 81 units/period, down from the February average of 124 units/period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (April 22), the 'Jessy Jersey Skirt' has entered a stable demand regime after the initial February/spring peak. Over the last 7 periods (P4-P10), demand has averaged 80.4 units/period, despite a single outlier spike in P8 (139 units). The current on-hand inventory is 254 units, and with the lead time confirmed at 4 periods, we also have 185 units in-transit (orders from P9 and P10). Total pipeline inventory is 439 units. Given the desired service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) and the holding cost of $1/unit, our goal is to maintain roughly (L+1) periods of stock. Since (4+1) * 80 = 400, our current inventory position (439) is slightly above the immediate requirement, which is appropriate given the P8 volatility. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this post-peak stabilization period (P4-P10) while excluding the early-year surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (L=4).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (late April), the 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' demand is relatively stable but has shown some volatility. In Period 11, the order from Period 7 (for 0 units) resulted in no arrival, which is consistent with the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 174 units, with 242 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 9, 10, and 11). Demand from Period 4 to Period 11 has averaged approximately 80 units per period (638/8), though Period 8 saw an unexplained spike to 139. Given we are approaching May, demand might remain steady or slightly increase before the summer peak. I will use recent_N with N=8 (the stable post-February period) for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this 'normal' regime including the recent spike. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a 'Short skater skirt', which typically sees peak demand in spring (February/March) followed by stabilization or a secondary summer lift. Historical demand from Period 4 to Period 12 has stabilized at an average of 78 units per period (73, 72, 67, 71, 139, 64, 72, 80, 71), with one outlier in P8. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated through P10). However, no arrivals were recorded in P11 and P12, despite orders placed in P7 and P8. Note that P7 had an order of 0, explaining the zero arrival in P11. P8 had an order of 0, explaining the zero arrival in P12. This confirms the lead time remains 4. We are currently in a stable demand regime post-spring peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the demand since the March shift (P4-P12), which provides a stable mean for the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the next 5 periods (L+1).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is a short skater skirt. We are in a stable demand regime post-spring peak. Analysis of the last 10 periods (P4-P13) shows demand averaging 81.4 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 22 units. Period 8 saw a brief spike (139), but subsequent periods (P9-P13) have remained very stable around 70 units (avg 70.2). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P9 order arrived in P13). There was a gap in arrivals in P11 and P12 because no orders were placed in P7 and P8 (due to high inventory). These gaps are now resolved as the P9 order arrived. The current on-hand (174) plus in-transit (241) equals 415 units. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent stable demand of ~70 units, 5 periods would require ~350 units. The pipeline is currently healthy. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the current stabilization at around 70 units/period, and use a calculation-based lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Following the early April spike (P8), demand from P9 to P13 has stabilized at an average of 70 units/period, down from the overall post-peak average of 81.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a short skater skirt, which typically sees higher demand in early spring and stabilizes or declines as mid-summer approaches. Historical analysis shows a significant surge in February/early April, followed by stabilization. From Period 9 to Period 14 (late April to mid-May), demand has consistently hovered around a mean of 65.5 units (64, 72, 80, 71, 64, 49), which is lower than the previous post-peak average of 81. Period 14 demand dropped to 49, possibly indicating the start of a late-spring seasonal dip. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals for P9 and P10 orders). We have 175 units on hand and 209 in transit, which is quite high relative to current demand (approx. 5.8 periods of coverage). I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this lower stabilized demand regime and help the OR backend adjust the base stock downward to reduce holding costs while maintaining the target service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: From Period 9 to 14, demand stabilized at a lower average of ~66 units/period compared to the early April average of 81.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/5/27 (Period 16). The product is a jersey skater skirt. Demand has shown a clear downward trend following the spring peak. For the last 7 periods (P9-P15), demand values have been 64, 72, 80, 71, 64, 49, 45, averaging approximately 64 units/period. The most recent two weeks (49 and 45) suggest a deeper decline as we move towards the end of May. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current inventory status: On-hand is 187, and In-transit is 152 (orders from P12 (73), P13 (61), and P14 (18)). Pipeline inventory (339) is very high relative to the current demand regime. To avoid excessive holding costs as demand cools, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the post-peak average demand (approx 64) for mu_hat. This will result in a base stock target that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+4=5). Since current inventory (339) likely exceeds (5 * 64) + safety stock, the OR engine will likely order zero or the minimum required, which is appropriate given the surplus and declining trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward: Demand from P14-P15 (avg 47) shows a further decline compared to the P9-P13 average (70), indicating the end of the spring/early summer cycle for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1440.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' is transitioning out of its primary spring season. Historical demand shows a downward trend: April (P8-P11) averaged ~89 units/period, May (P12-P15) averaged ~57 units/period, but Period 16 saw a localized spike to 85. Despite that spike, the overall trend is cooling. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 175 and in-transit at 105 (total inventory 280), we are well-covered for the standard lead time of 4 periods plus the review period (5 total periods), assuming a mean demand of ~56 units (280/5). To avoid overstocking in a declining season while acknowledging the unexpected P16 spike, I will use a recent_N calculation for mu_hat with N=4 (Periods 13-16) to capture the most recent volatility and volume shift (avg ~61/period). This provides a balanced base stock for the OR engine while the high current inventory naturally caps further large orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing in late spring: Period 16 saw an unexpected spike to 85 units after a four-period decline (P12-P15 avg 57), suggesting lingering seasonal interest or promotional impact.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 10, 2019 (Period 18). The product is a 'Short skater skirt', which typically sees peak demand in early spring (February-April) and stabilizes/declines toward mid-summer. Recent demand history shows stabilizing numbers: Period 14 (49), Period 15 (45), Period 16 (85 - a spike), and Period 17 (73). The average of the last 4 periods (P14-P17) is 63 units, which is a better reflection of the current late-spring demand than the long-term history. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by the P13 order arriving in P17). Current inventory position: On-hand (163) + In-transit (135: orders from P14, P16, P17; Note: P15 was a zero order) = 298. Given the Promised Lead Time (L=4), we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent average of 63, mu_hat should be approximately 315. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current demand regime (averaging approx 63 units/period) while ignoring the earlier high-season spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for late spring/early summer: Period 14-17 average is 63 units/period, significantly lower than the February peak (124) and April average (81).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17, moving into mid-summer. The product is a short jersey skater skirt, which typically sees peak demand in spring/early summer. Demand in the most recent periods (P16-P18) has been 85, 73, and 81, respectively (avg ~80), which is higher than the previous month's average (~63) but below the spring peak (~124). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 100, with 205 units in-transit (orders from P15-P18). To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, I will use a recent demand window of the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this recent plateau of ~80 units/period, while setting L to 4 to cover the confirmed lead time plus the decision period (L+1=5). This ensures the base stock aligns with the current stabilized demand level before any potential late-summer decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau observed: From Period 16 to 18, demand has stabilized at an average of 80 units/period, an increase from the late-May average of 63, reflecting late-spring/early-summer consistency.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a short jersey skater skirt, which typically sees sustained demand during the summer months. Historical demand analysis shows a recent upward trend (P17: 73, P18: 81, P19: 99), averaging 84.3 units over the last 3 periods. This indicates a late-summer shift compared to the previous plateau of ~80 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated through P18's arrival of the P14 order). Current on-hand inventory is critically low (1 unit). Although there are 295 units in transit, the order from Period 15 (which would have arrived this period) was 0 units, and the next expected arrival (from P16 order) is only 26 units. This creates a risk of a stockout if demand remains high. I will set L to 4 (promised/observed). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the recent demand acceleration (average ~84), which calculates to (1+4)*84 = 420. For sigma_hat, N=4 will also be used to reflect the increasing volatility seen in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-June demand surge: Average demand from Period 17-19 increased to 84 units/period from the previous average of 80, suggesting a mid-summer peak.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. We are experiencing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory due to a significant demand spike in Period 20 (162 units), which exceeded the recent average of ~84 units. The 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' is likely seeing peak mid-summer demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P16 order arrived P20). Orders from P15 (0 units), P17 (91 units), P18 (88 units), and P19 (90 units) are in the pipeline. Note that the P15 order was 0, resulting in no arrival in P19, which contributed to the stockout. I am setting L=4 (promised/calculated). For mu_hat, the recent 3-period average (P18-P20) is 114 units/period, reflecting the current summer surge. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, high-demand summer peak, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the recent variance spike to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Significant mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Period 20 demand peaked at 162 units, bringing the P18-P20 average to 114 units/period, a 35% increase over the late-June average of 84.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. We are in the middle of a significant mid-summer demand surge for the 'Short skater skirt'. Period 21 saw a demand of 111 units, following the massive spike of 162 units in Period 20. Stockouts have occurred in the last two periods (P20 starting OH 27, P21 starting OH 91), leading to significant lost sales. Demand over the last 3 periods (P19-P21) averaged 124 units/period. The pipeline inventory (465 units) reflects larger orders placed recently (P18-P21), but arrivals haven't yet caught up with the July volume. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P17 order arrived P21). I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this high-demand summer regime (approx 124 units per period across 5 periods of lead time/review cycle) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to recover from current stockouts and meet summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: P19-P21 average demand sustained at 124 units/period, causing stockouts in P20-P21. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained mid-summer demand surge (2019/7/15). Period 20 peaked at 162 units, and while Period 22 dropped to 91, the trailing 3-period average (P20-P22) is approximately 121 units/period. The item has been stocking out (ending inventory of 0 for the last three periods) because replenishment arrivals (based on orders from P16-P18) are insufficient to meet this elevated demand. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0, the internal OR engine must generate an order that, combined with the 557 units in-transit (orders from P19-P22), covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime while allowing for the slight cooling seen in the most recent week, ensuring the service level is high enough to end the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge continued: Average demand from Period 20-22 is 121 units/period, compared to the early-June average of 80. Stockouts occurred in P20, P21, and P22 due to this shift.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data from Period 20-23 confirms a significant mid-summer demand surge for the 'Short skater skirt', with demand peaking at 162 in Period 20 and averaging approximately 112 units per period over the last four periods (162, 111, 91, 84). While demand has decreased from the initial spike, it remains elevated compared to the late-spring average of 80. Note that stockouts occurred in Period 20, 21, and 22, meaning true demand might have been even higher than recorded sales. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 23 conclusion for the Period 19 order). To respond to this sustained higher demand regime and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the lead time, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this summer level, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P20-P23) established an average of 112 units/period, significantly higher than the previous 80 units/period plateau, despite a slight downward trend in the newest two samples.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' (a short skater skirt) is in high demand, likely peaking in mid-to-late summer. In Period 24, we saw a demand of 129 units, confirming a return to the higher demand levels seen during the mid-summer surge (P20-P21). The last 5 periods (P20-P24) have an average demand of approximately 115.4 units, which is significantly higher than the spring plateau. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P20 order arriving in P24. Inventory is currently critical (on-hand is 0), and we have experienced frequent stockouts recently. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current summer demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will provide a base stock calculation that accounts for the high demand volatility and volume of the peak summer season while trying to recover from stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P20-P24) average is 115.4 units/period, confirming a sustained peak significantly above the previous 80 units/period plateau. Inventory remains strained with frequent stockouts between P20-P24.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (short skater skirt) is in the middle of its mid-to-late summer season. After a significant demand surge in late June/early July (P20-P21 peaking at 162 units), demand has moderated but remains relatively high. Period 25 saw demand drop to 75 units, but the previous mid-summer regime (P20-P24) averaged 115.4 units/period. The current date (August 5) suggests we are exiting the peak summer window and entering the late summer/early fall transition. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the high summer average while accounting for the recent softening in Period 25. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to capture the higher volatility seen during stockout periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by P21 arriving in P25).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P20-P25) shows average demand of 108.6 units/period, down slightly from the P20-P24 average of 115.4 due to P25's 75 unit demand, signaling a potential late-summer taper.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical data Shows a significant mid-summer demand surge (Period 20-24) where demand averaged ~115 units, but the most recent two periods (P25 and P26) have dropped to 75 and 53 units respectively. This indicates the 'Short skater skirt' is entering a late-summer seasonal taper. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (236) and substantial in-transit stock (375), we need to lower our demand expectation to avoid excessive holding costs as the season ends. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this immediate downward trend (P24-P26 average is ~86 units), which will signal the OR backend to reduce ordering.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand taper confirmed: Demand has dropped for two consecutive weeks (P25: 75, P26: 53) from the mid-summer peak average of 115, signaling the end of the high-demand season for the jersey skirt.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (Jessy Jersey Skirt) is currently ending its mid-summer demand peak. Demand has significantly decelerated over the last three periods (P25: 75, P26: 53, P27: 53) compared to the mid-summer average of ~115 units. This aligns with late August seasonality for a short skater skirt. We currently have 287 units on-hand and 271 units in-transit (total 558 units pipeline). Given the current demand average of 53, this inventory covers approximately 10 weeks, which is excessive given the tapering trend. To avoid high holding costs ($1/unit/period) as we enter the off-season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent downward trend (average ~60 units/period). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand taper confirmed: Demand from P25-P27 (average 60.3 units/period) is approximately 48% lower than the mid-summer peak (P20-P24 average 115.4), ending the seasonal surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $600.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jessy Jersey Skirt' is experiencing a confirmed late-summer demand taper as we enter late August. The mid-summer peak (P20-P24), which averaged 115.4 units/period, has subsided. The last four periods (P25-P28) show a significant drop with demand values of 75, 53, 53, and 50 respectively. The average for the last three periods is approximately 52 units, representing a 55% reduction from the peak. Current on-hand inventory is 350 units, and there are 158 units in-transit. With total inventory (508) and a projected demand of ~52 units/period, we have approximately 9-10 periods of coverage, which is far beyond the (L+1=5) period target. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P24 order arriving in P28. Therefore, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and continue with the calculated lead time to minimize further ordering and allow on-hand inventory to deplete toward safer levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization: Period 26-28 average demand is 52 units/period (P26: 53, P27: 53, P28: 50), confirming a stable low-demand regime following the late-summer taper.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Historical demand analysis confirms that the 'Jessy Jersey Skirt' has exited its mid-summer peak (Period 20-24 average ~115) and transitioned into a stable low-demand post-summer regime. Demand over the last four periods (P26-P29) has averaged 56.5 units/period (53, 53, 50, 70). The slight uptick to 70 in P29 is likely minor noise or a back-to-school blip rather than a new surge. On-hand inventory is currently high (392 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the summer peak. These 392 units alone cover nearly 7 periods of the current average demand (56.5), which is well beyond the (L+1=5) coverage target. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and the clear downward seasonal shift, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the post-summer stabilization while allowing the OR backend to stop ordering and bleed off excess inventory to minimize holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $622.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the post-summer/autumn phase (September). Historical demand analysis shows a transition from a mid-summer peak (avg ~115) to a stable low-demand regime starting around Period 26. For the last five periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 55.8 units/period (53, 53, 50, 70, 53). Current on-hand inventory is 385 units with zero units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Our current stock of 385 units is more than sufficient to cover the projected demand of ~280 units (56 * 5) over that interval. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 5-period regime (N=5) to reflect this lower stabilization. No new orders are expected to be generated by the OR backend as the pipeline (385) exceeds the target base stock, which is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed: Period 26-30 average demand is 55.8 units/period, following the late-summer taper. On-hand inventory is currently high relative to this new regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The 'Jessy Jersey Skirt' has entered a stable post-summer demand regime. Analysis of the last six periods (P26-P31) shows demand has stabilized at an average of 57.7 units per period (53, 53, 50, 70, 53, 67), which is a significant drop from the mid-summer peak of ~115 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is 318 units with 0 units in-transit. With an average weekly demand of ~58 units, the current stock covers over 5 periods of demand (318 / 58 \u2248 5.5). Since the base stock target for a lead time of 4 (covering 5 periods of demand) would be around 290-320 units depending on safety stock, and we already have 318 on hand, the OR engine should naturally hold off on ordering. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to reflect this new lower demand level accurately and ensure the backend does not over-order as we move deeper into autumn.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable post-summer low-demand regime. Average demand since the late-summer taper (Period 26 to Period 32) is approximately 58.7 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 253 units, which covers more than 4 periods of the current average demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by history), suggesting a target cycle of L+1 = 5 periods. With 253 units on-hand and 2 in transit, the current inventory position of 255 is sufficient to cover the expected demand of approximately 293 units over the next 5 periods, especially considering the high service level target (profit/holding cost ratio \u2248 19:1). Because on-hand inventory is still relatively high from previous over-ordering during the summer peak, I will use a recent_N method with N=7 to capture the core of the stabilized post-summer demand (P26-P32) without being influenced by the mid-summer surge. This will allow the inventory to burn down naturally while maintaining a safe buffer.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (Jessy Jersey Skirt) is currently in a post-summer transition phase. Following a stable late-summer period with demand averaging ~56 units (P26-P31), Period 33 unexpectedly saw a significant spike to 120 units on September 23rd. While this could be a one-off outlier or late-season clearance, it is safer to adjust the forecast slightly upward to prevent stockouts while managing the high on-hand inventory (133 units). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P26 order arrived in P30). Pipeline inventory is 71 units (P32 order of 2 and P33 order of 69). Given the recent volatility (67, 65, 120), I will use the average of the last 4 periods (P30-P33) to set mu_hat, which results in a base mean of approximately 76 units per period. The OR backend will compute the order based on this updated demand expectation and current inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 33: demand spiked to 120 units after a stable 5-week plateau of ~56 units/period (P26-P31), potentially signaling a seasonal transition or promotional event.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (Jessy Jersey Skirt) is experiencing a non-trivial autumn demand shift. After a stable post-summer plateau of ~56 units, demand spiked in Period 33 (120 units) and remained elevated in Period 34 (90 units). This suggests a secondary seasonal peak or a successful promotional campaign. The current on-hand inventory (43 units) is low, and the pipeline (197 units) is mostly from very recent large orders (P33, P34), which will take several periods to arrive (L=4). To prevent stockouts during this transition, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new elevated demand regime (avg ~92 units/period, requiring ~460 units for the L+5 window). Sigma_hat is set to the same window to address the increased volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'calculate' as historical arrivals (P1-P26) consistently show a 4-period duration.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn demand shift detected: Period 33-34 average demand is 105 units/period, a significant increase from the previous 5-week plateau of ~56 units/period (P26-P31).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (short skater skirt) is experiencing a significant autumn demand surge. Demand in the last three periods (P33-P35) averaged 97 units/period (120, 90, 81), which is a sharp increase from the previous stable plateau of ~56 units (P26-P31). On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 35, where demand (81) exceeded starting on-hand (43). In-transit inventory is 334 units (ordered P32-P35), but those orders won't arrive until Period 37-40 based on the 4-period lead time. To address this new demand regime and the current stockout, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current average of 97 units/period across the lead time (L+1=5). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Period 33-35 demand averages 97 units/period, a ~73% increase from the late-summer plateau of 56 units, likely reflecting back-to-school or transitional fall seasonality.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in an 'autumn demand regime' with an average demand of approximately 97 units per period based on the last four weeks (P33-P36). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is reporting stockouts in P35 and P36. The pipeline inventory (463 units) is primarily composed of orders from P33 onwards (69 + 126 + 137 + 131), which are scheduled to arrive from P37 to P40. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Given the high criticality of maintaining stock during this autumn surge and the 4-period lead time, I will use a recent demand window (N=4) to set mu_hat, ensuring the OR engine targets enough base stock to cover demand through the lead time. Sigma_hat is also set using the recent window to account for the increased volatility seen during the transition from the low-demand plateau to the current regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn regime (late October). Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) shows values of 120, 90, 81, 54, 105, averaging 90 units/period. The current stock status is critical: On-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts intermittently since P35. An arrival of 69 units in P37 was immediately exhausted. We have orders from P34-P37 (126, 137, 131, 69) in transit. Although the promised lead time is 4, recent arrivals (P32 order in P36, P33 order in P37) confirm the lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19:$1), we must target a high service level. However, a significant amount (463 units) is already in the pipeline. I will set the demand forecast based on the recent autumn regime (N=5) to maintain sufficient safety stock while waiting for the larger in-transit quantities to arrive.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-04 (Period 39). We are in an autumn demand regime for the 'short skater skirt'. Recent demand (P37-P38) has spiked to an average of 116 units/period (P37: 105, P38: 127), which is higher than the previous autumn stabilization average of 97. The SKU is currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for the last four periods), and on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and ensure the OR engine targets a sufficient base stock, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the elevated autumn demand (P33-P38 average is approx 96 units). I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen during this period (ranging from 54 to 127).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge intensified: Period 37-38 average demand increased to 116 units/period compared to the P33-35 average of 97, resulting in persistent stockouts.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (Jessy Jersey Skirt) is currently in an autumn demand surge. Demand over the last 7 periods (P33-P39) has averaged 93.8 units per period, significantly higher than the late-summer plateau of 56. Recent demand specifically in P37 (105), P38 (127), and P39 (80) shows high volatility and sustained strength. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this autumn regime (average ~94) across the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=7 to account for the heightened volatility (varying from 54 to 127). The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by multiple recent arrivals (P36, P37, P38, P39). Inventory is currently recovering from recent stockouts with 57 units on hand and 420 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P33-P39) confirmed with an average of 93.8 units/period, marked by higher volatility (range 54-127) compared to the stable late-summer period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-18 (beginning of Period 41). We are in the 'Autumn demand regime' which has shown an average demand of 93.8 units/period from P33 to P39, but more recent samples (P39: 80, P40: 71) suggest a softening as we approach late November. On-hand inventory is 117. With a stable lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 375 units (comprising orders from P37: 69, P38: 79, P39: 141, P40: 86). Total position (inventory + in-transit) is 492 units. Using an 'explicit' L=4 based on consistent history. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=8 (P33-P40) to capture the full autumn regime including the recent taper. For sigma_hat, recent_N=8 captures the high volatility observed in this period (range 54-127), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for potential late-season spikes or pre-holiday interest.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Demand history shows an autumn surge beginning around P33, which has stabilized into a high-volatility regime. The last three periods (P39-P41) saw demand of 80, 71, and 90, averaging 80.3 units/period. This is lower than the peak surge (P38 saw 127) but significantly higher than the late-summer plateau of 56. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 6 periods remaining in the simulation, and a total pipeline (on-hand 96 + in-transit 361) of 457 units, we already have approximately 5.7 periods of safety coverage at the current 80 unit/period rate. The OR backend needs to maintain this balance without over-ordering as the end of the year approaches. I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current autumn stabilization (N=9, covering P33-P41), and 'calculate' for lead time since historical performance is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P33-P41) stabilized at an average of 86.4 units/period with sustained high volatility (range 54-127).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (Jessy Jersey Skirt) experienced a massive demand spike (243 units) in Period 42 (Nov 25), coinciding with Black Friday week. This surge resulted in a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). Given the date is now Dec 2, we are entering the holiday shopping peak. Historical 'Autumn/Fall' demand (P33-P41) averaged 86.4 units, but this recent spike represents a significant outlier that must be partially accounted for in the forecast to prevent continued stockouts during December. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 0 on-hand and 365 in-transit (P39-P42 orders), we need to ensure mu_hat reflects this elevated holiday demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the autumn baseline while incorporating the recent volatility, and an explicit lead time of 4 to match consistent observations.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Dec 2 date confirms demand spike in Period 42 (243 units) was likely a Black Friday event. Transitioning into holiday/December demand regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 is December 9th, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday holiday shopping season. Historical demand for the 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' showed a massive spike in Period 42 (243 units), identified as the Black Friday event. Period 43 demand (112 units) remains high compared to the autumn average (~93), confirming a sustained holiday demand regime. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 29 units on-hand and 418 in-transit, we must ensure our parameters account for the increased holiday demand to prevent stockouts while considering the substantial pipeline. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current holiday trend (P39-P43 average: 121.2) while maintaining lead time at the promised 4 periods. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the high volatility observed during the Black Friday peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: Period 43 demand (112 units) remains significantly above the autumn average (93.8), following the Black Friday peak of 243 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday shopping period (Dec 16). Demand has surged after the Black Friday event (P42: 243 units) and continues to be high (P43: 112 units, P44: 118 units) compared to the autumnal average of 93.8. The SKU is currently stocked out at the start of Period 45, despite an arrival of 86 units in Period 44. To ensure availability during the final pre-Christmas peak and subsequent post-holiday demand, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this holiday regime specifically (average demand ~157 per period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting parameters to maintain a higher base stock to recover from the current stockout and cover the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed (P42-P44): Demand significantly elevated starting late November (Black Friday), with an average of 157.7 units over the last 3 periods, necessitating higher base stock levels to prevent sustained stockouts.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, positioning us in the late holiday/pre-Christmas season. History shows a holiday demand regime starting at P42 (Black Friday peak of 243). While P45 demand dropped to 70 units, this was likely a stockout-constrained observation (on-hand was only 55), meaning actual demand was higher. The true holiday regime (P42-P44) average is ~157. However, given the date is Dec 23, we expect demand to taper significantly post-Christmas (Period 46/47). The pipeline is very full (721 units), primarily due to large orders placed in P43-P45 to chase the holiday surge. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat (covering P42-P45) to capture the elevated holiday mean while acknowledging the P45 data point. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect high holiday volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we are approaching the final period (47), and have 721 units in transit (far exceeding any likely demand for 2 periods), these parameters will result in a zero order to avoid excess holding costs at the end of the simulation.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, which is the end of the holiday peak and the start of the post-holiday taper for a 'short skater skirt' (a seasonal clothing item). Demand has shown a significant drop in Period 46 (42 units) compared to the holiday surge (P42-P44 average 157) and the earlier autumn average (93.8). This suggests the holiday regime has ended. Pipeline inventory is extremely high (871 units), with large orders placed in P43-P46 (averaging 217 units/period) arriving soon. To prevent a massive inventory surplus and high holding costs in the low-demand January period, I will use a shorter demand window (recent_N with N=3) for mu_hat to capture the downward shift (P44-P46 average = 76.6). This will lower the base stock calculation and allow the OR backend to stop ordering, given the massive 'in-transit' volume already exceeds foreseeable demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand taper confirmed: Period 46 demand (42 units) is significantly lower than the P42-P45 holiday average (135), signaling the end of the seasonal peak.
