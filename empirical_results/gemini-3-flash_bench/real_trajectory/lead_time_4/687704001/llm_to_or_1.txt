Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 687704001, a ladies' high-waisted super-skinny ankle denim. The product description suggests it's a staple fashion item. Historical data (last 5 weeks) shows zero demand initially, followed by a significant ramp-up: 0, 0, 56, 216, 319. This indicates a launch phase or a strong upward trend heading into the spring season. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 0. Given the rapid increase in demand (mean of last 3 samples is ~197), using the simple mean of all samples (minimized by early zeros) would lead to stockouts. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the current demand velocity. For L, I will use 'default' (promised = 4). mu_hat needs to cover (1+L) = 5 periods. With the last 3 samples averaging 197, I expect demand across the lead time to be significant.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a pair of ladies' skinny jeans, which typically has steady demand but is currently seeing a ramp-up. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 0, 0, 56, 216, 319, and most recently 276 in Period 1. The average of the last three periods (216, 319, 276) is approximately 270. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 415 units in transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 4, this order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture this recent demand level, and use the promised lead time (L=4) as we have no evidence of deviation yet. The goal is to build inventory to meet the established demand level once shipments begin arriving.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU 687704001 is a 'Super-Skinny Ankle' denim item. Historical demand (pre-game + P1-P2) shows: 0, 0, 56, 216, 319, 276, 207. This suggests the product likely launched around late January. The recent demand (P1: 276, P2: 207) averaged 241.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 771 units in transit (415 from P1, 356 from P2). The promised lead time is 4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected at the start of Period 6). Since we have no stock and demand is fairly stable but high for a new launch, I will use a recent_N method (N=3) to capture the current demand level of approximately 267 units/week (average of 319, 276, 207). This ensures mu_hat covers 5 weeks (L+1) of demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility as the product stabilizes post-launch. L is set to default (4).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 4 (2019-03-04), we are managing a 'Ladies Denim' product with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the game is currently at Period 4, no orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales for the first 3 periods. Historical demand data shows a significant ramp-up in Jan/Feb (from 0 to 319), followed by a cooling trend in the game history (276, 207, 163). This suggests a post-launch or post-seasonal peak deceleration. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this downward trend (average of ~215/week) rather than the long-term average which includes the initial zeros. For sigma, I will also use N=3 to reflect recent volatility. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4 periods, as we have no 'conclude' messages to suggest otherwise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a staple item (Ladies Denim). Demand has stabilized after an initial spike, with the last four periods averaging 207 units (276, 207, 163, 184). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect it to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all previous orders (totaling 1132 units) are in-transit. To ensure we cover demand for the next (L+1) = 5 periods, and accounting for the 1132 units already in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand regime (last 4 samples) to avoid over-ordering while waiting for the initial shipments to arrive and satisfy the stock-out.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle Trousers Denim'. Historical demand samples (before P1) were 0, 0, 56, 216, 319. Since the game started (P1-P5), actual demand has been: 276, 207, 163, 184, 158. There is a clear downward trend from the initial peak around the start of February. The mean demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 198 units/period. The promised lead time is 4. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 (as expected). Currently, On-hand is 257. In-transit is 717 (orders from P2=356 and P3=361). These are expected to arrive in P6 and P7 respectively. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand level (avg ~198) rather than the earlier spikes, ensuring the OR engine calculates a base stock suitable for the current trend to avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand history (including pre-game samples) shows a spike in early February followed by a decline: 0, 0, 56, 216, 319 (samples), then 276, 207, 163, 184, 158, 129 in current history. The mean demand of the last 4 periods (P3-P6) is 158.5 units/period. The product is a staple item (Ladies Denim), and we are moving away from early spring peaks into a more stable regime. On-hand inventory is 484 units, and in-transit is 375 (P3 order of 361 arriving P7, P6 order of 14 arriving P10). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P1 and P2 arrivals). We will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this lower/stabilizing demand trend, avoiding the earlier high-inventory bias. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a staple item (ladies' denim skinny jeans). Historical demand since February has been: 276, 207, 163, 184, 158, 129, and 169. There was a notable drop after the initial spike (P1/P2), and demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (mean ~160.6). Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Total demand across the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 803 units. Current inventory status: On-hand = 676, In-transit = 14 (Total Pipeline = 690). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend targeted service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the base stock should roughly equal the expected demand over (L+1) periods. Using the recent 5 periods (P3-P7) provides a more accurate representation of current demand stability compared to the initial high-demand launch weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized starting Period 3: avg demand ~161 (down from ~240 in P1-P2); Lead time confirmed as 4 periods based on P1, P2, and P3 deliveries.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Analyzing the demand history, we saw a slight drop after the first two weeks (which might have been pre-launch or initial stock-up hype). From Period 3 onwards, demand has stabilized around a mean of 166 units (samples: 163, 184, 158, 129, 169, 193). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3). On-hand inventory is currently high (483 units) due to the large early orders (P1-P3) finally arriving. Total pipeline (on-hand 483 + in-transit 127 = 610) currently covers approximately 3.6 periods of demand at the current average. Since Lead time L=4, we need coverage for (L+1)=5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the stable demand regime starting at Period 3. This will guide the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock level while accounting for the high on-hand position, likely resulting in a small or zero order this period to bleed off excess inventory safely.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/15. Historical demand shows a downward shift after the first two periods (avg ~161 vs ~240). Recent demand in Period 9 was even lower at 104, making recent_N forecasting appropriate to avoid overstocking, especially since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. On-hand (379) plus In-transit (330) equals 709 units. With an estimated weekly demand of ~160, this covers over 4 periods, which aligns with the confirmed 4-period lead time. No orders were placed in P4 or P5, explaining the current 'arrived=0' in P8-P9. We expect the small P6 order (14 units) to arrive in Period 10 Conclusion (visible P11). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 (P3-P9) to capture the stabilized lower demand regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019/04/22). The product is a staple item (Women's Skinny Denim). Historical demand shows a downward trend: Period 1-3 averaged ~215, Periods 4-7 averaged ~160, and Periods 8-10 averaged ~126. This suggests current demand is cooling off from earlier weeks. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P1, P2, P3, and P6 orders). On-hand inventory is 312, and In-transit is 393 (total pipeline: 705). Pipeline orders include P8 (ordered 113, due P12), P9 (ordered 203, due P13), and P10 (ordered 77, due P14). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. The OR backend will target the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent lower demand trend (avg ~130/week), and default (promised) for lead time. This will help prevent overstocking as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: Average demand has decreased to ~126 units/week (Periods 8-10) compared to ~160 earlier; Lead time stability at 4 periods confirmed across all deliveries to date.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we are managing a ladies' denim SKU. Analyzing the demand history, we observed a shift around Period 8. The demand for the last four periods (P8-P11) was 193, 104, 81, and 90, averaging 117 units per week. This aligns with the 'carry_over_insight' regarding a recent downward trend. On-hand inventory is 222, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 393, totaling 615 units. Promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by historical arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P6->P10). With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the recent mean demand of 117, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 585 units. Since our total inventory (615) covers this projection, the OR engine will likely order a minimal amount to maintain the base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time since evidence remains stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P8-P11) is 117 units, confirming a significant drop from the P3-P7 average of 161.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/6), we continue to observe a stabilized lower demand regime. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 112.2 units, which is significantly lower than the initial weeks. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Order from Period 8 (P8) in Period 12. Current status shows 242 units on-hand and 280 units in-transit (Orders from P9, P10). Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base stock should target the median demand (z=0). Using L=4 (promised and confirmed) means we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My goal is to prevent overstocking as demand has cooled substantially. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this lower-demand, lower-variance regime while maintaining the default lead-time calculation path.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). Analysis of demand history shows a clear downward trend across three regimes: P1-P2 (avg ~240), P3-P7 (avg ~161), and P8-P13 (avg ~91). The most recent six periods (P8-P13) yield demands of 193, 104, 81, 90, 93, 66. Excluding the outlier of 193 in P8, the average is ~87. Given the 'Embrace' skinny jeans are a staple product, this drop might be seasonal or a stabilization of initial high launch demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P1, P2, P3, P6, P8, P9 all arrived with exactly 4 periods lead time). My strategy is to use the most recent 6 periods (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (~91 units/period), as using the full history would significantly overestimate demand and lead to excessive holding costs ($1/unit). L is set to default as the promised lead time (4) is perfectly consistent with observations. Pipeline inventory consists of orders from P10 (77 units) and P13 (39 units), totaling 116 units, with P10 expected to arrive this period (P14).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 8: Average demand for the last 6 periods (P8-P13) dropped to 104.5 units, with the last 5 periods (P9-P13) averaging 86.8 units, reflecting a ~50% decrease from the P3-P7 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-338.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a significant and sustained downward trend in demand. For the last six periods (P9-P14), demand has averaged approximately 82 units, significantly lower than the P1-P8 levels. Specifically, the last three periods (P12-P14) have seen demand drop to 93, 66, and 59 units respectively. On-hand inventory is currently high (397 units) relative to this new demand regime, especially considering a lead time of 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory alone covers nearly 5 weeks of demand, and there are still 67 units in-transit. To avoid excessive holding costs in this declining demand environment, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the lower average demand (approx. 82 units per week) and adjusting the lead time parameter L to 'calculate' based on the consistent 4-period delivery performance observed in history. This will signal the OR backend to lower the base stock level and likely result in zero or very small orders until on-hand inventory is leaner.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift continues: Average demand for the last 6 periods (P9-P14) has further decreased to approximately 82 units per week, down from the P8-P13 average of 104.5 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-27. Demand has shown a steady decline from the initial regime; the average demand for the last seven periods (P9-P15) is approximately 77.3 units, significantly lower than the P1-P8 average of ~185. The most recent demand (P15) was 48 units, following a trend of 104, 81, 90, 93, 66, 59, 48. This suggests the product is entering a late-lifecycle or low-seasonality phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P10 order arrived P14). On-hand inventory is 349, which covers roughly 4-5 weeks of current demand, and there are 67 units in-transit (from P13 and P14 orders). Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning we target the median. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to capture the current lower demand trend and ensure we don't over-order into a high holding cost situation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 9: Average demand for the last 7 periods (P9-P15) is 77.3 units, continuing the downward trend from the P3-P8 average of ~160.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (Super Skinny Ankle Jeans) is exhibiting a sustained downward demand trend. Average demand has shifted from ~160 (P3-P8) to ~104 (P8-P13) and most recently to ~56 units over the last 4 periods (P13-P16: 66, 59, 48, 34). The current on-hand inventory is 315 units, which exceeds the estimated demand for the next 5 periods (L+1 = 5) based on the recent average (56 * 5 = 280). With in-transit stock of 67 units (orders from P13 and P14), the total position is 382 units. Given the seasonality of denim (often peaking in spring and tapering toward summer), this decline is consistent with the June 3rd date. I will use a conservative N=4 to capture the most recent local demand regime (mean 51.75) and maintain L=4 (promised and verified lead time) to prevent over-ordering while the system burns through excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 13: Average demand for the last 4 periods (P13-P16) is 51.75 units, a significant drop from the P9-P12 average of 92 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-292.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' (Embrace Super Skinny Jeans) is experiencing a continued and significant downward demand trend. Looking at the history, demand has dropped from ~160 (P3-P7) to ~90 (P9-P12) and most recently to ~43 (P13-P17). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 323 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate of roughly 30-40 units per period and a lead time of 4 periods. The total pipeline (on-hand 323 + in-transit 28 = 351) covers more than 8 periods of the current demand level. Any further ordering would significantly increase holding costs without improving service levels. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17) to reflect this lower regime (avg ~43.6), and keep L at the promised 4 periods as it has remained stable throughout. The OR backend's inventory cap logic will prevent new orders due to the high stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 13: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is 47.6 units, confirming the continued decline from previous levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-307.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the SKU 687704001 continues its significant downward trend, likely due to seasonal shifts as we move further into June. The current date is 2019/06/17. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), demand has averaged 43.3 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P16-P18) have averaged only 29 units. The current on-hand inventory is 329 units with 0 in-transit. This stock level is extremely high relative to current demand (covering more than 7 weeks even at the P13-P18 average). With profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) being equal, the OR engine seeks a 50% service level. My objective is to prevent further ordering and work through the existing excess inventory to minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (N=6) to ensure the base stock calculation stays well below the current on-hand plus pipeline total, effectively resulting in zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 13: Average demand for the last 6 periods (P13-P18) is 43.3 units, with the 3 most recent periods (P16-P18) averaging only 29 units, confirming a continued decline in product relevance/seasonality.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (Super Skinny Ankle Jeans) is exhibiting a clear and sustained downward demand trend. Since the shift identified in Period 13, demand has dropped from an average of ~48 to ~29 over the last three weeks (P17-P19). On-hand inventory is currently 309 units, which, at the most recent average demand of ~20-30 units, covers more than 10 periods of supply. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. Given the significant overstock relative to current demand and the downward trend, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P16-P19) to reflect the current low-demand regime (average ~26.75). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. No new orders are expected or needed to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 16: Average demand for the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is 26.75 units, reflecting a continued and aggressive decline in performance as the season progresses.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (skinny ankle high-waist jeans) is experiencing a severe and sustained demand decline as the calendar enters July. Demand has dropped from an average of ~160 in early periods to just 5 units in the most recent period (P20). The average demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 22.4 units, but the last 3 weeks (P18-P20) show an even lower average of 15.6. Currently, we have 304 units on-hand with zero in-transit shipments. Given the current demand rate, this on-hand inventory provides over 13 weeks of coverage (304 / 22.4), which is far beyond the 5-week protection interval (L+1) required. My objective is to prevent further accumulation of units that will incur heavy holding costs, as the profit margin is slim ($1) relative to the holding cost ($1). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (representing the current low-demand regime since P16) to ensure the OR backend's target base stock stays well below our current on-hand inventory, thus effectively halting any new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 16: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) has dropped to 22.4 units, with the most recent period (P20) showing a seasonal low of only 5 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product (Embrace Super Skinny Ankle High Waist Jeans) has shown a consistent and aggressive downward demand trend since May (Period 13). The most recent 3 periods (P19-P21) have recorded demand values of 20, 5, and 9 respectively, averaging only 11.3 units per week. This follows a broader regime shift stabilized around Period 16, where demand dropped from the mid-40s to the low 20s and then into single digits. Inventory is currently at 295 units on-hand with zero in-transit, which at current demand levels represents over 20 weeks of coverage. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, we are heavily overstocked and must avoid any new orders. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P17-P21) to capture the most recent seasonal lows (average ~15) while allowing the backend's base-stock calculation to recognize that existing stock far exceeds the required levels. This will result in zero orders and minimize further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: Average demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 16.5 units, with the 3 most recent periods (P19-P21) averaging 11.3 units, signaling the end of the seasonal peak for this style.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a severe end-of-season decline. Current date is mid-July (2019/7/15). The demand regime shift that began around Period 16 is now firmly entrenched at single-digit levels, with the last 3 periods (P20-P22) averaging only 7.7 units. On-hand inventory is 286 units with zero in-transit, which at current demand levels represents over 30 weeks of supply. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), excess inventory is highly detrimental. I will use recent_N=4 for demand forecasting to capture this absolute minimum demand level (averaging ~8 units/week) and keep lead time at the stable 4 periods. The goal is to prevent any further ordering by maintaining parameters that reflect the reality that we are significantly overstocked for the current demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 19: Average demand for the last 4 periods (P19-P22) is 10.75 units, but the last 3 periods (P20-P22) average only 7.67 units, confirming the end of the product's seasonal cycle.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W' jeans (a ladies' fashion item) is at the clear end of its seasonal lifecycle. Current date is July 22, 2019. Demand has plummeted from an average of ~160 in the early periods to just 7.25 units per week over the last four periods (P20-P23: 5, 9, 9, 6). Current on-hand inventory is 280 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents nearly 40 weeks of supply. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), maintaining high stock is financially detrimental. There is zero pipeline inventory. The strategy is to halt all ordering and allow the system to deplete the existing stock. For the OR parameters, I am using a 'recent_N' of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current ultra-low demand environment, while keeping lead time at the stable observed value of 4 periods. The goal is to ensure the base stock calculation remains significantly lower than the current inventory level to prevent any new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Demand has entered a terminal seasonal low, averaging only 7.25 units/week over Periods 20-23.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a terminal demand phase as it enters late July (Period 25). Historical demand from Period 20 to 24 has been extremely low: 5, 9, 9, 6, and 12 units, averaging 8.2 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 268 units with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate, the existing stock will last for over 30 periods, which far exceeds the remaining 23 periods of the game (total periods = 47). Consequently, no further orders should be placed to minimize holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. To prevent the OR backend from triggering any orders despite the high inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in terminal low phase (P20-P24): average 8.2 units/week, down from previous regime of ~26 units. On-hand stock (268) is sufficient for all remaining periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a terminal demand phase, although Period 25 saw a sudden spike in demand (58 units) compared to the previous four-week average (approx. 8 units). Given the high on-hand inventory (210 units) and the product description's seasonal nature (ankle-length skinny jeans), this spike is likely a clearance event or data volatility rather than a sustained trend reversal. With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, and we are heavily overstocked relative to current demand needs. No new orders are necessary as on-hand inventory covers more than 20 weeks of demand at the current average rate. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the recent spike while acknowledging the low-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat reflects the current state without triggering unnecessary orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-68.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows an unexpected spike in Period 25 (58 units) and Period 26 (71 units), after a long terminal low phase of ~8 units per week. This suggests either a mid-August back-to-school promotional bump or a clearance event for this item. Despite this spike, on-hand inventory is currently 139 units, which is still more than double the highest recent demand (71) and significantly above any foreseeable 5-period (L+1) horizon demand based on the current run rate (~129 units total if P26 demand continues, but more likely to stabilize lower). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) which equals the profit margin ($1.0), maintaining excess stock is detrimental to total reward. I will set the base stock level to reflect the new higher demand regime using recent_N=3 to capture the spike while avoiding more orders until on-hand stock is depleted further. No new orders are needed this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected starting Period 25: average demand increased from ~8 units (P20-P24) to ~65 units (P25-P26), potentially due to late-summer seasonality or promotions.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19 (late summer). A significant demand spike was detected starting in Period 25. Demand for the last three periods (P25-P27) was 58, 71, and 101, averaging 76.7 units per week. This contrasts sharply with the previous regime (P20-P24), which averaged ~8 units. The On-hand inventory has dropped rapidly to 38, and we have 96 in-transit from the order placed last period (P27), which is expected to arrive in Period 31 given the stable lead time of 4. Since the spike is accelerating (101 in P27), I will use the last 3 samples to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to ensure the OR backend reacts quickly to the new demand level and avoids stockouts. L is set to calculated as the actual lead time has consistently been the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike accelerated in P27 (101 units); Average demand P25-P27 is 76.7 units/week, up from ~8 in the prior regime (P20-P24).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out-of-stock (on-hand: 0) following a significant demand resurgence that began in Period 25. The last four periods (P25-P28) saw demand values of 58, 71, 101, and 74, averaging 76 units/week, a stark contrast to the terminal low of ~8 units/week observed in P20-P24. This looks like a late-summer/back-to-school spike for denim. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 209 units in transit (ordered in P27 and P28) and nothing arriving until P31, we need to ensure our base stock level reflects this higher demand regime to minimize lost sales while being mindful of the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 captures the current peak (average 76) and projects it across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand resurgence confirmed starting Period 25: average demand P25-P28 is 76.0 units/week, likely driven by late-summer/back-to-school seasonality for jeans.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a significant late-summer/back-to-school demand resurgence. Over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), demand has averaged 80.8 units/week (58, 71, 101, 74, 100). This is a sharp contrast to the terminal low phase (avg ~8 units). Currently, the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0) and facing lost sales (100 units in P29). There are 315 units in-transit (ordered P27, P28, P29), but with a 4-period lead time, the first shipment (96 units from P27) won't arrive until the start of Period 32. To address this demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the new average of ~81 units per week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical evidence. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility of this new peak period. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the recent surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand resurgence sustained: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is 80.8 units/week, a nearly 10x increase from the P20-P24 average of 8.2 units, confirming a back-to-school/autumn seasonal peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (skinny jeans) is currently experiencing a significant autumn/back-to-school demand surge. The most recent demand (Period 30) hit 157 units, confirming an accelerating trend compared to the P25-P29 average. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is 93.5 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 404 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, the 96 units ordered in P27 are expected to arrive in Period 31, and the 113 units from P28 in Period 32. Given the clear demand acceleration, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the resurgence while allowing the OR backend to handle the current stockout and pipeline reconciliation. This N covers the entire resurgence regime starting Period 25. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand resurgence accelerated at Period 30: demand hit 157 units, bringing the P25-P30 average to 93.5 units/week (+15% vs P25-P29).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a significant autumn/back-to-school demand resurgence. Demand has increased for seven consecutive weeks (P25-P31), with P31 reaching 161 units. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) is 139.3 units, compared to the P25-P31 average of 103 units, indicating an accelerating trend. We currenty have 0 on-hand inventory. The first replenishment from the resurgence phase (ordered P27) arrived in P31 and was immediately sold out, leaving a deficit (demand 161 vs 96 arrived). We have 372 units in-transit (ordered P28-P31). Given the seasonality of 'Ladies Denim' in September, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand velocity (approx 139 units/week) and a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand resurgence acceleration: P29-P31 average demand reached 139.3 units/week, up from P25-P28 average of 76 units, confirming a strong autumn seasonal peak for denim.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a strong autumn seasonal peak (Late Sept/Oct), with several weeks of sustained high demand. Period 32 demand was 146 units, and the average over the last 3 periods (P30-P32) is 154.7 units. The system is currently severely stock-constrained (ending on-hand is 0, demand is being lost). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are in a rapid growth/peak phase, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current velocity (154.7 units/week), which resulting base stock will help the OR engine recover from the stockout. Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to account for the heightened volatility during this peak. L is set to default as the 4-period lead time is consistently confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak acceleration confirmed: Average demand for P30-P32 is 154.7 units/week, a significant increase from the P25-P29 average of 80.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a major seasonal peak (autumn/back-to-school for denim). Period 33 demand spiked dramatically to 342 units, significantly higher than the previous 3-period average of ~155. This indicates the peak is accelerating. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and while 524 units are in transit, the immediate pipeline is insufficient given this demand acceleration. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (Periods 30-33) to capture the upward trend. This results in a mu_hat of approx 1012.75 units (5 * 201.55) to cover the next 5 periods (Review + Lead Time). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Period 33 demand reached 342 units, a 120% increase over the P30-P32 average (154.7); current seasonal regime average (P30-P33) is 201.5 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant autumn seasonal peak, typical for denim. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 342, followed by a still-high 214 in Period 34. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have been stocking out consistently since Period 28, indicating that our recent base stock levels have been insufficient to meet this surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 204 units. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the risk of continued stockouts during this peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture this higher regime and using an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed (std of P30-P34 is approximately 78, and sqrt(1+L)*78 \u2248 174). I've set mu_hat to (1+L)*204 = 1020. This will push the OR backend to place a larger order now to recover from the current inventory deficit (pipeline is 791, but we need to cover the lead time + one review period of high demand).

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak hit a high of 342 units in Period 33; regime average for P30-P34 is 204 units/week, significantly requiring higher safety stock during this period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn season for denim (SKU 687704001). The product is experiencing a major demand resurgence since Period 25, peaking in Period 33 (342 units). The demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) has averaged 210.6 units (113, 113, 106, 89, 64 were sold out of demands: 161, 146, 342, 214, 190), resulting in zero on-hand inventory due to stockouts. Previous shipments (P27-P31) have consistently arrived with a 4-period lead time. With zero on-hand inventory and high unmet demand, the priority is to set parameters that represent this high-demand regime to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the lead time (L=4) plus current period. I am using recent_N=6 to capture the high-demand regime starting from Period 30, where demand significantly spiked above 150 units per week. This ensures the base stock reflects the current seasonal peak (avg ~209 units/week).

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn seasonal peak: Average demand for the last 6 periods (P30-P35) is 208.8 units/week, with frequent stockouts indicating current stock levels and pipeline are insufficient for the seasonal high.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a sustained autumn seasonal peak. Over the last 7 periods (P30-P36), demand has averaged 198.4 units per week, with a significant spike of 342 units in Period 33. On-hand inventory is currently very low (19 units) because recent arrivals (P27-P31 orders) were insufficient to cover the demand surge, leading to multiple stockouts. However, there is a large pipeline of 806 units (ordered P33-P36) currently in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on the most recent arrival (P32 order arrived in P36). I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while the OR backend manages the transition. The inventory levels should begin to recover as the large orders from P33 onwards start arriving from P37.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak sustained: Average demand for P30-P36 is ~198 units/week; lead time stable at 4 periods based on P32 delivery in P36.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (skinny jeans) is in a high-demand autumn seasonal peak (late October). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a demand of 213 in Period 37, which exceeded the sum of starting inventory and arrival (187). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (Period 33 order arrived in Period 37). The demand regime for the last 8 periods (P30-P37) shows a mean of 200.8 units/week. However, the last 4 periods (P34-P37) show a slightly higher stability around 200 units (214, 190, 184, 213). To handle this high-demand phase and prevent further stockouts, I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat (N=8 covers the entire current high-demand regime) to capture the seasonal average, and recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen during this peak (including the 342 spike). L is set to calculated as lead time has been consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak stabilized around Period 30: Average demand P30-P37 is ~201 units/week, characterized by high volume and moderate volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P39 (2019/11/04). We are in the midst of a sustained autumn seasonal peak for denim (Ladies Denim Trousers). Since Period 30, demand has averaged 200.4 units per week, with a peak of 342 in Period 33. The last two periods (P37-P38) saw demand of 213 and 192, respectively, confirming that the high-demand regime is stable but volatile. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P34 order arrived in P38). With only 8 periods remaining in the game (ending P47), we must ensure sufficient stock to cover the current peak while being mindful of potential end-of-season drop-offs that typically occur mid-to-late November. I will use a 'recent_N' of 9 periods (P30-P38) to capture the current seasonal mean (~200) and volatility. The pipeline (649) plus on-hand (164) is 813 units, which covers about 4 periods of demand at the current rate; additional orders are needed to satisfy the (L+1) window and maintain safety stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Analysis of the autumn seasonal peak (Periods 30-39) shows a mean demand of 192.3 units/week. However, the last two periods (P38-P39) show a notable decline to 192 and 124 units respectively, suggesting we may be moving past the absolute peak of the November shopping season. On-hand inventory is 269 with a robust pipeline of 607 units (orders from P36-P39). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volume and recent dip, I will use a recent window (N=10, covering the entire active autumn peak) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation remains elevated enough to handle remaining November demand while beginning to account for the downward trajectory seen in Period 39 to avoid excessive overstock as we approach the end of the game (Period 47).

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak appears to have peaked in Period 33 (342 units) and is starting to decline as of Period 39 (124 units), though it remains significantly higher than the summer terminal low.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are targeting a single SKU (high-waisted super-skinny jeans). Analysis of the last 11 periods (P30-P40) indicates that the autumn peak (which hit a high of 342 units in P33) is now decelerating. Recent demand: P38=192, P39=124, P40=129. The average demand for the last 3 periods is 148.3 units, down from the P30-P37 average of ~201. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With 193 units on hand and 640 units in transit (expected arrivals over the next 4 periods), we are well-positioned to meet this tapering demand. To avoid overstocking at the end of the season (Period 47), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent downward trend and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen during the transition from the peak. L is set to 'default' as 4 periods remains accurate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (deceleration) confirmed at Period 39: Average demand for P39-P40 is 126.5 units, down ~37% from the P30-P38 average of 200.7 units, signaling the wind-down of the autumn seasonal peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25. The autumn seasonal peak for these jeans (Period 30-38, ~200 units/week) has definitively passed. We are now in a deceleration regime starting at Period 39. Demand for the last three periods (P39-P41) has been 124, 129, and 109, averaging 120.7 units/week. This represents a ~40% drop from the mid-autumn peak. With only 6 periods remaining (P42-P47) and a 4-period lead time, we must avoid over-ordering as the season ends. Currently, we have 255 on-hand and 469 in-transit (Total: 724). At the current 120 units/week, this covers ~6 weeks, which is exactly the remaining duration of the game. I will utilize the recent three periods (N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand level while maintaining the L=4 default lead time. This allows the backend to naturally reduce orders as pipeline inventory now exceeds projected terminal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration regime confirmed starting Period 39: Average demand for P39-P41 is 120.7 units/week, a significant decrease from the P30-P38 average of ~201 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019 (Period 43), near the end of the simulation (Period 47). Analyzing the demand history, we saw an autumn peak that peaked at 342 units in Period 33. Recent demand has been: P39: 124, P40: 129, P41: 109, and P42: 227. While P42 showed a sudden spike (potentially a holiday/Black Friday effect), the general trend since P39 has been a deceleration from the ~200 average. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P39-P42) is 147.25 units. We currently have 224 units on-hand and 273 units in-transit (ordered in P39: 187, P40: 86). Both shipments are expected to arrive within the next two periods (P43 and P44). With only 5 periods remaining in the game (P43-P47) and a total of 497 units available (on-hand + in-transit), we are well-covered even if demand persists at the P42 spike level (~150-200 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the post-peak transition while respecting the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 42 (227 units), possibly reflecting holiday shopping, though the preceding three periods (P39-P41) averaged 120.7 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9, 2019), approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47). The demand history shows a very volatile late-year pattern: a drop to 129 and 109 units (P40-P41), a spike to 227 (P42, likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday), followed by a sharp drop to 30 units in P43. Based on the product profile (stretch denim jeans), we expect residual holiday demand but a general cooling as we reach mid-December. Total inventory position is 703 units (381 on-hand + 322 in-transit). The in-transit units are from P40 (86 units) and P43 (236 units). Given the game ends at P47, the order placed today (P44) would arrive in P48 (after the game ends) due to the 4-period lead time. Therefore, we should not place any more orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent volatility (avg ~105) while acknowledging that on-hand stock is already more than sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in late Q4: P42 spike (227) followed by P43 collapse (30). Average demand for P39-P43 is 103.8 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16th (Period 45), approaching the end of the game at Period 47. Demand has become highly volatile in the last few weeks: P42 (227), P43 (30), and P44 (54). The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P39-P44) is 112.2 units, but the last two weeks average only 42 units. Given there are only 3 decisions remaining (P45, P46, P47) and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 49, which is past the game's end. Therefore, the primary objective is to manage the current on-hand inventory (413 units) and the final incoming shipment (236 units arriving in Period 47). Total inventory available before the game ends will be 649 units. Even if demand returns to the autumn peak average of ~200 units/period, 649 units would cover more than 3 periods. To avoid unnecessary holding costs for units that will not arrive in time or exceed expected demand, I will set mu_hat to a conservative estimate using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent deceleration while maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for the P42 volatility. L will remain at 'default' (4) as confirmed by history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Dec: P42 spike (227) followed by sharp decline (P43: 30, P44: 54). End-of-game logic applies: orders placed from Period 44 onwards will not arrive before game conclusion (P47).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47. The game concludes at the end of Period 47. Orders placed now (Period 46) or in the future will not arrive before the game ends (standard lead time is 4 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 354 units, which is significantly higher than the recent average demand (P39-P45 average is ~90 units). There are also 236 units in-transit (ordered in Period 43), but they will not arrive in time to resolve demand for the final period. Given that we have enough stock on-hand to cover the remaining period and any order placed now would only incur holding costs in the hypothetical future without being sold in this game, the order quantity should be zero. I will set the parameters to reflect the current demand regime (recent_N with N=7 for the deceleration phase starting at P39) but the backend logic will result in a zero order as inventory exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Dec 30, 2019 (Period 47). As the final period of the game, any order placed now will not arrive before the game concludes. Current on-hand inventory is 294 units, and based on the recent demand regime (P43-P46 average of 50.75 units/week), this is more than sufficient to cover final period demand without incurring unnecessary holding costs for additional units. Demand has stabilized into a late-December low-to-moderate regime after the Q4 volatility. I am maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of 5 periods to represent current demand levels, although the OR backend calculation will be moot as on-hand exceeds any realistic base stock for the final week.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-holiday: Average demand P43-P46 is ~51 units/week, reflecting a return to baseline after Q4 volatility.
