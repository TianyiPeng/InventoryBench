Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical demand samples are [1, 6, 7, 3, 15], showing an upward trend with the most recent sample (15) being significantly higher than the previous mean. This product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple fashion item. Given it's early February, we are moving past the post-holiday slump into the spring fashion cycle. The promised lead time is 4 periods. With on-hand and in-transit inventory at 0, we must establish a pipeline. I will use the last 5 samples to estimate demand and volatility, as they represent the most relevant recent behavior, while the 'default' lead time (4) is appropriate until we observe actual delivery performance.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a seasonal fashion item (high-waisted skinny jeans). Historical demand was low (avg 6.4/week) but spiked to 57 in Period 1, likely due to a seasonal transition into Spring trends. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 16 units in-transit from the Period 1 order. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Demand in Period 1 (57) significantly exceeded the historical mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this upward shift in demand while acknowledging the limited sample size of high-demand periods. For lead time, I will stick to 'default' as we have no conclusive evidence yet of variation from the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand has surged significantly in the last two periods (57 and 72), far exceeding the pre-launch samples (mean ~6). This indicates a strong launch or early-spring season demand for high-waisted skinny denim. Current inventory is 0 with 78 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the P1 order (16 units) isn't expected to arrive until the resolution of Period 5 (visible at P6 start). Because current demand (avg ~65 over last 2 periods) is significantly higher than the initial history, I will use a recent_N approach to capture this new regime. Mu_hat needs to cover the review period (1) + lead time (4) = 5 periods. Using N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot to the 57-72 demand range immediately to prevent prolonged stockouts. L is set to default as we have not yet observed any arrivals to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at launch (P1-P2): demand increased from 6 to ~65 (10x increase) compared to pre-launch history.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'High-waisted jeans in washed superstretch denim,' which shows a significant demand surge post-launch (Feb 11 onwards). Historical pre-launch demand averaged ~6.4, but current demand over the last 3 periods averaged 64.3 (P1: 57, P2: 72, P3: 64). We are currently in a stockout (On-hand: 0) with 160 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). To ensure we cover demand during the lead time (L) and the review period (1), we need to maintain a base stock for (L+1) = 5 periods. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the post-launch demand level (~64/period), which totals 320 units for the 5-period window. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the recent shift in volatility. The OR backend will subtract the 160 units already in-transit and apply the order cap to calculate this period's replenishment.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a standard fashion item. Historically (pre-launch), demand was low (1-15), but since Period 1, we have seen a significant regime shift with demand averaging 71.25 units per week (P1: 57, P2: 72, P3: 64, P4: 92). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (visibility in Period 6 START). Currently, On-hand is 0, and we have 237 units in transit (16+62+82+77). Because the demand shows an upward trend (reaching 92 in P4), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this growth while remaining grounded in the current regime. For lead time, I will use 'default' as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand over the first 4 periods is ~71 units, significantly higher than pre-launch history (~6). Period 4 saw a peak of 92.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', high-waisted skinny jeans. Historical demand samples (pre-launch) were very low (avg ~6), but since launch (Period 1), demand has surged and is trending upward: 57, 72, 64, 92, and now 112 in Period 5. This suggests a clear growth phase as we enter spring. Total demand over the last 5 periods is 397 (avg 79.4). Promised lead time is 4 periods; the Period 1 order (16 units) arrived in Period 5, confirming actual L=4 for that shipment. However, we have experienced severe stockouts (0 on-hand, 0 sales except for the small arrival in P5). Currently, 318 units are in transit. To prevent further stockouts and capture the increasing demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the post-launch regime (avg ~79.4), while L remains at the promised 4 periods. Since the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L)*mean_demand, using N=5 will provide a base for (1+4)*~80 = 400 units, helping to bridge the gap between our current in-transit (318) and the growing demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Period 5 demand reached 112, continuing the upward trend from the post-launch average of ~71. Lead time of 4 periods confirmed by Period 1 order arrival.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser (Divided Collection), which is a high-demand fashion staple. We are currently in late March (Period 7), and demand is exhibiting a strong upward trend: 57, 72, 64, 92, 112, 184. The Period 6 demand of 184 is a significant jump. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6. We are currently out of stock (ending OH is 0), and we have 373 units in-transit (P3: 82, P4: 77, P5: 97, P6: 117). With L=4, my parameters need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is ~129.3, but the most recent period (184) suggests the mean is still rising. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent acceleration but keep the mu_hat robust. I'll maintain 'default' for L and sigma_hat as they are behaving consistently given the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Period 6 demand (184) is a 64% increase over Period 5 (112), indicating a strong spring seasonal trend for this denim SKU.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' trouser, which is experiencing a significant demand surge in the spring season. Demand in Period 6 (184) and Period 7 (169) suggests a new regime vastly different from the early launch average. The average demand across the last 3 periods (P5-P7) is approximately 155 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by deliveries from P1, P2, and P3 arriving exactly in P5, P6, and P7. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts, while 516 units are in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). To adequately cover the lead time of 4 plus the current review period (L+1=5), and accounting for the strong demand trajectory, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the most recent high-demand regime. This corresponds to approximately 155 * 5 = 775 units for the base stock calculation, which will trigger necessary replenishment orders to catch up with the spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high levels: average demand for P6-P7 is ~176, significantly higher than the earlier post-launch average (~71). Seasonal spring peak for denim confirmed.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim SKU (High-waisted skinny jeans) entering mid-April, which is peak spring season for this category. Demand has shown a consistent upward trend since Period 1: 57 -> 72 -> 64 -> 92 -> 112 -> 184 -> 169 -> 209. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P6-P8) is approximately 187 units. Inventory levels are critical: currently on-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in every period because sales are limited by inventory arrival, not total demand. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on receipts from P1-P4. To capture the current high-demand regime and seasonal peak, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the high-volume weeks (avg 187, std ~20). L will remain at default (promised 4) as the actual lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high levels: average demand for P6-P8 is 187.3 units, significantly higher than the previous month's average (~85). Stockouts have occurred every period since launch due to insufficient initial orders and lead-time delay.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand for this high-waisted skinny denim SKU has shown a strong upward trend through the spring, stabilizing recently with an average demand of 175.5 units over the last four periods (P6-P9: 184, 169, 209, 140). The SKU has been stock-out constrained every period since launch (sold = arrived < demand), meaning the true potential demand is likely at or above these observed figures. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1 through P5. Currently, there are 0 units on-hand and 781 units in-transit (orders from P6-P9). The order from P6 (117 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P10) resolution. To stabilize inventory and meet the high spring demand, I will set L to 'calculate' (as the 4-period lead time is consistent). I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the current high-demand regime (~175.5 per period * (L+1)), and sigma_hat using the same window to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high spring levels: average demand P6-P9 is 175.5 units. Persistent stockouts since launch have likely masked true demand levels due to supply-side constraints.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for the High-waisted Denim SKU has stabilized following a significant spring surge that peaked around late March/early April (Period 8, demand=209). Period 10 was the first time since launch that supply finally met demand, with demand dropping to 110 units\u2014a 21.4% decrease from the previous period (140) and nearly 50% down from the peak. This indicates the start of a post-peak seasonal decline or demand stabilization. On-hand inventory is finally positive (7 units) with a massive pipeline of 815 units (representing orders from Periods 7-10). The confirmed lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and the downward trend in demand, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand levels (average of P9-P10 is 125) to prevent over-ordering as we move past the spring peak, while using the standard sigma_hat to maintain safety stock for potential volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak for Spring denim occurred around Period 8 (209 units). Recent demand (Period 10: 110 units) shows a 47% decrease from peak, signaling a shift to a lower post-peak demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical data for this item (high-waisted denim) shows a clear seasonal peak in late March/early April (Period 8, demand=209) followed by a cooling-off period. Demand over the last two periods has stabilized around 100 units (P10: 110, P11: 94). On-hand inventory is now finally positive (138) after 9 periods of stockouts, thanks to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With demand trending down from its spring peak, I will use a recent window (N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering based on the high-peak periods (P6-P8). This N=3 captures the post-peak trend (140, 110, 94). The backend will calculate base stock covering 5 periods (L+1), which is appropriate given the current stability.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime shift confirmed: Demand has dropped and stabilized at an average of ~102 units/period (P10-P11) from the peak average of ~187 units (P6-P8). Inventory levels have transitioned from chronic stockouts to a surplus position (138 on-hand).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016004' (denim trousers) has transitioned from its Spring peak (averaging ~187 units in Periods 6-8) to a lower, stable demand regime as May begins. Over the last three periods (P10-P12), demand has averaged 100.3 units (110, 94, 97), showing significant stabilization compared to previous volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed deliveries (P8 order arrived in P12). Current on-hand inventory is 259 units, and in-transit inventory is high (448 units), resulting from large orders placed during the peak demand phase. Combined, the pipeline and on-hand inventory (707 units) far exceed the requirements for the next 5 periods at the current demand rate (~100 units/period). Therefore, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the new lower demand level and prevent further overstocking, as the current supply is sufficient to cover demand for several weeks.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime for denim confirmed stable: Average demand for P10-P12 is 100.3 units, approximately 46% lower than the P6-P8 peak. High inventory levels (on-hand + pipeline) now exist due to past peak-chasing orders.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the High-waisted Denim SKUs has stabilized in a post-peak regime. The spring peak (P6-P8) averaged ~187 units, but current demand (P10-P13) has dropped and held steady at an average of 96.75 units (110, 94, 97, 86). The current date is May 13th, moving away from prime spring denim sales season. We currently have 394 units on hand and 227 units in transit (ordered in Periods 10 and 11), totaling 621 units of pipeline inventory. Given the current demand mean (~97) and a (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, our target base stock should be roughly 485-500 units. Since we have 621 units already, we are oversupplied. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect this lower stabilization point and use a consistent lead time (L=4) as confirmed by the continuous arrival history. No new order will be placed by the OR backend because pipeline inventory exceeds the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization confirmed at ~97 units/period over May (P10-P13), a ~50% reduction from the April peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. This denim SKU has transitioned from a high-demand spring peak (approx. 187 units/period during April) to a stable post-peak regime. Demand has been remarkably consistent over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), averaging 97.4 units per period (110, 94, 97, 86, 100). We are currently in a massive overstock position with 445 units on-hand and 76 units in-transit (ordered in Period 11, arriving in Period 15), total matching 521 units. At the current demand rate, this covers more than 5 periods of demand. The OR backend's inventory calculation (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the required base stock for a (L+1)=5 period window. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to reflect the current stabilized demand of approx 97 units across 5 periods (approx 485 units) using the last 5 periods of data (N=5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for SKU 706016004 has stabilized in a post-peak regime. In Period 15 (May 20), demand was 137, which is a slight increase but remains within the established range for this period (avg P10-P15 is approx 104). The current on-hand inventory is 384 units with no remaining units in transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, my base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent average of ~104 units/period, the target base stock would be around 520 units. With 384 units on hand, the OR engine will likely place an order. However, given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the fact that we are moving away from the peak spring denim season, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (covering Periods 10-15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the current demand stabilization while avoiding over-ordering based on the earlier April peaks. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed stable: Average demand for P10-P15 is 104 units, with a slight seasonal uptick in P15 (137). Pipeline is now empty, transitioning from surplus to a maintenance phase.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Period 16 demand was 151, which follows a Period 15 demand of 137. This suggests a seasonal 'early summer' increase compared to the May average of ~97. Current on-hand inventory is 233, and there are 134 units in-transit (ordered in Period 16), which are expected to arrive in Period 20 given the stable 4-period lead time. No arrivals occurred in Period 16 (as no orders were placed in Period 12). Demand in Period 17-21 must be covered. Average demand over the last 7 periods (P10-P16) is 125 units, which reflects the post-peak stabilization and the recent upward trend. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this stabilized yet slightly increasing demand. Sigma_hat will also use N=7 to account for moderate volatility (standard deviation ~25). The Lead Time L remains at the promised 4 periods as evidence confirms stability. This strategy aims to maintain inventory while the 'peak-chasing' surplus from April is gradually depleted.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand uptick detected: Average demand for Period 15-16 is 144 units, a 48% increase over the May average (~97), likely due to seasonal demand for superstretch skinny denim.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. We have entered an early summer demand uptick for this item (Jade HW Skinny Denim). Demand for the last three periods (P15-P17) has been 137, 151, and 163, showing a clear upward trend and a new regime compared to the May stabilization (~97). The average demand over these last 3 periods is ~150 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 70 and 285 units in-transit (ordered P16 and P17), we need to maintain a base stock that covers the L+1 window (5 periods). Using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat captures this current summer acceleration while avoiding over-weighting the previous lower May demand or the distant April peak. Since the profit/holding ratio is 4:1 (q=0.8), we maintain a healthy service level while monitoring for the end of the summer surge.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand uptick confirmed: Period 15-17 average demand is 150.3 units, representing a 55% increase over the May average (97) and reflecting late-spring into summer seasonality for skinny denim.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for this high-waisted skinny denim SKU has shown a summer uptick starting around Period 15. Although Period 18 saw a dip to 117 units, the average demand over the last 4 periods (P15-P18) is 142 units, significantly higher than the May average of ~97. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 457 units in-transit. The in-transit units represent orders from Periods 16, 17, and 18, which are expected to arrive in Periods 20, 21, and 22 respectively (based on the confirmed 4-period lead time). Period 19 will experience a stockout because no orders were placed in Period 15. To recover and maintain stock for the sustained summer demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent mean of 142 units. Sigma_hat is also set using N=4 to reflect recent volatility. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime sustained: Average demand for P15-P18 is 142 units, a 46% increase over the May baseline (~97). Stockout expected in Period 19 due to zero order in P15.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are in a 'Summer demand regime' for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim). Demand has shifted from a stabilized May average of ~97 units to a higher summer average (P15-P19) of 136.6 units. Despite seasonal strength, we have been stocked out for two periods (P18-P19) because no orders were placed between Period 12 and 15 while surplus inventory was clearing. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. With on-hand at 0 and a large pipeline of 632 units (ordered P16-P19), the first arrival is due in Period 20 (today's resolution phase, arriving after our decision). To cover demand through Period 24 (current + 4 lead periods), we need to maintain a base stock that reflects the current 136.6 demand mean. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this summer regime (P15-P19).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P15-P19): Average demand is 136.6, up ~40% from May levels. Stockouts P18-P19 will resolve in P20 as P16 order arrives.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. We have moved from a high spring peak for denim into a more moderate summer demand regime. Over the most recent 6 periods (P15-P20), demand has averaged 133.6 units, but the last three periods (P18-P20) show a slight cooling with values of 117, 115, and 89 respectively (avg 107). Currently, on-hand inventory is 45 units and pipeline inventory is 589 units. The Period 16 order of 134 units arrived on schedule in Period 20 (L=4), confirming stable lead times. The pipeline is heavily front-loaded with orders from P17-P19 (151, 172, 175) due to arrive in P21, P22, and P23. I will use a recent_N of 6 for demand forecasting (covering P15-P20) to capture the current summer regime, which averages ~134 units. While P20 was lower (89), using a 6-period window ensures we don't overreact to a single lower data point while accounting for mid-summer trends.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P15-P20) average stabilized at ~134 units/period, showing a ~30% increase from the May baseline (~100) but below the April peak (~180). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 22 (July 8, 2019). As we move into mid-summer, demand for heavy denim like super-skinny jeans has shown a distinct cooling trend. While the early summer (P15-P18) saw an uptick averaging ~142 units, demand over the last four periods (P18-P21) has trended downward (117, 115, 89, 78), averaging 99.75 units. This suggests the summer peak has passed and we are entering a lower demand regime or late-summer lull. Pipeline inventory is currently high (499 units) due to orders placed during the uptick phase, while on-hand inventory is 118. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this recent deceleration and avoid further overstocking as we already have significant incoming units compared to the current sales rate.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand for P18-P21 dropped to ~100 units/period, a ~30% decrease from the early summer peak (P15-P17 avg ~150).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for the last 4 periods (P19-P22) has dropped to an average of 93.25 units, confirming a mid-summer deceleration from the early summer peak of ~150 units. The most recent demand (P22) was 91 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 199 units, and 327 units are in-transit (orders from P19, P20, P21). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on historical arrivals. To avoid overstocking during this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering periods 18-22) to reflect the recent average demand of approximately 93 units per period. This results in a total base stock target across (1+L=5) periods. Given the high pipeline inventory relative to current demand, the OR backend will likely minimize or skip orders this period, allowing current stock to be absorbed.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand for P19-P22 is 93.25 units/period, a significant decrease from the early summer peak of ~150 units (P15-P17).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are in a mid-summer demand deceleration phase for these high-waisted denim trousers. Demand over the last 4 periods (P20-P23) has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 83.75 units/period (89, 78, 91, 77), which is a significant drop from the early summer peak of ~150 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (297 units) plus in-transit stock (152 units) from orders placed in P20 (91 units) and P21 (61 units), which are expected to arrive in P24 and P25 respectively. Total inventory position (on-hand + pipeline) is 449 units. Given the desired service level (z* for profit $4/holding $1 is approx 0.84, or q=0.8) and the lead time of 4, the inventory needed to cover L+1 (5) periods at the current mean (84) is roughly 420-450 units. Since we already have 449 units and demand is trending downward or stabilizing at low levels, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this mid-summer lull and prevent further overstocking as we move towards late summer.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand stabilization confirmed (P20-P23): average demand dropped to ~84 units/period, down ~40% from the early summer peak (P15-P17 avg ~150).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-198.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has significantly decelerated as we move into late July. The most recent demand (Period 24) dropped to 38 units, well below the mid-summer average of ~84 units. For the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand has been 89, 78, 91, 77, and 38, averaging approximately 75 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently high (350 units) with another 61 units in-transit. Given the downward trend and high existing stock, I am using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent deceleration and avoid overstocking. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current total potential inventory (411) significantly exceeds 5 units of current average demand (5 * 75 = 375), and the OR backend's cap mechanism will likely suppress any unnecessary ordering.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand deceleration confirmed: Period 24 demand (38) is the lowest since the launch phase, following a month-long decline. Average demand for P20-P24 is ~75 units/period, down from the June average of ~136.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a late-summer seasonal decline for high-waisted skinny denim. In Period 25, the date is August 5th, and the demand over the last two periods (P24-P25) has averaged 50 units (38 and 62 respectively), which is a significant drop from the June/early July average of ~134 units. We have a significant inventory surplus (349 on-hand) compared to the current demand levels. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains validated by historical arrivals. Given the clear downward trend and the high on-hand inventory which covers over 6 weeks of current demand, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower demand regime (averaging approx 65 units/period) and maintain a cautious approach to avoid further increasing the holding cost of the already large surplus. No new orders are likely to be triggered by the OR backend given the pipeline inventory relative to the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime shift confirmed (P24-P25): Average demand dropped to ~50 units/period, down from the mid-summer average of ~84 and the early summer peak of ~150. Significant inventory surplus exists.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016004 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a late-summer demand trough. The current date (2019/08/12) suggests a transition from summer clearance toward potential back-to-school demand, however, recent data shows a sustained low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 3 periods (P24-P26) is 57 units, significantly lower than the June peak (~150). Inventory levels are currently very high (278 on-hand + 51 in-transit = 329 units), which at current demand rates covers nearly 6 periods, exceeding the L+1 (5 period) requirement. No new orders are needed. L remains stable at 4 periods. \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are calculated using the last 5 periods (N=5, P22-P26) to capture the recent stabilization at lower levels (average ~68, std ~19). This prevents over-ordering while the system clears surplus inventory.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand stabilization: Average demand for P22-P26 is 67.8 units, reflecting a post-summer slowdown for this denim style compared to the June peak (avg ~142). High inventory surplus (300+ units) is currently being drawn down.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are in a late-summer/pre-autumn stabilization phase for this denim SKU. Demand over the last 4 periods (P24-P27) has averaged 65.5 units, which is a significant reduction from the early summer peak (~140). The inventory position is currently high (On-hand: 187), and we have 99 units in-transit (orders from P25, P26, and P27). Total pipeline inventory (On-hand + In-transit) is 286 units. Given the recent demand average of ~66, this inventory covers approximately 4.3 periods, which is close to the coverage required for a lead time of 4 (L+1 = 5 periods). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To avoid further overstocking while maintaining a safe service level during this low-demand regime, I will use a recent N=6 for demand (covering P22-P27, avg ~73) to capture the trend while providing a small buffer against the recent uptick in P27 (91).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late August (Period 29), a time typically associated with back-to-school demand for denim. Recent demand has stabilized after a mid-summer slump, with the last 5 periods (P24-P28) averaging approximately 64 units. Specifically, the last two periods showed 91 and 58 units. The 'late-summer demand' documented in carry-over insights is showing signs of a slight recovery or at least stabilization. On-hand inventory is 129, with 201 units in-transit (orders from P25-P28). The promised and actual lead time remains 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), targeting a high service level is preferred; however, to avoid the massive surplus experienced in July, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (64 units * (1+L) = 320) but rely on the backend's capping logic. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) captures the current stabilized demand regime and allows for a slight uptick if back-to-school trends begin.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand stabilization confirmed (P24-P28): Average demand is 64 units/period, down from the June peak but showing consistency as the season transitions towards autumn.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, transitioning into the autumn season. Demand has stabilized into a late-summer/early-autumn regime. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P24-P29) is ~61.3 units. While early summer saw peaks of 150+, the recent trend (P28: 58, P29: 48) suggests a steady baseline. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 84 units on hand and 225 units in-transit (from orders in P26, P27, P28, and P29), the pipeline is well-stocked for the 5-period horizon (L+1). I will use a 6-period window (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand level while accounting for recent variability, and a broader window for sigma_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock against autumn demand fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand transition: Average demand P24-P29 stabilized at ~61 units/period, down from summer peaks. Pipeline inventory is currently high relative to this demand level.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand has stabilized into an autumn regime. The average demand for the last seven periods (P24-P30) is 60.2 units per period, showing a significant drop from summer peaks (~140) and mid-summer levels (~90). Most recently, P28-P30 have shown very consistent demand (58, 48, 55). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 26 order in Period 30. There is currently 77 units on-hand and 210 units in-transit (from orders in P27, P28, P29, and P30). The total pipeline plus on-hand (287 units) covers nearly 5 periods of demand at the current rate (~60/period), which is appropriate for a 4-period lead time. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to capture this stabilized autumn demand level and use the same window for sigma_hat to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand P24-P30 is 60.2 units/period, down from summer peaks. This level appears consistent entering September.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for this high-waisted denim SKU has stabilized into an autumn regime following summer peaks. Over the last 8 periods (P24-P31), the average demand is 56.6 units, with the most recent three periods (P29-P31) showing a tight cluster around ~50 units (48, 55, 46). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 79, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 210, totaling 289 units. Given the target base stock is approximately (L+1) * mean_demand = 5 * 50 = 250 units, the current inventory position is sufficient but starting to align more closely with demand. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this stable autumn demand level while allowing for some historical context. The OR backend will likely order minimally or not at all this period as pipeline inventory covers upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand P24-P31 is 56.6 units/period, roughly 40% of the early summer peak. Demand in September (P30-P31) is stable around 50 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for current Period 33 (late September) continues to stabilize in a lower autumn regime. The average demand for the last five periods (P28-P32) is approximately 44.4 units, with the most recent sample at 35. This confirms a significant downtrend from the summer peak (avg ~142) and the mid-summer plateau (~84). The service level target is relatively low (80%) because the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1 ($4/$1), making excess inventory costly. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set parameters reflecting this lower demand regime to allow the current high on-hand (149) and pipeline (141) inventory to be gradually consumed, avoiding excessive holding costs while maintaining a modest safety stock for the current 40-50 unit demand level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at lower levels: average demand P28-P32 is 44.4 units/period, down significantly from the summer peak. Late September shows further softening (P32 demand = 35).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016004' (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a stable autumn demand phase. Over the last 6 periods (P28-P33), demand has fluctuated but averaged approximately 56 units/period (58, 48, 55, 46, 35, 73). While Period 33 saw a spike to 73, the broader trend since late August indicates a lower volume compared to summer peaks. Lead time is confirms stable at 4 periods (P29 order arrived in P33). Currently, on-hand inventory is 100 units and in-transit is 117 units (from orders in P30, P31, P32), totaling a pipeline of 217 units. Given an average demand of ~56, our current total stock covers nearly 4 periods of demand (56 * 4 = 224). To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for the recent volatility (P33 spike), I will use recent_N with N=6 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this specific autumn regime. No new order is likely needed this period as the pipeline is sufficient, but setting these parameters allows the OR engine to maintain the ideal base stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime shows periodic volatility: while the average for P28-P33 is ~56 units, outliers like P33 (73) and P32 (35) suggest increased variance compared to the stable late-summer period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in an autumn demand regime for this skinny denim SKU. Historical demand for the last 7 periods (P28-P34) shows an average of ~55.7 units/period (58, 48, 55, 46, 35, 73, 75). There is increased volatility recently (P33 and P34 are > 70 units), possibly due to early autumn shopping or promotional activities. Lead time remained stable at 4 periods throughout the history. On-hand inventory is 58. Pipeline inventory is 154 (orders from P31, P32, P34). Total coverage is 212 units. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for (4+1)=5 periods. My estimated demand for this window is ~280 units (56 * 5). With 212 units already available/coming, we are slightly under-stocked for the volatility. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures the current autumn baseline while accounting for the recent uptick. For sigma_hat, using recent_N=7 will capture the increased variance seen in the last two weeks (std dev is ~15 units/period vs previous ~8), helping the OR backend adjust the base stock to protect against stockouts during this volatile transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime shows increased volatility in late September/early October (P33-P34 demand > 70 compared to previous average ~50).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016004' (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in an autumn demand regime. Recent demand (P33-P35) has shown an uptick from the late-summer lows (~60) to a higher average of ~72 units/period. The current date is mid-October, where denim often sees stable or slightly increasing demand before the holiday peak. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 39 units, with 186 units in-transit (orders from P32-P35: 36, 0, 70, 80). The P32 order (36 units) arrives this period (P36), bringing expected on-hand to 75. Given the recent demand uptick, I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the last 3 periods (P33-P35) to capture this minor shift (N=3 reflects the most recent trend). sigma_hat will also be based on these 3 periods to account for the increased volatility (35 to 75) noted in recent history. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the projected ~72 units/period over the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand uptick confirmed (P33-P35): average demand increased to 71.7 units/period from the September average of ~55 units (+30%).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in an autumn demand uptick phase. Average demand from P33 to P36 is 68.75 units per period, which is higher than the September average of ~55. With on-hand inventory at 15 and 229 units in-transit, we need to maintain sufficient stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the one-period lookahead (L+1=5). Current pipeline (15 + 229 = 244) covers approximately 3.5 periods of demand at the recent rate of 68.75. To ensure service levels for the next 5-period window (estimated requirement ~344 units), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period uptick trend (N=4) to accurately capture the shift from the summer low. L is stable at 4 periods. Since demand volatility has increased recently (P32 was 35, P34 was 75), I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to allow the OR engine to buffer for this variance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand uptick confirmed (P33-P36): average demand increased to 68.75 units/period from the September average of ~55 units (~25% increase).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016004 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in an autumn demand uptick phase (P33-P37), with demand averaging 67.4 units/period, which is higher than the September average of ~50. Period 37 concluded with a stockout (on-hand = 0), as the order from Period 33 (0 units) left no arrival for Period 37. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high-waisted denim being a seasonal staple and the current demand trend showing stability between 60-75 units, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this established autumn regime (avg ~67.4). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the moderate volatility seen in October. This will trigger a reorder to replenish the empty on-hand inventory and cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand uptick stabilized (P33-P37): average demand is 67.4 units/period, compared to the September average of ~55 (+22%). Stockout occurred in P37 due to a zero-order gap in P33.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November. Observed demand for the last 6 periods (P33-P38) has stabilized around an average of 66 units, which is a consistent uptick from the September average of ~55. Period 38 demand was 59 units. Although Period 37 saw a stockout due to a previous ordering gap, inventories are now recovering with the arrival of the Period 34 order. The current on-hand inventory is 11, and there is a healthy pipeline of 280 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this autumn demand level (Avg ~66 per period) while maintaining sigma_hat on the same window to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand P33-P38 is 66.0 units/period, roughly 20% higher than the September baseline. Inventory recovery is underway with a 280-unit pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-November. Historically, denim demand for this item saw a significant spike in early spring (April) and a secondary summer peak (June). Recent demand (P33-P39) has stabilized at a higher level (average ~63 units) compared to the September baseline (average ~50 units). However, the most recent period (P39) showed a dip to 43 units. We are currently in a transition period towards winter. Given the current on-hand inventory of 48 and a substantial pipeline of 252 units (totaling 300 units), we are well-covered for the next 4-5 periods if demand stays at current levels (~60/period). Lead time results remain consistently 4. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the autumn regime (P33-P39) while maintaining the default lead time. The goal is to avoid over-ordering as we enter late Q4 where demand might soften for this specific 'washed' denim style before any potential holiday or New Year shifts.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has stabilized into a late-autumn regime. After a brief uptick in early October (P33-P37 avg ~67), the last three periods (P38-P40) show a slowdown with an average demand of 50.33 units. Current inventory status: 78 units on-hand and 207 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, P40). The order from P37 should arrive in Period 41. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high inventory-to-demand ratio and the shift to a lower demand profile (~50 units/week), I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the broader autumn trend (~57 units/week) while allowing the OR backend to adjust for the recent softening. This ensures we don't over-order as we move deeper into November.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand softening: demand decreased from an early-October peak (avg ~68) to a November average of ~50 (Periods 38-40), indicating a late-season slowdown.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has softened as we approach late November, with the mean dropping from the early October peak of ~68 units to a November average (P38-P41) of approximately 48 units. Current on-hand inventory is 116 units, and there is a pipeline of 168 units (total 284 units). With an estimated lead time of 4 periods and a maintenance-level demand of ~48 units, the 'on-hand + pipeline' position covers approximately 5.9 periods of supply. Given the current softening trend and the inventory position relative to the remaining weeks in the year, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the November demand baseline of ~48 units/period. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $558.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a significant demand spike to 143 units, which is much higher than the November average (~50). This likely corresponds to the 'Black Friday' retail peak. Looking ahead, we are in early December (Period 43, Date 2019/12/02). Historical patterns and general retail knowledge suggest demand may remain elevated due to holiday shopping before tapering off toward year-end. The current on-hand inventory is low (14), though there is a substantial pipeline of 127 units. Specifically, orders from P39 (52 units), P40 (34 units), and P41 (41 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 43, 44, and 45 respectively (given a stable 4-period lead time). Because of the recent volatility (143 units following a string of ~50s), I am using a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 (P38-P42) to capture the trend change without over-indexing on the single highest spike, while using a wider window (N=10) for sigma_hat to account for this increased volatility in the safety stock calculation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand increased to 143 units (nearly 3x the previous 4-week average), consistent with Black Friday/Cyber Monday seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the post-holiday period (early December). Period 42 saw a major spike (143 units) due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, but Period 43 immediately returned to a more normal level (54 units). The 'carry_over_insight' correctly identified this spike. For Period 44, I expect demand to remain higher than the November baseline but lower than the holiday peak as we enter the pre-Christmas shopping window. Using the last 6 periods for mu_hat (N=6, covering P38-P43) provides an average of 65 units/period, which balances the November lows with the recent holiday activity. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With only 12 units on-hand and 190 in transit (orders from P40, P41, P43), the OR engine needs to monitor if the P40 order (34 units) arrives this period to avoid a near-term stockout if December demand accelerates.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) confirmed at Period 42 (143 units), followed by a return to baseline in Period 43 (54 units). Expected December demand stabilized around 60-70 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the post-holiday December period. Period 42 saw a significant Black Friday spike (143 units), but demand has since returned to a baseline level of approximately 44 units (average of P43-P44). Historical data from similar post-peak transitions and the current date suggest a stable but moderate demand regime. Current on-hand inventory is low (12), but the pipeline is substantial (285), with arrivals expected from orders placed in P41 (41 units) and P43 (115 units). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals. Given we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47), the goal is to maintain a target service level while avoiding excessive end-of-game inventory. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the post-holiday baseline (avg demand ~68 but heavily skewed by P42, more recent average is ~44). This will help the OR backend right-size the inventory without over-reacting to the P42 spike.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization: Average demand P43-P44 has returned to ~44 units/period following the Period 42 spike (143).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the pre-Christmas/Holiday season (Period 46, Dec 23). Historical demand for the last three non-spike periods (P43-P45) averaged 50.7 units. We saw a major spike in P42 (143 units) for Black Friday. While P45 showed a slight increase to 64 units, the product is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). There is a significant pipeline of 384 units, with the P43 order (115 units) expected to arrive in P47 (next period). Given we are at Period 46 of 47, this is the final decision period. The objective is to cover the remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. I will set mu_hat based on the recent post-holiday average (N=3) to catch the baseline demand of ~50-60 units. Lead time L is stable at 4 periods. Since this is the final period, the OR backend will calculate the final order based on the base stock minus the existing 384 units in transit.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has normalized following the Period 42 holiday spike. Current demand for Periods 43-46 averages 49.5 units/period (54, 34, 64, 46), which is consistent with the post-holiday stabilization noted in Period 45. The stockout in Period 46 occurred because the Period 42 order was '0', creating a gap in the logic of continuous supply despite the 4-period lead time. However, large orders were placed in Period 43 (115), Period 44 (129), and Period 45 (140), totaling 384 units in-transit. The Period 43 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 47 resolution phase (visible in P48). Given the high pipeline relative to a weekly demand of ~50, I am setting the order to 0 (via the backend's capped policy) by using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stabilized post-holiday demand mean (~50) and variance. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization confirmed (P43-P46): average demand is 49.5 units/period, roughly 35% of the holiday peak, returning to late-autumn baseline levels.
