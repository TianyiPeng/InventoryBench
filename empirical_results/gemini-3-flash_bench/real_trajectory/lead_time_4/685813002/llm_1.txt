World knowledge suggests February in the Northern Hemisphere is late winter, typically seeing high demand for sweatshirts/fleece-lined items as consumers prepare for lingering cold and early spring. Historical data provided (64, 36, 45, 52, 56) shows a mean weekly demand of approximately 50.6 units. The product description ('Soft brushed inside') confirms its seasonal relevance for February. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 6 (after Period 5 conclude). To avoid stockouts until then, I need to cover demand for Periods 1 through 5 (L+1 = 5 periods). Expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 253 units (50.6 * 5). Currently, on-hand and in-transit are both 0. I will order 253 units to build the initial pipeline and satisfy the expected demand until the shipment arrives.",

The last four periods (P5-P8) demand figures are 37, 28, 35, 55 (Average: 38.75). The spike to 55 in Period 8 might be a variance fluctuation or related to a late cold snap/Easter promotion, but the underlying trend remains significantly lower than the P1-P3 levels (~60 units). c) Lead Time: Confirmed at 4 periods (P4 arrived at P8).

We are currently in late May (Period 15), entering the warmer summer season in the Northern Hemisphere, which explains the observed demand drop from ~50 to ~30-35 units since Period 4. Analysis of the last 10 periods (P5-P14) shows an average demand of approximately 33.8 units per period, while the most recent 3 periods (P12-P14) averaged 28 units. A conservative forecast of 32 units/period is appropriate. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods (Periods 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19).

Since the pipeline (175) exceeds the target requirement (160) and the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0), it is optimal to avoid overstocking, especially as we head further into the off-season for sweatshirts.

  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is a seasonal product for cold weather. On P42 (Date: 2019/11/25), we observed a significant demand spike to 212 units, coinciding with Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. This is a massive jump from the previous 5-week average of ~80 units. Historically, sweatshirt demand remains high through December. Based on previous behavior, a lead time of 4 periods means orders placed now (P43) will arrive in P47. Our current position: On-hand (55) + In-transit (225) = 280 units total pipeline. The in-transit units are expected as follows: P43 (50), P44 (50), P45 (50), P46 (75). Given the recent demand surge, even if demand stabilizes at a post-peak average of ~100-120 units, we are at risk of a stockout between P43-P46 because the 55 on-hand + 50 arrival won't cover another 212-unit week. However, since the game ends at P47 and we have 225 in-transit already plus 55 on-hand (Total 280), and only 4 demand periods remaining (P43, P44, P45, P46), we must balance the holiday peak with the risk of high holding costs at the end of the simulation. Assuming demand averages ~100 over the final 4 weeks (400 units total), we are currently short ~120 units. I will order 125 units to ensure availability for the holiday season while accounting for the recent spike.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Significant demand spike observed in Period 42: Demand reached 212 units (+167% vs previous 5-week average), coinciding with late November retail peaks (Black Friday). Forecast for December adjusted upwards to account for sustained holiday demand.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is highly seasonal. Period 42 saw a massive demand spike of 212 units (Black Friday), followed by 72 units in Period 43. December demand for sweatshirts typically remains elevated due to holiday shopping and cold weather. While the baseline Autumn mean was ~80, the holiday effect suggests we should prepare for a wider range (80-120) until the end of the year. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand is low at 33. The pipeline (In-transit) is 300 units, consisting of orders from P40 (50), P41 (50), P42 (75), and P43 (125). These will arrive in P44, P45, P46, and P47 respectively. Total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 333 units. This must cover demand for P44, P45, P46, and P47. At an estimated holiday mean of ~100 units/period, we need approximately 400 units to avoid stockouts through the end of the game (which ends at Period 47). Since the game ends at P47 and we have a 4-period lead time, any order placed now (P44) would only arrive AFTER the game ends (at the start of P49 decision phase). Therefore, additional ordering is impossible to fulfill within the game horizon. However, to maintain a safe terminal stock position or follow standard replenishment logic, I will place a conservative order to bridge the gap to the 400-unit target.",

Period 44 demand was 105, which resulted in a stockout (0 on-hand). The Autumn/Winter base demand is ~80 units, but December demand is elevated due to Christmas and cold weather. Current on-hand is 0. In-transit consists of orders from P41 (50), P42 (75), P43 (125), and P44 (67). With a 4-period lead time, P41 (50 units) arrives in the resolution phase of P45, P42 arrives in P46, P43 in P47, and P44 in P48. Since the game ends around Period 47/48, I need to ensure that the demand for the remaining periods is covered. My current pipeline (317 units) covers roughly 3 periods of 100-unit demand.

Forecasting demand for the next 5 periods (L+1): P46-P47 (post-Christmas/Boxing Day sales) and P48-P50 (January clearance/winter demand). I expect demand to remain high but potentially taper slightly post-holidays, likely averaging 80-90 units. Total expected demand for P46-P50 is ~425 units (85 units * 5).

Current date is December 30, which marks the transition from the peak holiday gift-giving season into the post-holiday January period. Demand analysis: P42 (Black Friday week) saw 212 units. P43-P45 averaged 96.3 units during the December holiday rush. P46 (Christmas week) saw a significant drop to 46 units, which is consistent with the conclusion of the holiday peak. Historically (P1-P4, Feb/Mar), demand was ~50-60 units. I anticipate a similar 'post-holiday/early spring' regime to begin now, settling around 50-60 units per period. Inventory assessment: On-hand is low (29). In-transit pipeline: 125 (P43, due P47), 67 (P44, due P48), 80 (P45, due P49), 80 (P46, due P50). Total pipeline = 352 units. Expected demand for lead-time + current period (L+1 = 5 periods) is roughly 250-300 units (5 * ~55 units).
