Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averages ~106.6 units/period (68, 109, 126, 114, 116). Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since my current on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, I must order enough to cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Estimating demand at ~115 units per period (the most recent trend), I need 575 units (115 * 5).

Based on historical data, I estimate an average weekly demand of approximately 115-120 units.

Since P1, demand has been higher: 147, 178, 141, 129 (Avg: 148.75). However, there is a clear decelerating trend over the last three periods (178 -> 141 -> 129), suggesting the late winter peak is fading as spring (mid-March) approaches. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4. Order P1 (580 units) was placed at the start of P1. Per 'Critical Timing Example', a lead time of 4 means it should arrive during P(1+4)=P5 arrival resolution and be visible in the P5 conclude message. Thus, I expect 580 units to arrive AFTER my current decision. d) Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 990 (P1: 580, P2: 140, P3: 220, P4: 50). e) Order Logic: I am targeting a pipeline that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using a defensive forecast of ~135 units/period (reflecting the recent slowdown), I need 135 * 5 = 675 units total. Current pipeline is 990 units.

Current demand in late August (P26-P29) has shown a significant recovery from the summer trough (5-15 units) to an average of ~58 units, although P28 and P29 saw a slight dip (56 and 54) following a spike of 79 in P27. Given the lead time of 4 periods, orders placed now (P30) will arrive in P34 (late September/early October), which is traditionally a peak period for tights as cooler weather sets in. I expect demand to climb towards the 130-150 range throughout September. Current inventory position: On-hand = 115. In-transit = 560 (410 from P28, 150 from P29). Total Pipeline = 675.

  "rationale": "The product is 30 denier tights, a seasonal staple for colder weather. We are now in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), entering the peak of winter. Historical data from P33 onwards shows a stable high-demand regime averaging approx. 308 units/week (last 3 periods: 325, 290, 355). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Orders are arriving reliably. Currently, On-hand is 361. The in-transit pipeline (ordered P39-P42) consists of: P39 (300), P40 (250), P41 (250), and P42 (250), totaling 1050 units. To satisfy demand for the lead time + current period (L+1 = 5 periods), we need to cover demand until P47 (the end of the game). Total demand required for P43-P47 (5 periods) at an average of 320/week is 1600 units. Total current supply (On-hand 361 + In-transit 1050) is 1411 units. We need roughly 190 more units to safely cover through the end of the game (P47). An order of 190 units ensures we meet demand without incurring excessive holding costs as the game concludes.",

Period 44 (2019/12/9) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', a seasonal item that peaks in autumn/winter and hits a trough in summer. We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), approaching the end of the simulation in Period 47. Historical data shows demand remained high (~300 units/week) through October and November, but Period 43 saw a significant drop to 197 units. Given the seasonality of tights, demand typically softens as winter progresses (past the initial buying surge) and then drops significantly as spring approaches. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P44, P45, P46, P47), we must avoid ending with excess inventory due to the high holding cost ($1/unit). Order Lead Time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (P44) will arrive in Period P48 resolution (visible in P49), which is AFTER the game ends. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur costs and generate no revenue. Our current inventory pipeline (On-hand: 464 + In-transit: 940 = 1404 units) is already more than sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods, even if demand stayed at 300/week (total 1200 needed). Since the game ends at the conclusion of P47 and arrivals happen after the decision phase, we should not place any more orders.",

Any order placed in Period 45 would arrive during Period 49 (45 + 4), which is after the game concludes. Therefore, ordering more stock is unproductive as it cannot be sold and would only incur holding costs if it were to arrive, though in this mechanism, it simply won't arrive within the scoring window. On-hand inventory is currently 395 units, and in-transit inventory from previous orders (Periods 41, 42, 43) totals 690 units (250 + 250 + 190). These will arrive in Periods 45, 46, and 47 respectively.

{
  "rationale": "We are in Period 46 of 47. The game concludes in one period. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods (which has been consistently accurate at 4 periods), any order placed in Period 46 will not arrive until Period 50, which is well past the game's end at Period 47. Therefore, the priority is to maximize sales from existing inventory while minimizing holding costs for the final period. In Period 45, we saw a massive demand spike to 475 units (likely related to pre-Christmas/Winter shopping), leaving 170 units on hand. Scheduled arrivals for Period 46 resolution (ordered in Period 42) is 250 units. Total available inventory for Period 46 resolution and Period 47 is: 170 (on-hand) + 250 (P46 arrival) + 190 (ordered P43, arriving P47 resolution) = 610 units. Since ordering now has no impact on game revenue and would only potential incur costs if the game logic somehow extended, I will place 0 orders, consistent with the end-of-game strategy triggered in Period 44.",

According to the game mechanics, any order placed now (in the Period 47 decision phase) would only arrive in Period 51 (47 + 4), which is past the game's conclusion.
