Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the Mariette Blazer. Historical data for the last 5 weeks shows a mean demand of 173.4 units (161, 145, 179, 196, 186). The 'Womens Tailoring' category and 'Blazer' product type suggest stable to increasing demand as we move into the spring corporate/event season. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the demand coverage should span 5 periods (L+1). My target base stock should be approximately 173.4 * 5 = 867 units, plus a safety stock buffer. I will use the 'default' method for L (relying on the promised 4 periods) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using all 5 available historical samples (N=5) to capture the most recent demand level.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's blazer ('Mariette Blazer'), which is typically a staple item but can see early spring demand spikes. Initial demand in Period 1 was 227 units, which is higher than the historical samples (145-196 range, mean=173.4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 207 units in transit from Period 1. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4, we expect this first shipment to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). We need to place an order now to cover demand for Period 2 through L+1 (Period 6). Given the robust first-period demand, I will use the recent mean of all 6 available samples (the 5 historical plus P1) to set mu_hat, ensuring we account for the slightly higher recent observation without overreacting to a single data point.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25) managing SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer). The promised lead time is 4 periods. The history shows orders placed in Period 1 (207 units) and Period 2 (230 units), totaling 437 units in-transit. No arrivals have occurred yet, which is expected as the lead time is 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have missed demand in Periods 1 (227) and 2 (284) due to starting with 0 stock. Historical demand samples (last 5) show a mean of 173.4. However, Period 1 demand was 227 and Period 2 was 284, indicating a significant upward trend (~30-60% increase over pre-game samples). This is likely driven by seasonal demand for 'Womens Tailoring' as spring approaches. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to reflect this recent surge in demand, and 'default' for lead time and sigma_hat since there's no evidence yet to deviate from defaults.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). This is a Women's Blazer (Mariette Blazer), which typically sees higher demand in early spring as customers update their work/social wardrobes. The historical demand samples (161, 145, 179, 196, 186) show a mean of ~173. Recent observed demand during the game (P1: 227, P2: 284, P3: 198) shows a significantly higher mean of ~236. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had back-to-back periods of zero sales despite high demand, resulting in lost profits. The promised lead time is 4. The order from Period 1 (207 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at start of P6). We have 769 units in transit. Since we have only 5 historical samples plus 3 game periods, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand regime. mu_hat will be set to (1+L) * mean_demand, and sigma_hat will be calculated similarly. L is set to default (4) as we have no evidence yet that the lead time is deviating from the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Historical mean ~173 increased to ~236 (+36%) in the first 3 game periods (Feb-early March), likely due to seasonal demand for spring tailoring.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has seen demand average ~231 units over the first four periods, significantly higher than the initial historical mean of ~171. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 1,053 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, it is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. According to the tracking rules, this arrival will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals so far is expected. To ensure we have enough stock to meet demand during the review + lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), and given the consistent demand shift observed since Feb 11th, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=4) and keep the lead time at the default promised value while monitoring for the first arrival next period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a women's blazer, which is experiencing high 'Spring tailoring' demand. Demand history: 227, 284, 198, 214, 215. The mean for these 5 periods is 227.6, which is significantly higher (+31.5%) than the pre-game mean (~173). Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5. On-hand is 0, and in-transit is 1085 (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). We need to maintain a high base stock to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated seasonal regime. The OR backend uses a service level of approximately 95% (q = 19/20 = 0.95), which is appropriate for this high-margin item.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's blazer, which is seeing seasonal demand for spring tailoring. Historical mean from seed data was ~173, but in-game demand (Periods 1-6) has averaged ~225.5. The promised lead time (L=4) has been confirmed by two consecutive deliveries (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Currently, we have 15 units on-hand and 1031 in-transit (P3, P4, P5, P6 orders). While demand remains significantly higher than the pre-game history, the last 4 periods (P3-P6) show relative stability with a mean of ~210.5. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this stable in-game demand pattern for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for L as the lead time is consistently matching the promise of 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees strong demand in Spring. Observed demand for the last 7 periods (227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215, 186) averages 219.8 units per period. The Carry-over Insight noted a shift from 173 to ~236, but the most recent three periods (P5-P7) show a slight cooling to an average of 205. Given we are in early April, demand is likely to remain stable or slightly decrease as the peak spring tailoring season passes. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 737 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), which covers the next 4 periods of demand (4 * ~205 = 820). On-hand is 161. Pipeline + On-hand = 898, which is roughly 4.1 periods of supply. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current elevated demand regime compared to the pre-game history, while allowing for the slight recent stabilization. Method 'calculate' for L will use the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are managing the 'Mariette Blazer', a spring tailoring item. The demand over the first 8 periods has averaged ~223.5 units per week, which is significantly higher than the pre-game historical mean of ~173. Recent demand in Period 8 spiked to 249, suggesting continued strength as we move deeper into spring. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been perfectly consistent (observed arrivals for orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived with exactly 4 periods lead time). Current on-hand is 196, and pipeline inventory is 725 (orders from P5-P8). Using the promised lead time of 4 is reliable. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 8-period mean is 223.5; multiplying by (1+L) = 5 gives 1117.5. Given the slight upward trend/volatility (P8=249), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this active season regime while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock (sigma_hat) based on the variance of these 8 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is confirmed stable at exactly 4 periods based on 4 consecutive arrivals (P1-P4 orders). Demand regime remains elevated at ~224 avg per week for the spring season compared to initial historical levels of 173.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are in the peak spring season for the 'Mariette Blazer'. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on 5 consecutive arrivals (P1-P5). Demand remains in an elevated regime compared to the initial 2018/early 2019 samples; the average demand since Period 1 is approximately 218 units, while the last 3 periods show a slight cooling or fluctuation (avg 204). Given the upcoming potential for mid-to-late spring demand spikes, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 game periods (N=9) to capture the current seasonal elevation while smoothing out the recent lower reading in Period 9. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=9 to reflect the current variability. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019/4/22). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees peak demand during the spring tailoring season (Feb-April). Reviewing recent demand data: P8 (249), P9 (178), and P10 (130). There is a clear downward trend in the last two periods, suggesting the spring peak is tapering off. The average demand over the last 10 game periods is approximately 199.6, but the most recent 3-period average is 185.6. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (L=4). Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 303, In-transit: 779), reflecting orders placed during higher demand expectations. To avoid overstocking as the season cools, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the last 5 weeks: 215, 186, 249, 178, 130), which yields a weekly mean of 191.6, helping to gradually lower the base stock. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to capture the overall volatility of the game period while excluding the much lower pre-game historical variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering: Demand peaked in early April (P8) and has declined for two consecutive periods (P9-P10), suggesting the end of the spring tailoring surge.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019/4/29). Historical lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. The 'Mariette Blazer' is transitioning out of the spring peak season. Demand has declined for three consecutive weeks (P9: 178, P10: 130, P11: 127), dropping from a seasonal average of ~220 units to ~145 units recently. Based on this confirmed downward trend, I am setting N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the post-peak regime. The current pipeline (770 units) is high relative to this new demand level, so choosing recent_N (N=3) will allow the OR engine to reduce orders and prevent excessive holding costs as seasonality fades.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: Avg demand has dropped from ~220 to ~145 units/week over the last 3 periods (P9-P11), a 34% decrease from the spring tailoring peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Demand for the Mariette Blazer spiked during the spring tailoring season (Feb-mid April) but has stabilized at a lower level since late April. Observations from Period 9 to Period 12 show demand values of 178, 130, 127, and 191 (mean of ~156), which is significantly lower than the peak spring average of ~224 but slightly higher than the pre-surge historical mean of 173. The Period 12 demand (191) suggests a minor bounce, but the overall trend is downward compared to April. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at exactly 4 periods. With 295 units on hand and 498 in transit, there is substantial inventory to cover the upcoming 5 periods (L+1) at the current demand rate (~156 * 5 = 780). I will use a recent window (N=4) to capture this post-peak demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations while sticking to the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (mid-May). The product is the Mariette Blazer, a women's tailoring item. Historical demand showed a peak in early April (P8: 249 units) during the spring season, followed by a sustained drop. Over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged approximately 157 units (178, 130, 127, 191, 160), which is significantly lower than the ~224 units seen during the peak. This suggests we are now in a 'post-peak' or 'regular' demand regime for late spring/early summer. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (P9 order arrived in P13). There is currently high on-hand inventory (410) and a significant amount in-transit (334). Given the lower demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this lower average (~157 * 5 = 785) to avoid over-ordering while maintaining enough stock to cover the lead time + current period (L+1=5) as demand transitions out of the peak tail. I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current period's lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: Avg demand for Mariette Blazer settled around 155-160 units/week (P9-P13) after the early-April spring tailoring peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's blazer, which saw a demand spike during the spring tailoring season (Feb-April) and has now transitioned into a stable late-spring/early-summer regime. Demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) has averaged approximately 164 units per week, with recent volatility (P12-P14 demand: 191, 160, 196). Lead time is verified as stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is high at 408 units, and with 287 units in-transit (expected arrivals of 29, 0, 111, 147 units over the next 4 periods), we are well-stocked. To prevent over-ordering as we move further into the warmer months, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the post-peak average demand while using recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to account for recent weekly fluctuations. The OR backend will see the high pipeline inventory and likely output a small order, which is appropriate given the high ending on-hand inventory (408).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27th, and the Mariette Blazer is settling into a post-spring tailoring demand regime. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P10-P15) shows average weekly demand has stabilized around 159 units, significantly lower than the April peak. Specifically, the last two weeks showed demand of 196 (P14) and 143 (P15). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 294 units with 471 units in-transit. To avoid overstocking as the peak season ends, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 samples to capture the lower post-peak mean (~159 * 5 = 795). I will use the last 6 samples for sigma_hat as well to reflect current volatility. This approach helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock for the current demand level while accounting for the significant in-transit pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the Mariette Blazer is in a stable post-spring demand regime. Over the last 8 periods (P9-P16), demand has averaged 161.6 units per week with a moderate standard deviation (approx 36). The zero arrival in Period 16 is consistent with the order placed in Period 12 being 0 units, confirming the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. While total pipeline inventory (606) + on-hand (126) is high relative to current weekly demand, the OR engine needs accurate parameters to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal tail. I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand regime (avg ~162) and calculate the lead time based on the consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P9-P16) stabilized at avg 162 units/week following the spring tailoring surge. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is in a post-peak seasonal phase. The current date is June 10, entering the early summer period. In Period 17, demand dropped to 118 units, below the recent post-peak average of ~162. Analysis of the history from Period 12 onwards shows a stable demand regime averaging 157 units (191, 160, 196, 143, 168, 118). Since the last 6 periods show consistent behavior after the April surge, I will use N=6 for demand forecasting. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 17 conclusion where the P13 order arrived). Note: The Period 12 order (amount 0) was 'skipped' in the arrivals logic but the P13 order arrived exactly 4 periods later, confirming the L=4 consistency. I will use recent_N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-spring demand level and its associated volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a stable post-peak demand regime. Since Period 9 (early April), weekly demand has normalized following the spring tailoring surge. Over the last 10 periods (P9-P18), the average demand is 155.0 units per week. The most recent demand (P18) was 139, following 118 in P17, indicating that demand hasn't significantly drifted from this 155-160 level. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P13 order arrived in P17, P14 order arrived in P18). Notably, the order from Period 12 (value: 0 units) correctly resulted in 0 arrivals in Period 16, confirming no unexpected delays or losses. I am setting L to the prometed 4 periods. For mu_hat, I am using N=10 to capture the current stable regime (P9-P18), which yields an average of ~155 per week, scaled by (1+L). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to reflect the volatility seen in this stabilized period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Analysis of recent demand (P11-P19) shows that the 'Mariette Blazer' has entered a stable post-spring demand regime. The average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 144 units per week, with a notable decline in the last three periods (118, 139, 122). The spring peak found in early April has clearly passed. On-hand inventory is 218 units, with 537 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. The in-transit pipeline includes the order from P16 (135 units), which should arrive in the current Period 20 (visible next period). I am setting mu_hat to reflect the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture this lower, post-peak mean (approx 145-150 units per week), and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility. This will prevent over-ordering as the product enters the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P11-P19) has consistently averaged ~144 units/week, significantly lower than the P1-P9 spring peak avg (~213).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. The 'Mariette Blazer' is entering the mid-summer period. Demand has significantly decelerated over the last few periods (P18-P20: 139, 122, 73), with P20 showing a notably low demand of 73 units. The Carry-over Insight from Period 20 established a post-peak average of ~144 units/week, but the most recent 3-week average is even lower at ~111 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (280) plus in-transit (498) totals 778 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand. To prevent overstocking during this lower-demand summer phase, I am reducing mu_hat by using recent_N (N=6) to capture the cooling demand more accurately than the long-term average, while moving to the calculated lead time to reflect the proven 4-period stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration continues into July: 3-period average (P18-P20) dropped to ~111 units compared to the previous post-peak average of 144.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th. The Mariette Blazer is seeing a clear downward demand trend as we move further into mid-summer. The last four periods (P18-P21) have recorded demand values of 139, 122, 73, and 116, resulting in a 4-period average of approximately 112.5 units/week. This is a significant drop from the spring/early summer average of ~144. Inventory levels are currently high (338 on-hand + 324 in-transit), totaling 662 units, which is roughly 6 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and declining seasonal demand for Blazers (tailoring) in July, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this lower regime and minimize further accumulation of holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand deceleration confirmed: Demand for Blazers dropped significantly in late June/early July (P20-P21), with the 4-period average (P18-P21) falling to ~113 units/week, down ~22% from the previous post-peak average of 144.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a summer deceleration phase, consistent with typical retail seasonality for tailoring. Over the last four periods (P19-P22), demand has averaged 107.75 units (122, 73, 116, 120), significantly lower than the post-spring average of ~144 and much lower than the spring peak of ~213. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent low-demand regime (107.75 * 5 = 538.75). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of P18's order in P22. We currently have 352 units on hand and 194 in transit (546 total units), which nearly matches our base stock requirement for this low-demand phase. The OR backend will likely order a minimal amount to maintain this level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1954.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a summer demand slump. The demand from P20 to P23 has stabilized at a lower level with a 4-period average of approximately 107 units per week (73, 116, 120, 120). This represents a significant sustained decrease from the spring average (~213) and the early summer average (~144). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 326 units on-hand and 179 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 505), and current demand around 107/week, we have roughly 4.7 weeks of coverage. Since the lead time is 4 periods and we review every period, a target of (L+1) = 5 weeks is appropriate. Given the holding cost of $1/unit and a profit of $19/unit, the OR backend logic will target a high service level, but current stock levels are nearly sufficient for the immediate lead time horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this low summer demand regime while maintaining a standard 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been stable.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor confirmed (P20-P23): Demand for tailored blazers has stabilized at a lower average of ~107 units/week, down from the previous post-peak average of ~144.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is in a low-demand summer period. Demand for the last 5 periods (P20-P24) has been 73, 116, 120, 120, 63, averaging ~98 units/week. This confirms the summer demand floor identified in Carry-over Insights (Period 24). The inventory position is currently high (on-hand: 359, in-transit: 199, total pipeline: 558). Based on a 5-week coverage requirement (L+1=5), and an average demand of ~98, the target inventory is roughly 490 units. Since current pipeline (558) exceeds this, the OR backend will likely minimize new orders. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this current summer floor (approx 98 units/week * 5 periods = 490). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrivals.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August. Demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a summer floor, with an average of approximately 104 units/week over the last 6 periods (P20-P25: 73, 116, 120, 120, 63, 94). The spring tailoring peak has long passed, and we are now in a low-demand summer regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, with the exception of the Period 12 order (observed in P16 conclude as arrived=0, though Period 12 order was actually 0 units) and the current observation for P25 where the Period 21 order (0 units) correctly resulted in arrived=0. On-hand inventory is 265 units, and in-transit is 237 units (from P22-P25: 4+79+116+38=237). Total pipeline (502) is quite high relative to recent demand (~104/week). I will use recent_N=6 to reflect this current summer demand regime and set L to calculate to stay adaptive to lead time trends.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019-08-12). Historical data and carry-over insights show a significant demand drop during the summer months (July/August), with a 'summer floor' confirmed at approximately 107 units/week. However, Period 26 showed a sudden uptick to 146 units, which may signal a pre-autumn recovery as customers transition back to 'dressed' apparel (blazers) for the end of summer or early work season. The shipment from Period 21 (0 units ordered) resulted in no arrival in Period 25 as expected, and the small order from Period 22 arrived in Period 26. We are currently leaning on in-transit stock from later July (P23-P25) and early August. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the slight uptick in demand at P26 (146 units), I will use a recent_N window (N=5) to capture the summer floor while remaining responsive to this potential recovery, balancing the risk of stockouts against the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $19 profit).

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Potential demand recovery observed in August (P26: 146 units), interrupting the summer floor of ~107 units/week. Monitoring if this signals a sustained transition to autumn demand levels.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand spiked sharply to 301 units, following a previous increase to 146 in Period 26. This confirms a transition out of the summer lull (~107 units/week) into a pre-autumn/back-to-office demand regime for tailored blazers. The average demand of the last two periods (P26-P27) is ~224 units, reflecting a significant regime shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we experienced a stockout in P27. The Period 21 order (0 units) caused a lack of arrivals in Period 25, while the Period 12 order (0 units) was successfully bypassed earlier in the cycle. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P23 order arrived in P27). To respond to this surge and prevent further stockouts, I am increasing mu_hat using the last 2 periods as the basis for the new demand level and setting sigma_hat based on the recent volatility of this transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime shift confirmed: Demand surged from summer floor (~107) to avg 224 units/week (P26-P27), a >100% increase, likely driven by late August back-to-office tailoring seasonally.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (Period 29), and a significant demand surge is evident, likely driven by back-to-office/autumn tailoring seasonality. Demand jumped from a summer floor of ~107 units to over 250 units on average (P27: 301, P28: 251). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 654 units in-transit. The order from Period 25 (ordered 38) appears lost or significantly delayed, as it should have arrived in Period 29's arrival phase (which we will only see in Period 30's conclude message), but looking at Period 26-28, lead times for P22, P23, and P24 were stable at 4. The order from P25 is small (38), so the primary concern is stocking for the new autumn regime (~275 avg weekly). To capture this shift while ignoring the low summer samples, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to focus on the surge (P26-P28), which averages ~233 units/week. Including the high demand from P27/P28 will correctly pivot the OR backend to a higher base stock. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with the regime shift. Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as the 4-period window is historically stable despite the P25 uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Demand increased from ~107 units/week to ~275 units/week in late August (P27-P28), matching seasonal expectations for women's tailoring.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a significant autumn surge (late August/early September), likely driven by back-to-office and back-to-school demand. In the last three periods (P27-P29), demand has averaged 261 units/week (301, 251, 231), which is a 140%+ increase from the summer floor of ~107 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period, leading to substantial lost sales. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P29 saw the P25 order arrive). With L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (Period 30 through Period 34). I will set mu_hat using the recent 3-period average of 261 to capture this high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat reflects 5 * 261 = 1305. sigma_hat will also be set based on these recent high-volatility periods to provide a sufficient safety buffer during this stockout phase.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a significant autumn demand surge (Back-to-Office/Seasonality). Demand has averaged ~296 units/week over the last 4 periods (P27: 301, P28: 251, P29: 231, P30: 357), which is a clear regime shift from the summer floor of ~107. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P26 order arrived P30). Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts for the past 4 periods due to the rapid demand increase. To capture this high-demand regime and recover service levels while the OR backend uses a capped policy, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the 296 unit average. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility during this surge. The L parameter remains at default (4) as lead times are currently consistent.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at high levels: Avg demand P27-P30 is ~296 units/week, exceeding the spring peak of ~213.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently experiencing a strong autumn demand surge. Demand over the last five periods (P27-P31) has averaged 293.6 units (301, 251, 231, 357, 328), which is significantly higher than both the spring peak and the summer floor. The system is currently out of stock due to this rapid increase, leading to lost sales. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address the current stockout and capture the elevated seasonal demand, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the autumn regime, and sigma_hat also using N=5 to reflect the current high volatility. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed stable 4-period history.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized in a high-demand autumn regime. Recent demand (P27-P32) has been 301, 251, 231, 357, 328, and 341 units, averaging approximately 301.5 units per week. This is significantly higher than the spring peak (~213) and summer floor (~107), aligning with seasonal back-to-office tailoring trends for late September. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P28 order in P32. Currently, inventory is very low (35 on-hand) relative to demand, but a large pipeline (1285 units) is in transit from recent aggressive ordering. To sustain the current demand level while avoiding excessive over-ordering as we move deeper into autumn, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) of this regime (average ~301) and use recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time demand (+1 review period) based on the most current and sustained demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P27-P32) confirmed stable at avg ~301 units/week, significantly exceeding the spring peak (~213).

Daily Reward (R_t): $8284.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has experienced a significant and sustained autumn surge, with the most recent demand in Period 33 spiking to 612 units. This spike coincides with late September, likely driven by a combination of peak seasonal office-wear demand and potentially a calendar event. Over the last 7 periods (P27-P33), demand has averaged 346 units/week, but the most recent 4 periods (P30-P33) average 409 units/week. Given the high stockout risk (ending inventory has been 0 in 6 of the last 7 periods), I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture this accelerating trend and avoid under-ordering. \u03c3\u0302 will also be set based on the last 4 periods to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation ~136). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P28, P29).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak acceleration: Demand in late September (P33) spiked to 612 units, increasing the recent 4-period average to ~409 units/week compared to the previous autumn avg of ~300.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5939.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn demand regime for the Mariette Blazer is showing significant volatility with an extreme spike in Period 33 (612 units) followed by a return to a high but more moderate level in Period 34 (313 units). Since Period 27, the autumn average is approximately 342 units/week, but the last 5 weeks (P30-P34) average 384 units/week. To protect against the high volatility observed (standard deviation recently has been very high), I am using N=8 for mu_hat to capture the full autumn transition and its average (~317/week), while using N=5 for sigma_hat to specifically capture the recent extreme demand variance. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (8 units), but a massive pipeline of 1571 units exists (due to orders of 374, 189, 375, and 633 in P31-P34), which should begin arriving next period. The OR backend's cap will naturally mediate the order size to prevent over-ordering against this pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak volatility: Demand reached a high of 612 (P33) but has since corrected to 313 (P34). The current autumn regime (P27-P34) averages ~342 units/week with high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5278.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its autumn peak season (October). Historical demand analysis shows a significant surge starting in late August (Period 27), with the current autumn regime (Period 27-35) averaging 335 units/week. However, recent weeks have shown extreme volatility, with demand spiking to 612 (Period 33) before settling closer to 300 (283 in Period 35). To address this, I will use a recent_N (N=9) window to capture only the autumn regime statistics, which properly reflects the higher mean and elevated variance compared to the summer floor. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data. The high in-transit volume (1745 units) is a result of large orders placed during the recent weeks of low stock-outs to build a buffer for the seasonal peak. With an on-hand inventory of 99 and 1745 in transit, future arrivals should soon mitigate the stock-out risks seen in September.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P27-P35) stabilized with a mean of ~335 units/week and significantly higher volatility compared to spring or summer, characterized by peak spikes above 600 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn demand regime (starting P27) remains the current focus. Since P27, demand has averaged ~329 units/week (geometric mean of P27-P36 excluding the outlier). However, recent demand has stabilized (P34-P36: 313, 283, 282), averaging ~293 units. The previous peak of 612 (P33) significantly skewed the variance. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the full autumn regime (P27-P36) which averages ~335 units/week. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to account for the high volatility seen during this period (std dev ~102). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (6 units), but a large order (375 units from P33) is expected to arrive during the current period (P37), helping to meet demand after the decision phase.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The 'Mariette Blazer' is in its peak autumn demand season. Over the last 11 periods (P27-P37), demand has shifted from summer lows to a substantial autumn regime, averaging ~333 units/week. While we saw a massive spike of 612 in P33, the subsequent four periods (P34-P37) have stabilized significantly, showing demand between 282 and 313 (avg 298), suggesting the extreme volatility of late September has cooled into a consistent high-volume plateau for late October. The actual lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by the P33 order arriving exactly in P37 resolution). We are currently in a high inventory position relative to previous periods because recent large orders are arriving (375 units arrived in P37, and 633 were ordered in P34 which are due next period). I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat to capture the entire autumn regime (mean ~333) and the same for sigma_hat to account for the P33 volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock for this late-autumn high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand plateau confirmed (P34-P37): Following the late-September peak, demand has stabilized at ~298 units/week, maintaining the high-volume autumn regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in an autumn demand plateau following a late-September peak. Demand over the last five periods (P34-P38) has averaged ~315 units/week (313, 283, 282, 313, 385), with P38 showing an uptick to 385. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' message (ordered P34, arrived P38). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recent plateau and the slight uptick, while using the last 12 periods (N=12) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen since the start of the autumn regime (including the P33 spike). This ensures the OR backend provides enough safety stock for the observed volatility while tracking the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand uptick: P38 demand increased to 385 units, interrupting the ~300 unit/week plateau observed from P34-P37.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in the middle of its high-demand autumn tailoring season. Current demand (P39: 231) has dropped slightly from the previous week's uptick (P38: 385), but remains significantly higher than prehistoric or summer levels. The autumn regime (P27-P39) averages approximately 326 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P38 and P39). On-hand inventory is healthy at 633, but the pipeline is necessary to cover the (L+1) window. Given we are approaching mid-November, I expect demand to remain stable or slightly decrease as the autumn peak passes, but I will maintain a recent_N strategy (N=13, covering the autumn period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's high volume and volatility (~342 mean P27-P39). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance seen in this category during the autumn months.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P27-P39) is sustained at an average of ~326 units/week, with high volatility (spikes >600) compared to spring/summer levels.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November), historically a high-demand period for women's tailoring (autumn/winter season). Since the Autumn regime shift in Period 27, demand has stabilized at a significantly higher level than spring or summer. The average demand from P27 to P40 is approximately 326 units per week. While there was a significant peak of 612 in P33, the more recent four-period average (P37-P40) is 301 units per week, indicating a slight softening but still a robust high-volume regime. lead_time remains confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 598 with 1111 in transit (total pipeline = 1709). Given the Lead Time of 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on the recent stabilization around 300, 5 * 300 = 1500 units. Current inventory (1709) provides a buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (P27-P40) to capture the full autumn regime shift's mean and variance for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the backend accounts for the higher volatility seen recently.

Since the autumn peak in late September (P33), demand has moderated but remains substantially higher than summer levels. The average demand from the start of the autumn surge (P27) to the most recent period (P41) is approximately 320 units/week, though recent weeks (P39-P41) suggest a softening toward an average of ~251 units. I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the full autumn regime including the volatility, which provides a balanced buffer for the current 'Dressed' tailoring category. On-hand (590) plus in-transit (1124) totals 1714 units, which covers approximately 5.3 periods of autumn-level demand (avg ~320). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The OR backend will likely place a small or zero order this period as pipeline inventory is healthy relative to the softening trend.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P27-P41) shows a sustained shift with an average of ~320 units/week. Most recent 3-period average (P39-P41) has moderated to ~250 units/week, indicating a potential late-season tapering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13785.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked significantly to 733 units. This is likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales events (Nov 25-Dec 2 timeframe), which significantly impacts 'Womens Tailoring' and 'Dressed' categories. While the previous 3nd-order average had moderated to ~250 units, this spike indicates holiday volatility. On-hand inventory has dropped to 142 units, but there is a large pipeline of 1053 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the spike, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N=8 to capture the high-volume autumn/winter regime (~330 units/week) while allowing for the extreme volatility observed in P42. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to accommodate the large variance (spikes of 612 and 733). This strategy maintains a high base stock to protect against further December holiday surges while acknowledging the large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Demand surged to 733 units in Period 42 (late Nov), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday events. This reinforces the high-volatility nature of the autumn/winter tailoring regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (early December). The item is a tailored blazer, which experienced a significant holiday spike in Period 42 (733 units) followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (169 units). This post-holiday slump is typical for this category. The pipeline is currently extremely high (1360 units in-transit), primarily due to aggressive ordering following the Period 42 spike. However, demand is expected to remain lower through December compared to the autumn peak. To prevent excessive holding costs from the massive pipeline arriving in future periods, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=5) to capture the moderation in demand (avg ~340 including the spike, but moving toward the 169 seen last week). The pipeline is likely already sufficient to cover the remaining periods (up to Period 47), so the backend will naturally taper order volume.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration: Demand dropped from 733 (Period 42) to 169 (Period 43) following the late-November peak, following seasonal trends for tailored blazers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5518.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019/12/16). Historically, demand for blazers peaked twice: first in spring (April) and more significantly in autumn (September-November). Following the Black Friday spike (P42: 733 units), demand showed a sharp correction but recently rebounded to 304 units (P44). Given we are approaching late December, I expect demand to moderate as the formal/office tailoring season ends and holiday closures begin. The autumn/winter regime (P27-P44) has an average of ~330 units, but recent weeks (P43-P44) reflect high volatility (169 to 304). I will use a 5-period average (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this late-season volatility and the holiday-impacted levels, setting the target to approximately 350 units/week across the lead time to avoid stockouts if another December spike occurs before the year-end slowdown. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand volatility: Following the late-November peak, demand dropped to 169 (P43) before rebounding to 304 (P44), indicating a transition period in late December with high variance.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 falls on Dec 23rd. Historical patterns for women's tailoring show a peak in autumn/late November (Black Friday), followed by a moderate deceleration toward the end of the year. Recent demand (P43-P45) has been 169, 304, and 258 units, averaging 244 units/week. This is lower than the autumn peak avg (~320) but higher than the summer floor (~107). With lead time confirmed at 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Although in-transit inventory is high (2039), current on-hand is only 250. To avoid stockouts while acknowledging the post-holiday moderation, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-peak volatility and mean demand (which includes the 733 spike within its window, providing a safe buffer). Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition (Dec): Demand has moderated from late-Nov peaks but remains volatile, averaging ~244 units/week (P43-P45). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30. We are entering the post-holiday/New Year period. Historically, for this SKU (Mariette Blazer), we saw a significant demand surge in late February for spring tailoring. In the immediate past, we observed a peak in late November (Black Friday) followed by a volatile December averaging ~215 units/week. Period 46 demand was 128 units, continuing the late-December moderation. The pipeline is currently very high (2069 units in-transit). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and the likely continuation of the post-holiday demand dip before the spring surge in February, I am using a recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current moderation (~197/week) while maintaining a buffer for potential early January volatility. This prevents over-ordering while the large in-transit volume clears and prepares for the spring transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration confirmed (Dec avg ~215, down from autumn peak levels). Pipeline is heavily loaded with 2000+ units following high late-year ordering. Monitoring for early spring tailoring surge typically seen in Feb.
