Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 253448003 (Women's Push-up Bra). Analysis of the 5 historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean demand of 43.6 units/week (54, 38, 37, 54, 35). There is no strong evidence of a trend or regime shift yet, though demand varies between 35 and 54. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the most recent stability, and 'default' for lead time as we have no arrival history yet to suggest the actual differs from promised. This will allow the OR backend to compute a target stock level for the L+1 window.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a push-up bra, a core lingerie item with relatively stable demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 60 units (the initial pipeline), but since on-hand inventory was 0, we had a stockout (demand=37, sold=0). The order placed in Period 1 (60 units) is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive in Period 5 (1+4=5). Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks: 54, 38, 37, 54, 35) average 43.6 units per week. Period 1 demand was 37, which is consistent with this range. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent stable demand regime. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) as we have no evidence yet of lead-time drift or lost shipments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The SKU is a 'Push-up bra', a staple item with demand observed in the provided samples (mean ~43.6, std ~9.3). Actual demand in Period 1 (37) and Period 2 (55) aligns with this historical range. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time (L=4) hasn't passed yet; orders from Period 1 and Period 2 are in-transit (Total 114). Since there is no indication of lead time deviation yet (we only see the 'conclude' message for Period 2, and the first order won't arrive until Period 5's resolution phase), I will use 'default' for L. For \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, I will use a window of recent demand samples (N=5 including provided history and P1/P2) to capture current demand levels. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time and the current period (L+1).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a women's push-up bra. Historical demand samples (before simulation) were: 54, 38, 37, 54, 35 (mean ~43.6). In-game demand for Periods 1-3 has been 37, 55, and 55, showing a slight uptick compared to the historical average, possibly due to post-February seasonal trends or product lifecycle. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (60 units), Period 2 (54 units), and Period 3 (60 units) are all in-transit. Per the 'Critical Timing Example', the P1 order (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5 resolution and be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use the recent in-game demand (average ~49) to set mu_hat, while keeping L at the promised 4 until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU is a Women's Push-up Bra. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect the first arrival to occur during Period 5 (Arrival resolution happens after the decision). We will see this arrival in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments have arrived yet, and we have 242 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4). Historical demand samples (before P1) were [54, 38, 37, 54, 35], and actual demand during the first 4 periods [37, 55, 55, 37] aligns with this range. The mean demand is approximately 45 units per week. With L=4, the pipeline (1+L) covers 5 weeks of demand. Our goal is to maintain the base stock level around 225-275 units. No shipments are technically overdue yet based on the L=4 definition. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (capturing the most recent data) and 'default' for lead time as we have no confirmed deviations yet.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's push-up bra. On-hand inventory is 30 units with 197 units in transit. Period 5 confirmed the promised lead time (L=4) for the first order (ordered P1, arrived P5). Historical demand samples [54, 38, 37, 54, 35, 37, 55, 55, 37, 30] show a mean of ~43 units per period. There's no clear evidence of a demand shift or seasonality yet, though we just cleared a stockout in Period 5. The pipeline inventory (197) is substantial, covering roughly 4.5 periods of average demand. I will use 'calculate' for L as the first observation matches promised, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 (all available history) to stabilize the forecast against early-game stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). Historical demand data and recent performance (Periods 1-6) show a stable mean demand. The average demand across all available samples (including history) is approximately 43 units per period. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in Period 5 and 6 conclusions). On-hand inventory is 41, with 169 units in-transit. The OR backend's default base stock (using L=4) aims to cover 5 periods of demand. Given the product (women's lingerie) and the lack of upcoming major holidays in the immediate Melbourne calendar for this specific week, I will stick to recent averages (N=6 for the game periods + the provided history) to determine mu_hat and sigma_hat. The high profit margin ($19) versus holding cost ($1) justifies maintaining a high service level, which the OR backend calculation naturally provides.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a push-up bra, which generally follows stable demand patterns. Historical demand shows a stable regime with a mean of approximately 45 units/period (recent samples: 30, 43, 45). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving exactly 4 periods later. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 150 units, which represents orders from P4 (68), P5 (15), P6 (26), and P7 (41). Combined with On-hand (56), the total position is 206 units. Given L=4, we must cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat yields a base stock target that the OR backend will use to determine if a new order is needed. The current total inventory position (206) is roughly 4.6 times the current periodic mean (45), suggesting we are well-positioned. We use recent_N=3 for demand parameters to capture the current stable trend post-initialization.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), the SKU 253448003 (Women's Push-up Bra) is entering the mid-spring season. Distribution data from Periods 5-8 confirms a stable actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand spiked significantly in Period 8 (83 units) compared to the previous average of ~44 units per period from Period 2 to Period 7. This jump likely reflects a seasonal shift or promotion as the calendar transitions deeper into spring. To react to this increased demand without over-indexing on a single high data point, I will use a recent_N strategy for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using the last 5 samples (Periods 4-8), which balances the lower early-March demands with the recent spike. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as history consistently confirms the 4-period lead time. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock (targeting approx. (4+1) = 5 weeks of coverage) to handle the higher demand regime while mitigating stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected Period 8: Demand increased to 83, significant jump from previous average of 44 units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are managing a Push-up bra SKU. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P5 order arrived P9). Demand context: Historical samples (Jan/Feb) averaged ~44 units. Period 8 saw a spike to 83, followed by a return to 41 in Period 9. Given this volatility and the previous 'regime shift' note in Carry-over insights, the demand is currently unstable. Our on-hand inventory is low (15 units) but 170 units are in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Period 10's arriving order (placed P6) should be 26 units. Setting L=4 (promised/observed). Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to account for the recent spike (Avg P7-P9 = 56.33), aiming for a base stock that covers (1+L)=5 periods of demand. For sigma_hat, using recent_N=5 to capture the increase in volatility seen in the last 5 weeks.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 starts with 0 on-hand inventory and 234 units in-transit. A stockout occurred in Period 10 (demand 58, sold 41). The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in history). The demand analysis shows a baseline of ~44 units, with a notable spike in Period 8 (83 units) and a moderate elevated level in Period 10 (58 units). The current date is April 22nd. While there isn't a massive sustained regime shift yet, the recent average (approx. 60 units over the last 3 visible periods) is higher than the early history. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh these higher recent values more heavily to recover from the stockout and prepare for potentially higher spring-season demand for lingerie. L will remain at the promised/observed 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019/04/29). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent history. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with lost sales occurring in Period 10 and 11 due to demand exceeding available units. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 289 units (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Demand has shifted: after Period 8's spike of 83, observed demand has been 41, 58, and 64 (average 61.5). This represents a sustained increase from the initial average (~44). I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime (Periods 8-11: 83, 41, 58, 64), which effectively forecasts for the 1+L (5 period) risk window. L remains default (4). Sigma_hat uses recent_N=11 to reflect the higher volatility seen since the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime shift: Average demand from Period 8-11 is 61.5 units, up from the initial 44 units (+40%), likely due to a seasonal lift in the Lingerie category.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are managing a push-up bra SKU with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 8 (April), we have observed a significant demand regime shift where the average demand rose from ~44 to ~61.5 units, likely due to spring/summer seasonality for lingerie. We are currently facing a stockout situation: the on-hand inventory is 0, and we have not been able to satisfy full demand in Periods 10, 11, and 12. Although there are 343 units in-transit, the arrivals in the next few periods (from orders placed in Periods 9-12) may barely cover the current demand levels. To recover from the stockout and capitalize on the higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (Period 8 to 12) which captures this higher average demand of ~64.8 units. I will set L to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent 4-period lead time observation, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14 (2019/5/13). The SKU is a 'Push-up bra in microfibre', belonging to the Lingerie category. The demand data shows a clear regime shift starting around Period 8. The initial mean (Period 1-7 plus historical samples) was approximately 44 units. From Period 8 to 13, demand has been: 83, 41, 58, 64, 73, 79, resulting in a new mean of approximately 66.3. This represents a ~50% increase from the early season mean, likely due to spring seasonality for this category. In-transit inventory is high (296 units), but on-hand is low (3). Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, and P13 all confirm L=4). I will set L to 'calculate' as it is stable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_6' to capture the higher demand regime that started at Period 8, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current elevated demand levels (around 66 units/period) rather than the lower historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 13: Average demand since Period 8 has risen to 66 units, representing a sustained ~50% increase over the initial 44 units/period baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1767.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory, despite a large arrival of 90 units in Period 14, as demand spiked to 163 units. This spike confirms a major seasonal demand surge in May for lingerie. Looking at the history, demand shifted from a baseline of ~44 to ~66 starting Period 8, but the latest sample of 163 indicates a potential second-stage peak. To handle this, I need to adjust the demand forecast upward. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have a pipeline of 296 units (from orders in Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14), the OR backend's cap mechanism might restrict ordering if L or mu_hat are too low. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value based on the recent higher demand (averaging last 4 periods: (64+73+79+163)/4 = 94.75; mu_hat = (1+L)*94.75 \u2248 474) to ensure the target base stock is high enough to cover this new peak and pull inventory through the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in Period 14: Demand hit 163 units, more than double the previous shifted average of 66. May appears to be a major seasonal peak for this lingerie SKU.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 is May 27, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak in May for this lingerie SKU, with Period 14 and 15 demands hitting 163 and 141 respectively. This far exceeds the earlier baseline (~44) and the intermediate regime (~66). The current stockout (ending on-hand=0) despite 96 units arriving in Period 15 indicates that replenishment is trailing demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are at the tail end of May, I expect demand to remain high but potentially begin stabilizing or cooling slightly compared to the sudden peak. Therefore, I am shifting mu_hat to a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 (covering the regime shift from Period 8 onwards) to capture the higher mean while acknowledging the extreme volatility recently observed. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=8) to ensure the OR engine accounts for the drastically increased variance seen in the last 8 periods, helping to avoid further stockouts during this high-demand window.

Carry-over insight: May peak confirmed: Demand for Periods 14-15 averaged 152 units, more than double the previous shifted average of 66. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 17 (June 3). Previous data confirms a significant seasonal peak in May (Periods 14-16), where demand averaged approximately 147 units per period (163, 141, 139). This is a dramatic increase from the April regime of ~66 units. As we move into June, we need to decide if this high volume will persist or revert. Lingerie often sees sustained spring/summer interest, but the extreme peak of mid-May might soften slightly. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 443 units (orders from P13-P16). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level. To prevent excessive stock-outs while acknowledging the recent high demand, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the full May peak (avg ~147), but I will set L to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent 4st-period performance and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed during the peak.

Carry-over insight: May peak (Periods 14-16) demand stabilized at an average of 147.7 units/period, roughly 2.2x the previous regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019-06-10), we are exiting the peak seasonal demand observed in May for this lingerie SKU. Demand peaked around mid-May (P14: 163 units) and has begun a downward trend (P15: 141, P16: 139, P17: 105). Despite the high demand, the system has been facing stockouts because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) were insufficient for the seasonal surge. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and 578 units in-transit (orders from P14-P17: 90+160+158+170=578), we are heavily backloaded with stock that was ordered during the peak. To avoid significant overstocking as demand cools down towards the pre-peak regime (approx 66 units/period), I am setting mu_hat to capture the average of the last 4 periods (approx 137 units/period) to bridge the transition while remaining cautious. L is set to calculated as it is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-May peak cooling detected: Period 17 demand (105) shows a ~25% drop from the May average (147.7), suggesting the seasonal peak is ending.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context shows we are clearly past the May seasonal peak (Periods 14-16 averaged 147.7 units). Period 17 (105 units) and Period 18 (80 units) confirm a cooling trend. The current demand regime has stabilized back toward the pre-peak average of ~70 units. I am using a recent_N of 2 for mu_hat (avg 92.5) to capture this cooling while remaining slightly conservative to avoid stockouts, as the current on-hand inventory is very low (10 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on history. Sigma_hat is calculated using a slightly longer window (N=5) to account for the high volatility experienced during the transition from the May peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-May cooling trend stabilized: Demand in Period 18 dropped to 80 units, confirming the end of the seasonal peak and return toward the 65-75 units/period regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). We are exiting the May seasonal peak (Periods 14-16 average: 147.7 units) and entering a cooling phase. Period 17 demand was 105, Period 18 was 80, and Period 19 was 120. The Period 19 demand of 120 is slightly higher than the previous two weeks but still well below the May peak, suggesting fluctuations around a post-peak average of ~100 units/period. The Carry-over insights previously estimated a return to 65-75 units, but current data (P17-P19 avg: 101.6) suggests a slower decline. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 50 units on-hand and 505 in-transit (P16: 158, P17: 170, P18: 177 arriving in P20, P21, P22 respectively), the pipeline is very full. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this post-peak cooling average of ~101.6 units per period across the (1+L) window, which helps prevent over-ordering as demand settles. Lead time remains calculated at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling regime (Period 17-19): Demand average stabilized at 101.6 units/period, down ~30% from May peak (147.7) but remaining higher than the April baseline (66).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1). Demand for the last four periods (17-20) has been 105, 80, 120, and 89, confirming the end of the May seasonal peak and stabilization into a summer regime. The average demand over these 4 periods is 98.5 units, which is lower than the May peak (~147) but still higher than the April baseline (~66). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the current inventory position (On-hand: 119 + In-transit: 375 = 494) must cover the next 5 periods of demand (L+1), and the current regime is averaging ~98.5, the total required stock is approximately 492.5 units. The pipeline is currently full enough to meet this immediate need. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect this post-peak stabilization and sigma_hat with recent_N (N=4) to capture the current volatility and maintain service levels without over-ordering as the season cools.

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization regime (Period 17-20): Demand has stabilized at an average of 98.5 units/period, following the May peak.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'OP Push Melbourne' (Women's Lingerie) has transitioned out of the significant May seasonal peak (averaging ~148 units) into a summer stabilization phase. Current demand over the last four periods (P18-P21: 80, 120, 89, 70) averages 89.75 units. This is lower than the peak but remains higher than the pre-peak baseline of 66 units. Current on-hand inventory is 219, and in-transit is 269 (orders from P18: 177, P20: 28, P21: 64). Expected total inventory (488) is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate (~90 units/period). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P17-P21) to capture the current stabilization trend (~93 units/period) while lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The 'May peak' (Periods 14-16) average demand was 147.7 units. Subsequently, demand has cooled and stabilized into a 'Summer stabilization' regime. For the last five periods (Period 18-22), demand values were 80, 120, 89, 70, and 85, resulting in an average of 88.8 units per period. This confirms the cooling trend noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is rock solid at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (311 units) because large orders placed during the May peak (to capture the then-high demand) are now arriving (177 units arrived in Period 22). To avoid excessive holding costs while demand settles, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized post-peak demand (approx. 88.8 units/period). I will also use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the May spike. This approach helps the OR backend lower the base stock level to match the new, lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization confirmed (Periods 18-22): Demand has settled at an average of 88.8 units/period, down from the May peak of 147.7, but remaining above the initial baseline of 44.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 24 (2019/07/22). Reviewing the history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods. The demand for SKU 253448003 has moved through several distinct phases: an initial baseline of ~44, an April lift to ~66, a May peak of ~147, and a summer stabilization. The most recent regime (Periods 18-23) shows demand values of 80, 120, 89, 70, 85, 83. This averages approximately 87.8 units per period. The Period 23 'conclude' message shows arrived=0, which is expected since the last order with a 4-period lead time was placed in Period 18 and arrived in Period 22; the order from Period 19 was 0 units, so Period 23 correctly shows 0 arrivals. On-hand inventory is 228 units, and In-transit is 203 (orders from P20, P21, P22, P23). Total pipeline + on-hand is 431 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and the need to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand, 431 units covers approximately 86 units per period. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this 'Summer stabilization' regime more precisely for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it reflects the current post-peak demand level.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The 'Summer stabilization' regime (Period 18-24) shows demand averaging 89.8 units/period. The May peak (Period 14-16) is definitively over, and we have entered a phase of relatively steady demand following a post-peak cooling period. Period 23 saw a missing shipment (Period 19 order was 0, so no arrival was expected, but the check for Period 20's order arriving in Period 24 confirmed the 4-period lead time remains accurate). On-hand inventory is 155, and in-transit is 246 (total 401). Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat targets the current stable summer trend (Period 18-24). This ensures the OR engine calculates base stock based on the current average of ~90 units rather than the higher May levels or the lower Q1 baseline.

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization regime (Period 18-24): Demand has stabilized at an average of 89.8 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448003' (Push-up bra) is currently in a stable summer regime following a significant May peak. Demand has stabilized around an average of 89.8 units/period over the last 8 weeks (Periods 18-25). Recent demand in Period 25 was 76 units, consistent with this stabilized range. Lead time is reliably 4 periods, confirmed by multiple recent arrivals. Pipeline reconciliation: Period 22 order (50 units) is expected to arrive in Period 26 (current), Period 23 order (61 units) in Period 27, and so on. Note that the Period 19 order was 0, which contributes to the current 'low' in-transit volume compared to the previous peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the current stable demand regime (approx. 90 units/period) and L to calculate to reflect the consistent 4-period lead time.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448003' (Push-up bra) is currently in a post-May seasonal stabilization phase. Recent demand since the cooling period (Period 18 onwards) has averaged approximately 89.8 units/period. However, Period 26 saw a significant increase to 124 units. While this could be a random spike, it's important to monitor for a potential late-summer or 'Back to School' lift. The order from Period 19 (which had an order quantity of 0) failed to arrive in Period 23 as expected, but this was a zero-unit order, so 'arrived=0' is correct. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 69, which is lower than the recent average demand, but in-transit inventory is healthy at 306 units (covering orders from Periods 23, 24, 25, and 26). To maintain a high service level while managing volatility, I will use a recent N of 9 (capturing the regime since the post-May drop at P18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This N balances the stabilization trend (avg ~90) with the recent spike (124).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. This SKU (Push-up bra) is currently in a summer stabilization regime following a May peak. Demand over the last 10 periods (since Period 18) has averaged 93.8 units per period, showing a slight uptick in the recent 2 periods (124 and 110). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 23 order in Period 27. On-hand inventory is 20 units with 369 in-transit. To ensure we cover demand across the next 5 periods (L+1) and account for the recent slight increase in demand while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the post-May stabilization average of ~94 units. This provides a balance between the lower early-July demand and the higher August demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization regime (Periods 18-27): Demand has averaged 93.8 units/period, showing a slight increasing trend heading into late August compared to the July average of ~89.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Demand has transitioned from the 'Summer stabilization' (approx. 90 units/period) into a higher late-August/early-September regime. Demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) averaged 112.3 units, signaling a significant (~25%) increase over the previous summer baseline. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but a large pipeline (423 units) exists. Specifically, order P25 (108 units) is expected to arrive this period (P29), followed by P26 (66 units) in P30. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stockout risk and the recent demand uptick, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the latest demand trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory policy reacts to the higher volume observed in late August.

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand shift (Periods 26-28): Demand has increased to an average of 112.3 units/period, a ~25% rise over the previous summer average of 90 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) averaged 112.3 units, signaling a shift from the previous summer average of ~90 units. Period 29 demand was 98 units, which aligns with this slightly higher regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this late-August/early-September demand level (averaging ~109 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (order placed in P25 arrived in P29). On-hand inventory is low (10 units), but there is a significant pipeline (445 units). A lead time of 4 means we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). My parameters use the recent higher demand to ensure the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock level to prevent stockouts during this sustained elevated demand period.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (P26-P29): Demand has averaged 108.8 units/period, confirming a sustained shift from the ~90 unit summer average.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The 'September demand regime' identified in the carry-over insights showed an average demand of 108.8 units (P26-P29). However, demand in Period 30 dropped significantly to 61 units, which is lower than the previous regime and even the summer average. This could be a one-off fluctuation or the start of a cooling period as we move into September. Given this uncertainty and the current low on-hand inventory (15 units), I will use a balanced approach. I'll setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P26-P30) to capture the recent higher average (avg=99.2) while allowing for the recent dip to influence the forecast. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P26 order arriving in P30). The high in-transit (507) vs on-hand (15) suggests large orders from the late-August shift are still in the pipeline. I will set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility observed in the last 5 periods (std \u2248 24.8).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-September (2019/9/16). Recent demand has shown high volatility: Period 30 was 61 and Period 31 was 47, significantly lower than the projected September average of 108.8 units recorded in the Period 30 carry-over. This suggests either a tapering of the September demand shift or a temporary dip. Looking at the historical samples and cycle, demand often fluctuates. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P27 order arrived P31). Current on-hand is 92, with 444 units in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=6 to capture the transition from late August into current September levels (P26-P31: 124, 110, 103, 98, 61, 47), which averages 90.5 units/period. This is more conservative than the 108 average but higher than the last two weeks, protecting against both stockouts and overstock. sigma_hat will use N=6 to reflect this recent volatility. L will remain 'default' as lead time is consistent.

Carry-over insight: September demand dip detected: Periods 30-31 average 54 units, down significantly from the P26-P29 average of 108.8 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September/early October. Historical demand for the last three periods (P30-P32) shows a significant dip, averaging 49.3 units (61, 47, 40), compared to the late-August peak of 108.8. This reflects the cooling period after the back-to-school/late-summer season. Current on-hand inventory is 177, with 346 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are currently covered for approximately 10 weeks of demand at the recent average rate (177 on-hand + 346 transit = 523 units; 523 / 50 = 10.4 weeks). To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current dip while maintaining a standard 'calculate' lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: September demand dip confirmed: Periods 30-32 average demand dropped to 49.3 units/period, down from the late-August average of 108.8 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand recovered to 84 units after a three-period dip (averaging ~49 units). This suggests the late-September low may have concluded, possibly heading into an October seasonal lift. The current inventory position is strong: on-hand (223) plus in-transit (216) totals 439 units. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we are currently covered for over 7 periods of demand at the recent average of 58-60 units/period. For the OR parameters, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to incorporate both the dip and the most recent recovery (averaging 58 units/period), and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility during this transition. This approach helps the OR logic moderate new orders while we consume the existing surplus, while remaining sensitive to a potential October recovery.

Carry-over insight: September demand dip appears to have ended in Period 33 with a bounce to 84 units, following a three-week average of 49.3 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Inventory is high (304 on-hand) due to a recent demand dip in September. Demand recently showed a bounce to 84 units (Period 33) but softened again to 47 units (Period 34). Historically, this SKU (Push-up bra) had a significant peak in May and stabilized through the summer around 90 units. Looking at the history, September (Periods 30-34) has been volatile, averaging ~56 units, which is lower than the summer average but higher than the initial Q1 baseline. Given the upcoming Q4 period, I expect demand to potentially recover toward the summer stabilization levels (approx. 90 units) rather than staying at the depressed September levels. However, with 304 units on-hand and 88 in-transit (Total pipeline = 392), we are well-covered for the next 4-5 periods even if demand returns to 90/week. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7, covering the late-August shift and the September dip) to balance the recent volatility while accounting for the broader trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand (P30-P34) averaged 55.8 units/period, a significant decrease from the August average of 110 units/period, but remains above the Q1 baseline of 44.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. The SKU is a push-up bra, which recently underwent a significant demand dip in September (P30-P34 avg: 55.8 units) compared to the August peak. However, recent demand (P33: 84, P34: 47, P35: 27) shows continued volatility and a downward trend as we move further into autumn. On-hand inventory is currently very high (338 units) due to arrivals from previous high-order periods (P30, P31) which coincided with the demand drop. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current cooled-down demand regime (avg ~55 units), there is a significant risk of accumulation and high holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6, covering P30-P35) to capture the recent lower-demand regime and prevent over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: October demand shift: Periods 33-35 show a further cooling with an average demand of 52.7 units/period, continuing the downward trend from the August peak (110 units) toward the Q1 baseline (44 units).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. The SKU is a push-up bra, which exhibits strong seasonality. We have transitioned from a high-demand late-summer/August peak (~110 units) into a significantly lower October demand regime. Demand for the last three periods (P34-P36) has been consistently low: 47, 27, and 29 units respectively, averaging 34.3 units. This is even lower than our initial Q1 baseline of 44. Inventory levels are currently very high (On-hand: 336), which is sufficient to cover nearly 10 periods of current demand. With an in-transit quantity of 47 units (from Period 35), the total pipeline is extremely healthy. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (covering Periods 33-36) to capture this cooling trend (average ~46.7, versus the August average of 110) to prevent unnecessary ordering and minimize holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: October cooling confirmed: Demand for Periods 34-36 has averaged 34.3 units/period, falling below the initial Q1 baseline of 44 and significantly down from the August peak of 110.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand has entered a cooling phase following the August peak. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has fallen to 47, 27, 29, and 33 units, respectively (average 34.0), which is below the initial Q1 baseline of 44. Currently, there is a high on-hand inventory of 303 units. With the 'October cooling' regime confirmed and sustained for 4 periods, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this lower demand level. I am using L=default (promised lead time of 4) as the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods. The high on-hand inventory relative to the new lower demand (approx. 9 periods of stock) will naturally lead the OR backend to restrict further ordering to minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: October cooling regime confirmed (P34-P37): Average demand has dropped to 34.0 units/period, roughly 23% below the original Q1 baseline (44) and significantly down from summer levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has been 47, 27, 29, 33, and 26, averaging 32.4 units per period. This confirms the cooling regime identified in previous periods, which is significantly lower than the summer/August peak. On-hand inventory is currently high at 277 units. Given the low demand and high stock, the priority is to avoid further holding costs while maintaining a service level for this lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical evidence. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the stability of this current low-demand period (approx. 32 units/period). This results in a lower base stock, which, given our high on-hand inventory (277), will likely result in the OR backend placing no new orders (final order = 0) until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: November demand stabilization: Demand for Periods 34-38 has stabilized at an average of 32.4 units/period, confirming a sustained low-demand regime for late autumn/early winter.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained low-demand regime for late autumn/early winter. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has stabilized at a mean of 32.0 units per period (47, 27, 29, 33, 26). The current on-hand inventory of 299 units is extremely high relative to this demand level, providing approximately 9 periods of coverage. In-transit inventory is essentially zero (the P35 order arrived this period). Given the lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory buffer, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=6 to capture this current low-demand regime and prevent the OR engine from over-ordering while the system burns through excess stock. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime confirmed (P34-P39): Average demand is 30.8 units/period, down from the initial Q1 baseline of 44, reflecting late autumn seasonality for this lingerie SKU.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 41 (2019/11/18). The product is a push-up bra, which exhibited a significant seasonal peak in May (approx. 148 units/period) and a secondary rise in August (approx. 110 units/period). Demand has since entered a sustained low-demand regime for late autumn, with an average of 30.8 units per period over the last 7 weeks (P34-P40). On-hand inventory is 268 units with 0 units in-transit. Since the current demand average is ~31 units and the lead time is 4 periods, we require a base stock of roughly (1+L) * mu = 5 * 31 = 155 units. With 268 units on hand, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand levels. No new orders are needed. The 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=7 captures the current low-demand regime accurately, and 'calculate' for lead time remains appropriate based on a stable history of 4-period arrivals.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained low-demand regime characteristic of late autumn/winter. Over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), demand has averaged approximately 30.6 units per period, consistently staying well below the initial 44-unit baseline and the summer peaks. The current on-hand inventory is 241 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At the current average demand of ~31, total expected demand through the lead time is approximately 155 units. With 241 units on hand, the system is significantly overstocked relative to current demand levels ($241 > 155$). No new orders are needed. The OR backend will naturally suppress ordering as on-hand exceeds the base stock level calculated from these parameters. Using N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand period since the end of October.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P43 (Dec 2, 2019). The SKU is a push-up bra, and we are entering the holiday shopping season. Historical demand for the most recent regime (P34-P42) has been relatively low, averaging 32.2 units/period, significantly below the initial Q1 baseline. However, Period 42 showed a jump to 42 units, possibly signaling the start of a December/Holiday lift common for lingerie SKU. On-hand inventory is 199 units with 0 in-transit. With a lead time of 4 periods, this inventory needs to cover demand through P47 (the final period). Given the avg demand of ~32 units, 199 is ample (approx 6 periods of stock). However, to account for potential holiday spikes and ensure we don't stock out in the final weeks, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the low-demand baseline while allowing the OR engine to maintain safety stock. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been highly consistent. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=9) to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Slight demand uptick in Period 42 (42 units) may signal early December holiday seasonality in the Lingerie category.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 34 (average ~31 units). While Period 42 showed a brief uptick (42 units), Period 43 returned to a low value (17 units), suggesting that a major pre-holiday spike hasn't fully materialized or may be muted for this specific SKU. On-hand inventory is 182 units with 0 in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, my current inventory covers roughly 6 periods of demand at the recent average. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the OR backend targets a high service level. To prevent over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (Period 47), I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=10) to capture the current low-demand tray while allowing for the slight volatility seen in the last few weeks. This will naturally suppress ordering since on-hand (182) exceeds the likely base stock requirement for a ~31 unit/period product.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has significantly cooled from the summer/autumn peaks, stabilizing at a low-demand regime. Analyzing the period from P34 onwards shows an average demand of approximately 29.5 units per period. While a slight uptick was noted in P42 (42 units), the subsequent weeks (P43: 17, P44: 19) suggest that the pre-holiday surge either didn't materialize or was very brief for this specific SKU. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 163 units, which is more than enough to cover the remaining periods (45, 46, 47) even if demand spiked to previous peak levels. With only 3 periods left in the game and a high holding cost relative to the risk of stockout (given the current stock level), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11, covering the start of the low-demand regime at P34) to accurately reflect the current slow pace. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on history.

Carry-over insight: Late-year low demand regime (P34-P44) confirmed: Average demand has settled at 29.5 units/period, roughly 33% lower than the initial Q1 baseline of 44.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are approaching the end of the year (Period 46, Dec 23). The historical demand for this lingerie SKU shows a significant low-demand regime starting from October (Period 34), with an average demand of approximately 29.8 units/period over the last 12 weeks. While there was a minor uptick in Period 42 (42 units), demand has since retreated to the low 20s. With 136 units on hand and 17 units in transit, our total inventory position (153) is extremely high relative to the current demand regime of ~30 units/period (roughly 5 weeks of coverage). The OR backend's service level logic would normally trigger large orders if mu_hat is high, but given the current overstock and the persistent low demand since October, I will use recent_N (N=12) to accurately capture this sustained late-autumn/winter cooling and prevent further overstocking during this period of high holding costs relative to slow movement.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 30, 2019. The SKU is in a sustained low-demand regime typical for late autumn/early winter, with recent demand averaging approximately 29.5 units/period (P34-P44). Period 46 demand was 20 units, continuing this trend. On-hand inventory is currently high (116 units) relative to this low demand, having been drawn down from peak summer/autumn stocks. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit = 158) sufficiently covers the expected demand for the lead time + review period (approximately 30 units * 5 = 150 units), I will maintain parameters that reflect this low-demand state to avoid overstocking as we enter the new year. I'm using recent_N (N=13) to capture the trend since the start of the October cooling (Period 34).
