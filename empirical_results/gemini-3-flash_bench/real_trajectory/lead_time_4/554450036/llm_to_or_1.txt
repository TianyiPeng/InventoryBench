Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 554450036 (Julia RW Skinny Denim Trousers). Current Date is 2019-02-11. We have 5 historical demand samples (71, 60, 46, 48, 62), with an average demand of 57.4 and a standard deviation of 10.4. The product is a staple item (5-pocket superstretch denim trousers) from the 'Divided' collection, suggesting consistent demand with potential for stability. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no history of actual arrivals yet, I will use 'default' for lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent baseline while we build up in-game history. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, seeking to satisfy the critical service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the history, demand in Period 1 was 75 units, which matches the upper end of the provided baseline samples (46-71 range). We are currently in a stock-out situation (on-hand: 0) because the initial order of 75 units placed in Period 1 (with a promised lead time of 4) has not arrived yet, and we started with 0 inventory. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5 (1+4) and be visible at the start of Period 6. The 5 historical samples average 57.4 units/week. Including Period 1 demand (75), the mean is 60.3. Given the garment is 'superstretch skinny denim' (a stable staple) and we are entering mid-February, I expect demand to remain relatively steady or slightly increase as spring approaches. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture both the historical context and the recent high demand point. I'll maintain the default promised lead time of 4 as we have no 'conclude' messages to suggest otherwise yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a super-skinny denim trouser from the Divided collection. Demand history shows relative stability (71, 60, 46, 48, 62 in pre-game weeks; 75 and 60 in P1-P2). The mean demand across all 7 available weeks is approximately 60.2. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because orders placed in P1 and P2 (totaling 155 units) have not arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order from P1 is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in the P6 decision phase. Since we are only at P3, no orders should have arrived yet according to the promised lead time. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand levels (average ~60), while keeping L at default (4) as there is no evidence yet to suggest a deviation from the promised lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. This product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple super-skinny jean from the Divided collection. Demand over the last 5 weeks has been relatively stable, averaging 61.4 units (71, 60, 46, 48, 62 in the pre-game samples and 75, 60, 72 in the current game history). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because orders are subject to a 4-period lead time. An order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Total in-transit is 233 units (75+80+78). I will set L to 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead time shift. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (3 history + 2 prepopulated samples) to capture the slightly higher demand observed in the recent weeks compared to the full historical mean. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect recent volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is a staple item (super-skinny denim) which should have relatively stable demand. The historical demand samples (71, 60, 46, 48, 62) and the game history demand (75, 60, 72, 49) show a mean around 60 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (75), Period 2 (80), Period 3 (78), and Period 4 (82). Since the lead time is 4, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. In-transit inventory correctly reflects the sum of all orders placed (75+80+78+82 = 315). I will use the 'default' method for L as the promised lead time of 4 hasn't been disproven yet. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (combining the 5 pre-game samples and 4 game-history samples) to capture the most accurate current demand profile. Demand appears slightly volatile but stable around the mean.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a skinny denim trouser from the 'Divided' collection (fast fashion for youth). Historical demand shows a slight downward trend from ~70-75 in February to ~49 in March. Total in-transit is 267 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), with on-hand inventory at 26. The promised lead time of 4 periods was confirmed by the arrival of the P1 order in P5 (75 units arrived). Future orders from P2 (80 units) and P3 (78 units) are expected to arrive in P6 and P7 respectively. Given the 1-period observation delay, the P2 arrival in P6 will only be visible at the start of P7. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with N=5 to capture the recent stabilization around 50-60 units, while keeping lead time 'L' at 'default' since the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand history (including pre-game samples) shows: 71, 60, 46, 48, 62, 75, 60, 72, 49, 49, 42. The demand has stabilized at a lower level since early March (Periods 4-6 have been 49, 49, 42), compared to the late Feb/early Jan levels. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of Period 1 and Period 2 orders. With L=4, the base stock targets demand for 5 periods (L+1). My current pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 64 + 245 = 309 units. Given the recent demand average (~56 over all samples, but ~47 over the last 3 periods), 309 units covers approximately 6.5 periods of demand. This suggests we are sufficiently stocked; I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for demand to reflect the lower current demand regime while maintaining a standard lead time estimate.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). Historical demand samples (71, 60, 46, 48, 62) and actual performance (75, 60, 72, 49, 42, 43) show a relatively stable mean around 55-60 units per week. The product is skinny denim trousers, which typically has consistent demand. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory is currently 174 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), and on-hand is 99 units. Since the lead time is stable at 4, L is set to 'default'. For demand (mu_hat), recent data suggests a slight drop compared to early February peaks, so I'll use recent_N with N=5 (P3-P7: 72, 49, 49, 42, 43; mean=51). This ensures mu_hat covers 5 periods of demand (1+L=5). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 554450036 (Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS) shows a consistent mean around 55-60 units per period (samples: 71, 60, 46, 48, 62, 75, 60, 72, 49, 49, 42, 43, 70). No significant seasonal spike is expected for basic denim in early April based on the history provided. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (Period 1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Current inventory status is healthy with 111 on-hand and 119 in-transit. Pipeline inventory (119) + On-hand (111) = 230 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. With a mean demand of ~55, the base stock should targets ~275-300 units. I will use 'calculate' for L to maintain the confirmed 4-period lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=8 to capture the most recent and relevant demand stability. This ensures the OR backend continues to replenish at a pace that maintains service levels while monitoring the slightly increased demand observed in Period 8 (70 units).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450036 (Julia RW Skinny Denim) has a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, consistently evidenced by arrivals in Periods 5 through 9. Historical demand data and recent periods show a relatively stable pattern with mean weekly demand around 55 units. Recent demand samples (P5: 49, P6: 42, P7: 43, P8: 70, P9: 44) average ~50 units. However, earlier samples were higher (up to 75). Using a recent window (N=5) for demand forecasting captures the current post-launch stability. The inventory position is healthy: 94 on-hand plus 172 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9) totals 266 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of forecasted demand (5 * 50 = 250). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observed 4 periods match the promised. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the recent 5 samples to reflect the current demand regime accurately while allowing the OR backend to maintain the target service level based on the high profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019-04-22). The product is a staple item (Superstretch skinny denim). Historical demand over the last 10 periods has averaged 57.9 units/week, but the most recent 5 periods (Periods 6-10) show a lower average of 48.8 units/week compared to the initial weeks. A lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by the arrival history (Periods 5 through 10 all showed lead_time=4). Currently, we have 107 units on-hand and 140 in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Total pipeline/inventory = 247. The backend target stock level (mu_hat) represents demand for 5 periods (L+1). Using a recent 5-period window (N=5) for demand captures the recent mean (~49) and variation, while the OR logic handles the safety stock via the service level q = 19/20 = 0.95.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a staple denim item ('Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS'), which generally shows stable year-round demand but can fluctuate. Historical demand over the last 11 periods averages 52.6 units, but the most recent 5 periods (Periods 7-11) show a slightly lower, more stable average of 48.4 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 11 (all orders arrived exactly 4 periods after being placed). Currently, we have 74 units on-hand and 174 units in-transit (orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11). The OR backend calculation for base stock (L+1 demand) with L=4 requires coverage for 5 periods. Using the recent 5-period mean (48.4) as the base for mu_hat, the total expected demand over the lead time plus review period is approximately 242 units. Given the relatively low volatility in the recent regime, I will use recent_N for both mean and standard deviation to avoid over-ordering during this stable period while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and the product is skinny denim trousers. Looking at the demand history since Period 1, the demand has fluctuated between 40 and 75 units, but has stabilized significantly in the last seven periods (Periods 6-12), averaging 48.4 units per period with relatively low volatility. Using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses on this stable regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is captured by 'default'. The pipeline inventory (186 units) plus current on-hand (46 units) is 232 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of forecasted demand (approx. 242 units based on recent averages), suggesting the OR backend will order a small amount to top off the base stock.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). Demand for this denim item (Julia RW Skinny Denim) has shown a slight upward trend in recent weeks, increasing from an average of ~43 units (Periods 7-11) to ~60 units in the last two periods (Periods 12-13). Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods across all 9 concluded delivery cycles. Current on-hand (62) and in-transit (156) will be augmented by the Period 10 shipment (26 units) arriving during this period, bringing total projected inventory to ~244 units to cover the 5-period horizon (L+1). I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=5) to capture the recent uptick while smoothing past volatility, and 'default' for lead time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Demand in Period 14 spiked to 107 units, which is significantly higher than the training mean (~57) and the recent 5-period mean (~62). This spike caused a stockout (on-hand is 0). Historically, May demand for this SKU (skinny denim) appears to be increasing. Expected arrivals for Period 15 are 41 units (ordered Period 11), which matches the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since on-hand is currently 0 and recent demand suggests a possible upward regime shift or seasonal peak extending into late May/June, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the recent upward trend (averaging ~75/period), and L=4 based on consistent arrivals from Periods 1-10.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 14: Demand increased from a 5-period average of 62 to 107 units (+72%); monitoring for sustained seasonal peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime for SKU 554450036 (Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS) that began around Period 14. Demand for the last two periods (107 and 139) is significantly higher than the previous average (~55). This likely reflects a late spring/early summer seasonal peak for denim trousers. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales in Periods 14 and 15. The pipeline inventory is 277 units (orders from P12-P15). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. To capture the current demand spike and avoid further stockouts, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent surge (avg ~103) more heavily than the long-term history. This will increase the base stock level to cover the higher observed demand plus the lead time buffer.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 14-15 average demand is 123, compared to the Period 1-13 average of 57. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS transitioned significantly around Period 14 (pre-summer). In the last 3 periods (P14-P16), demand has averaged 111.3 units (107, 139, 88), a sharp increase from the previous average (~55). I will use N=3 for mu_hat to capture this higher mean, as it reflects the current seasonal 'high' better than a long-term average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P12 order arrived in P16, L=4). The SKU is currently stock-out on-hand (0 units) because recent arrivals (39 units) are significantly lower than recent demand (88 units). The pipeline (404 units) contains larger orders from P13-P16, but they are still in transit. Setting L=default (4), mu_hat N=3, and sigma_hat N=3 will allow the OR engine to calculate a higher base stock level to satisfy the current 111 units/period demand regime and recover from the on-hand stock-out.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18 (2019/06/10). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a super-skinny denim jean. We observed a significant demand regime shift starting in Period 14 (mid-May), with demand spiking to over 100 units/week. While demand dropped to 46 in Period 17, the seasonal context of early June for fashion retail often involves intermittent peaks. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units), and although there are 508 units in transit, the immediate available stock is insufficient to cover the high demand cycle seen recently. We must set parameters to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that accounts for the higher mean and volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high-demand regime (Periods 14-17: 107, 139, 88, 46 - Average: 95) and adjust sigma to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the (L+1) period target covers potential demand spikes while we wait for the large pipeline to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $730.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 14 (observed in Periods 14-16 with peaks up to 139), but the most recent two periods (17 and 18) show a sharp decline to 46 and 40 units respectively. This suggests the high-demand 'peak' may have been a temporary seasonal surge rather than a permanent step-change. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is low (30), but there is a massive pipeline (548) resulting from large orders placed during the demand spike (Periods 15-18). For Period 19, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat (covering Periods 14-18) to average the spike and the subsequent drop, preventing over-ordering while respecting the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' for N=5 to capture that increased volatility for safety stock calculation. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to continue using the stable 4-period historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly between Period 14 and 18: observed demand fluctuated between 139 and 40. The mid-May/early-June surge has subsided back to pre-regime-shift levels (approx 40-50 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $528.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' (554450036) has clearly returned to its baseline level following a significant surge from Period 14 through Period 16. The demand for the last three periods (P17: 46, P18: 40, P19: 34) demonstrates a return to approximately 40 units per week, contrasting sharply with the surge average of ~111 units. The Lead Time is stable at 4 periods. Inventory levels are now replenishing as the large orders placed during the peak (P15-P18) are beginning to arrive. Specifically, 122 units arrived in P19, and arrivals for P16 (166 units), P17 (154 units), and P18 (106 units) are expected in P20, P21, and P22 respectively. Given the current on-hand inventory of 118 and a massive pipeline of 426 units against a stabilized demand of ~40, the system is at high risk of overstocking. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this post-surge stabilization and avoid further excessive ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-surge stabilization: Period 17-19 average demand is 40 units, returning to pre-Period 14 levels (approx 40-50 units).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that the demand surge observed between Period 14 and 16 has completely subsided. Demand in Period 20 was extremely low (8 units), likely due to the end of the seasonal peak for Julia RW Skinny Denim. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) is 27.3 units, compared to the pre-spike average of ~50. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this stabilization at lower levels. On-hand inventory is currently high at 276 units with 260 units in-transit (ordered during the high-demand spike in P17-P18). Total pipeline inventory (536) significantly exceeds the required base stock for the current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (L=4). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the downward trend while smoothing the volatility of the most recent single datum.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand stabilization confirmed: Period 18-20 demand shows a sharp decline (40, 34, 8) compared to the mid-May peak. Seasonal peak for this SKU appears to have ended by late June.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' has exited its seasonal peak which occurred between Period 14 and 16. Demand has returned to a lower, yet volatile, baseline. The most recent demand was 79 (P21), while previous periods were 8 (P20), 34 (P19), and 40 (P18). Carrying-over insights correctly identified the drop, though P21 saw a slight bounce. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (351 units) and incoming pipeline (106 units), the current stock levels significantly exceed expected demand for the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak demand level (averaging ~34 units/period) and its associated volatility, allowing the OR backend to naturally stop ordering until inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand volatility confirmed: Following a drop to 8 units in Period 20, Period 21 saw a rebound to 79. Overall baseline demand remains lower than the May/June peak but more variable than the initial spring regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the SKU 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' has exited its mid-spring demand peak (Periods 14-16) and entered a post-peak regime characterized by higher volatility than the initial spring period but lower mean demand. Demand in the last two periods has stabilized at 79 units. On-hand inventory is currently very high (378 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the demand surge which are now excessive for the current demand levels (In-transit is 0). Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods in every shipping conclusion. To prevent further accumulation of expensive holding costs, I am setting parameters to reflect the recent demand stabilization. I've chosen N=4 for mu_hat (average demand of ~50 units) and N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility (8, 79, 79) while shielding against the massive outliers of the May peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Period 19 onwards) average stabilized around 50 units (Periods 19-22: 34, 8, 79, 79), but with significantly higher volatility than the pre-peak spring regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. The SKU is skinny denim trousers. We have transitioned out of a mid-May/June peak and are now in a post-peak regime characterized by stabilized mean demand but significantly higher volatility compared to the initial spring period. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) is 54.6 units per period (34, 8, 79, 79, 73). While the mean is lower than the peak of ~123, the standard deviation is notably higher. On-hand inventory is currently high (305 units) due to delayed arrivals and the drop in demand after large orders were placed. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Current inventory (305 on-hand + 2 in-transit = 307) significantly exceeds the likely demand for the next 5 periods at the current mean. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the post-peak average, and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility (ranging from 8 to 79). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Period 19 onwards) average demand is 55 units, with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation ~32) compared to pre-peak (SD ~9).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The SKU is a pair of skinny denim trousers. History shows a major demand surge in May and early June, which has since loyalty-shifted into a more volatile but lower-volume post-peak regime. Demand over the last four periods (Periods 21-24) has been 79, 79, 73, and 49 respectively, averaging 70 units per week. This is slightly higher than the initial spring regime (approx. 50-60) but significantly lower than the May peak (107-139). Lead time has consistently stayed at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 256 units, which is quite high relative to the last four weeks of demand. We also have 87 units in transit. Given the profit ($19) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the backend targeting a ~95% service level is appropriate. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current post-peak regime's mean and volatility while excluding the extreme May spike, ensuring the base stock level adjusts to current consumption patterns and prevents further inventory bloat.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Period 21 onwards) demonstrates sustained demand averaging approx. 70 units with moderate volatility, distinct from the extreme May surge and the low early-July dip.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Looking at the SKU (Skinny Denim Trousers), we have moved past the significant May/June demand peak. Since Period 21 (July 1st), demand has stabilized into a post-peak regime with an average of approximately 66 units (samples: 79, 79, 73, 49, 51). Specifically, the last two periods (49 and 51 units) suggest the demand is tapering down towards the pre-peak spring levels (approx 45-50 units). Inventory levels are currently high (on-hand: 205) due to several periods (19-22) of large arrivals that coincided with declining demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have seen 5 periods of this post-peak stabilization, I will use N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture this shift. The goal is to allow inventory to naturally draw down without triggering excessive new orders, as the current on-hand plus pipeline (119 units) covers roughly 5-6 weeks of recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization confirmed (Periods 21-25): Mean demand has shifted to ~66 units per period, showing a decline from the mid-summer average of 70 towards late-spring levels of 50-55 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are in a post-peak demand regime for item 554450036 (Skinny Denim TRS). Recent demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) has been: 79, 79, 73, 49, 51, 91. This averages 70 units per period. The most recent demand of 91 units indicates that demand remains robustly higher than the pre-peak spring levels. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The inventory position shows 114 units on-hand and 182 units in-transit (orders from P23, P24, P25, P26). With a lead time of 4, our 'reorder point' (base stock) needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Using the recent 6-period regime (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current stabilized average of ~70 units while accounting for the higher volatility (SD ~17.5) observed in this phase compared to early spring. This helps maintain a high service level for this high-margin (Profit=$19, Holding=$1) denim item.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the Period 27 arrival of the Period 23 order. However, there is a clear demand regime shift occurring in August. Demand in Period 26 was 91 and in Period 27 was 106, compared to the July average of approximately 63. This upward trend suggests a late-summer/back-to-school surge for skinny denim. Current on-hand inventory is very low (10 units) after a high-demand period. While there are 278 units in-transit (orders from P24-P27), the next arrival (P24 order of 85 units) won't arrive until Period 28 conclude (visible in Period 29). To account for the recent surge and maintain a high service level (calculated q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), I am using N=5 for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the recent sharp increase (last 5 periods demand: 51, 91, 106, plus July's 49, 73) and N=7 for volatility (sigma_hat) to provide a wider buffer given the recent fluctuations (8 to 106). This sets a base stock level that accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26: Late-summer surge detected with demand increasing from ~63 to ~98 (+55%) over the last two periods (August 5 - August 12).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently experiencing a late-summer surge. Demand over the last three periods has been 91, 106, and 101 units, maintaining a sustained elevated average of approximately 100 units compared to the mid-summer average of 66. This corresponds with late August 'Back to School' or early fall fashion trends for trousers/denim. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after selling out in Period 28. Although 301 units are in-transit, the immediate target is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at this new regime. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 500 (100 units/period * 5 periods) to reflect the sustained high demand. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the increased volatility seen throughout the summer months while excluding the extreme outlier dip in Period 20. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals from Periods 23 and 24.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-summer demand regime confirmed: Periods 26-28 average demand is 99 units (91, 106, 101), representing a ~50% increase over the previous stable regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a late-summer high-demand regime, though Period 29 showed a dip to 56 units. The 4-period average for Periods 26-29 is 88.5 units, significantly higher than the mid-summer average of ~66. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (Period 25 order arrived in Period 29). I am setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime while acknowledging the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased variance observed during this surge (demand range 56 to 106). Current on-hand is 0, and pipeline inventory is 404, which is roughly 4.5 periods of the current mean demand, necessitating continued ordering to maintain service levels for the upcoming periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450036' (Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 26 (late August). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 91.6 units (91, 106, 101, 56, 104). The dip in Period 29 (56 units) appears to be an outlier or stock-out artifact, as demand returned to 104 in Period 30. We are currently experiencing stock-outs (on-hand is 0) despite significant arrivals, due to this sustained surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P26 order arriving in P30. To capture the current late-summer/early-autumn demand level and ensure sufficient base stock to cover demand during the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the regime from P26 onwards) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility in this peak period. This will help the OR backend calculate a higher base stock to improve service levels.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/Early-autumn demand regime confirmed (Periods 26-30): Mean demand sustained at ~92 units, significantly higher than the July average of ~66 units.

Over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), demand has been 91, 106, 101, 56, 104, 87, averaging 90.8 units per week. The drop to 56 in Period 29 appears to be an outlier or volatility rather than a trend reversal, as demand rebounded to 104 and 87. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (11 units) and there have been stockouts (P28-P30), meaning pipeline inventory must cover the demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand regime and its associated volatility since early August.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a sustained late-summer/early-autumn demand regime. For the period P26-P32, the average demand is 86.7 units per period. The most recent demand (P32) was 62 units, suggesting a slight cooling from the peak of ~100 units, but still significantly higher than the early summer average (~55-66). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P28 order arrived in P32). Pipeline inventory is very high (404 units), but with a 4-period lead time, we must maintain a high base stock to cover demand for the next 5 periods (Review + Lead). I will use a N=7 period window (P26-P32) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the higher demand levels seen since late August, while the high in-transit amount will naturally throttle large new orders to avoid overstock as demand begins to stabilize.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. We are in a high-demand late-summer/early-autumn regime that began around Period 26 (August 5). Demand has been volatile but sustained at a high level; the last few periods (P30-P33) saw demand values of 104, 87, 62, and 136, averaging approximately 97 units. This represents a significant increase from the pre-August average of ~66. In-transit inventory is high (316 units), but the current on-hand inventory is relatively low (56 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the latest arrival in Period 33 (ordered P29, arrived P33). I will continue to use the recent regime (last 8 periods since the shift) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels account for this sustained higher demand and volatility while avoiding over-stocking from the extreme single-period spike of 136.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (Periods 30-33) averages 97 units with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation ~31) compared to August, likely reflecting seasonal variability in the Divided collection.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Julia RW Skinny Denim) has shown significant seasonal variability. The September regime (Periods 30-33) averaged 97.25 units with a high standard deviation (approx. 31), compared to the August average of ~92 units. The most recent demand was 94 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the 'Divided Collection' branding, we are in a high-demand autumn period, though we must guard against the volatility seen in Period 33 (demand spike to 136). We have 84 units on-hand and 329 units in-transit. I will use the recent_N method with N=9 (covering the regime since late August) to capture the current mean and higher volatility, ensuring our base stock covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: September/Early-October demand regime (Periods 30-34) remains sustained with an average of ~97 units and high volatility (SD ~30), confirming a stable but variable autumn peak for this SKU.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Oct 14, 2019. The SKU is a 'Divided Collection' skinny denim trouser. Historical demand analysis shows a robust autumn regime starting around Period 26 (August). For the most recent 10 periods (P26-P35), demand has averaged 89.1 units with significant volatility (SD ~24). However, the specific autumn peak observed from Periods 30-34 averaged 96.6 units. Period 35 showed a relative dip to 53 units, but 'Divided' collection items often experience fluctuates in mid-October before potential late-season spikes. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P31 order arriving in P35). To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting ~95% service level), I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the overall autumn regime while tempering the extreme spikes from September, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat accordingly. This ensures current on-hand (103) and pipeline (390) are managed against expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Mid-October demand observation: Period 35 demand (53) dropped significantly below the September average of ~97; monitoring to see if the autumn peak is concluding or if this is transient volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $962.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' (Divided Collection) shows a clear shift in demand behavior as we move further into October. Period 35 demand (53) and Period 36 demand (57) are significantly lower and more stable than the September (Periods 30-33) average of approximately 97 units. This indicates the autumn peak has likely concluded, and demand is returning to a lower baseline similar to mid-summer or late-spring levels. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this cool-down (averaging 85 units, but trending sharply downwards). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Inventory position is healthy with 121 on-hand and 363 in-transit, so the OR backend will moderate ordering based on the lower mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 35: Autumn peak has subsided; mean demand decreased from ~97 units to ~55 units (Periods 35-36) as seasonality for the Divided denim collection cools down for late October.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1532.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late October (2019/10/28). The SKU 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' has exited its autumn peak. As noted in the carry-over insight for Period 37, demand has shifted significantly lower from the ~97 average seen in September/early October. The last three periods (35, 36, 37) show demands of 53, 57, and 85, averaging 65 units. This is a clear cooling trend as we move towards November. Given the pipeline inventory is quite high (400 units in transit), and the on-hand inventory is 83, the primary goal is to avoid overstocking while adjusting to this lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the immediate post-peak demand levels (~65 units) and current volatility, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current regime rather than the higher autumn averages.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak demand regime (Period 35 onwards) confirmed: average demand has stabilized at ~65 units (Periods 35-37: 53, 57, 85), significantly lower than the ~97 observed in September.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450036 (Julia RW Skinny Denim) is currently in a post-autumn peak phase. Period 38 demand (91) was higher than the previous two periods (53, 57, 85), but the overall trend since Period 35 shows a decrease from the September peak (avg ~97) to a new mean around 71.5 units (Periods 35-38: 53, 57, 85, 91). With on-hand inventory at 127 and in-transit at 265 units, the pipeline is well-stocked. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by Period 38 arrival of the Period 34 order). To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (SD ~18 over the last 4 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the post-peak mean. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the current regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak demand regime (Period 35 onwards) average demand is ~72 units (Periods 35-38: 53, 57, 85, 91) with moderate volatility, significantly lower than the ~97 observed in September.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The SKU is Julia RW Skinny Denim from the Divided Collection. Following the autumn peak (which averaged ~97 units in September), demand has shifted into a new, lower regime starting Period 35. Over the last five periods (P35-P39), the demand has been 53, 57, 85, 91, and 57. The average for this recent period is approximately 68.6 units. This is consistent with the 'post-autumn peak' insight. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. With on-hand inventory at 203 units and in-transit at 169 units (total pipeline = 372), the stock level is healthy. I will use a five-period window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime while acknowledging significant week-to-week volatility (SD in this regime is approx 18.5).

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak demand regime (Period 35 onwards) stabilized: 5-period average (P35-P39) is 68.6 units, significantly lower than the ~97 observed in September, with moderate volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a post-autumn peak regime where demand for this Divided skinny denim SKU has stabilized. The last 6 periods (P35-P40) show demands of 53, 57, 85, 91, 57, and 81, averaging 70.7 units per period. This is significantly lower than the September average of ~97. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Inventory is currently healthy with 170 on-hand and 158 in-transit. Given the moderate volatility in this regime (standard deviation ~16), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this stabilized post-peak level, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect the current variability. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed 4-period lead time matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak demand regime (Period 35 onwards) average stabilized at ~71 units (P35-P40: 53, 57, 85, 91, 57, 81) with moderate volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-25. The SKU is a 'Divided' collection skinny denim. Based on the history, we are in a post-autumn peak regime that began around Period 35 (early October). Over the last seven periods (P35-P41), demand has averaged 70.4 units (53, 57, 85, 91, 57, 81, 69) with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. This is significantly lower and less volatile than the September peak (~97 units, SD ~30). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P31 through P37. Given the current high on-hand (185) and in-transit (162) inventory totaling 347 units, and an expected total demand over the lead time + review period (5 periods) of approximately 352 units (5 * 70.4), we are well-stocked. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this post-peak stabilization while allowing for moderate volatility in the OR calculation.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), we observed a significant demand spike of 268 units, which likely corresponds to 'Black Friday' sales given the date (2019/11/25). This exhausted the on-hand inventory. History shows that similar spikes in this SKU (like the mid-May surge) are often followed by a sharp return to baseline levels or high volatility. The 5-period average prior to this spike was ~71 units. To account for this seasonality without over-ordering for a potential post-holiday slump, I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8), which includes both the current spike and the preceding baseline (~90 units/period). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=8) to capture the increased volatility introduced by the holiday surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected Period 42 (268 units), coinciding with Black Friday; monitoring to determine if this is a transient event or a sustained holiday regime change.

Daily Reward (R_t): $703.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent Period 42 demand spike (268 units) was triggered by Black Friday (Nov 29). Based on historical patterns after major events (like the mid-May surge), demand typically settles back towards the established mean. For Periods 35-43 (excluding the Black Friday outlier), the mean demand is approximately 71 units. I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 9 (P35-P43) which captures the post-autumn regime and the recent spike, but the OR backend's capping mechanism and current pipeline will moderate the order. Period 43 order (213) is already in transit. Current on-hand is 0 due to the holiday surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Note: The Period 38 order (0 units) should have arrived in Period 42 but effectively contributes nothing to current stock, explaining the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday surge confirmed Period 42 (268 units). Early December demand (Period 43: 71 units) signals a return to the post-autumn baseline of ~71 units rather than a sustained holiday regime shift.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has returned to its post-autumn baseline of approximately 71 units after the Black Friday (Period 42) spike. My current on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in Periods 43 and 44, necessitated by the transient surge. I have 566 units in-transit, which includes the significant catching-up orders placed in Periods 43 and 44. Since the Black Friday surge did not result in a sustained holiday regime change (Period 43 and 44 demand was ~70), I am setting mu_hat using the recent 10-period average (N=10) to capture the stable ~71 unit trend while discounting the extreme outlier of Period 42. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P45, P46, P47), the pipeline of 566 units (ordered in P41-P44) is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Thus, the OR backend logic will likely result in zero or minimal ordering to avoid ending with excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1532.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), following the Black Friday spike (P42: 268 units) and subsequent return to a baseline demand. Over the last three standard periods (P43-P45), demand has been 71, 70, and 81 units, yielding an average of ~74 units. This aligns with the post-autumn peak regime of ~71 units noted in earlier insights. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P41 order in P45. However, there is a significant discrepancy: the order from Period 38 (placed Oct 28) has not arrived. Since orders from P39, P40, and P41 have successfully arrived on schedule (LT=4), the P38 order (135 units) is considered lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 598 accounts for orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45. To ensure sufficient stock for the remaining 2 periods of the game and to protect against the moderate volatility (Standard Deviation ~10-15 in stable periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the current post-holiday baseline, and sigma_hat using a broader window (N=10) to account for recent variance including the late-autumn shifts.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Period 38 order (135 units) confirmed lost; subsequent orders (P39-P41) arrived correctly on 4-period lead time. Demand stabilized post-Black Friday at ~74 units (P43-P45).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 30, post-holiday season. Demand has returned to the post-autumn baseline following the Black Friday spike. Looking at Periods 43-46, demand values were 71, 70, 81, and 54, averaging 69 units. This aligns with the 'post-autumn baseline' of ~71 units identified in Carry-over Insights (Period 41). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the P38 order confirmed lost and subsequent orders (P39-P42) arriving as expected. Currently, on-hand is low (15) but in-transit is high (536), covering the P43-P45 restock orders. For Period 47, I'll use a recent window (N=5) to capture the stabilized mean of ~69 and account for the observed volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P46) has stabilized at an average of 69 units, confirming a return to the late-autumn baseline.
