Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we have no lead time history or 'conclude' messages to evaluate. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple superstretch denim item. Historical demand (5 samples) shows a slight upward trend (694 to 774). Given the current date is Feb 11th, we are approaching the spring season which often sees increased demand for denim/trousers as people refresh wardrobes. The average demand across the 5 samples is 688.4 units. Since we start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit, and the lead time is L=4 (covering L+1=5 periods), the goal is to establish a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent levels while we wait for lead time confirmation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple apparel item (denim trousers). Historical demand data shows a stable range between 576 and 774 units. In Period 1, we ordered 808 units, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and lost 671 units of demand in Period 1 (stockout). We have 808 units in transit. The demand mean of the 5 historical samples provided (694, 576, 685, 715, 774) is 688.8. For Period 2, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this recent baseline. For sigma_hat, I'll use N=5 to reflect the historical volatility (std \u2248 72.8). Since we have no concluded lead time data yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (4). The parameters are set to rebuild safety stock and cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a super-skinny high-waisted denim trouser. Historical demand samples (Jan/Feb) show a mean of ~688 units/week. Recent demand in P1 (671) and P2 (673) is consistent with this. Current on-hand is 0, because the orders from P1 (808 units) and P2 (804 units) have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at P3, the first order (P1) is not expected until arrival resolution in P5 (visible in P6). There is no evidence yet to suggest lead time drift or lost shipments. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (3 historical + P1-P2) to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 688 per week). With L=4, mu_hat should cover 5 periods (L+1). mu_hat explicit = 688 * 5 = 3440. Sigma_hat is calculated to handle the standard deviation over the lead time plus review period.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 4 (2019/3/4), the SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is in a complete stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand in the first three periods (671, 673, 539) has been consistently missed due to zero starting inventory. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are in Period 4, the first order (placed in Period 1) is not expected to arrive until the end of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Total in-transit inventory is 2,387 units (808+804+775). Including the initial demand samples provided (694, 576, 685, 715, 774), the demand is fairly stable around a mean of ~660. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to account for all available history, as there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or lead time deviation. Our goal is to maintain the pipeline to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a year-round staple with some potential for seasonal variation in spring. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to significant lost sales. We have orders in-transit from Periods 1 to 4 (Total 3177 units). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) arrives during Period 5's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which we will see at the start of Period 6). Therefore, current arrivals are on schedule so far. Historical baseline demand from the user-provided pre-game data (Jan-Feb) was approx 688/week. Recent demand (last 4 periods) has trended downward: 671, 673, 539, 447 (Average: 582). I will use recent_N=4 to set mu_hat to capture this recent trend while expecting the in-transit inventory to satisfy demand once it arrives starting next period. L is set to default as we haven't confirmed any lead time deviations yet.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim (fashion staple). Period 5 concluded with the first arrival of 808 units from Period 1, confirming the actual lead time L=4 (matching promised). Historical demand samples (including pre-game) show: 694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673, 539, 447, 468. There is a visible downward trend or shift in demand starting around P3-P5 (avg ~485) compared to P1-P2 and pre-game data (avg ~680). This decrease might be due to the product moving past a peak seasonal phase. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent lower demand regime (avg 567) while maintaining enough buffer for variance. With 340 on-hand and 2509 in-transit, we are heavily overstocked relative to current demand (~2800 units pending vs ~500 weekly demand across L+1=5 periods), but the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage the base stock level. I'll maintain 'default' for L since it's confirmed at 4.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim (Trousers). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Demand has decreased since February: Feb 11-25 avg was ~627 and Mar 4-18 avg is ~472 (-25%). This suggests a post-winter or early spring demand settling. Currently, on-hand is 642 and in-transit is 2052, representing over 4 periods of safety at current demand levels. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this lower March demand level (avg ~472) to avoid over-ordering and high holding costs. Lead time remains at the default promised/observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in March: mean decreased from ~627 (Feb) to ~472 (Mar), a reduction of approx 25%.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS. Based on the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 1 order arrived in P5, P2 in P6, P3 in P7). Demand analysis shows a clear shift: Feb demand (P1-P2 + historical) averaged ~680, but March demand (P3-P7) dropped significantly, averaging ~493. This represents a ~28% decrease. On-hand inventory is currently high (906) and 1277 units are in transit (orders from P4, P5, P6). The P4 order (790 units) is expected to arrive this period (P8), which will likely push inventory above desired levels. To prevent overstocking during this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (P3-P7) to reflect the recent ~493 mean. I will use the default lead time calculation since it aligns with observations.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim (High-waisted jeans), a staple item. Demand analysis: Feb (P1-P3) average was ~627. Mar (P4-P7) saw a decline to ~482. However, the last two periods (P7-P8) show demand rebounding (511, 560), likely due to spring seasonality for denim. Lead time analysis: All observed arrivals (P5-P8) confirm a stable lead time of exactly 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory: We have 1136 on-hand and 905 in-transit (orders from P5: 140, P6: 347, P8: 418). The P7 order was 0. Given the recent upward trend in April, I will use recent_N=4 for demand to capture the March-to-April shift while filtering the higher Feb numbers. For L, I use 'calculate' as it has been perfectly consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebounded in early April (P7-P8) to average ~535, up from the March average of ~482 (+11%), indicating the March dip has ended. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019. We are managing high-waisted denim trousers. Demand history shows a seasonal dip in March (approx 482 units/week) and a recovery in April. However, the most recent demand (Period 9) was 335, which is lower than expected after the 511 and 560 seen in Periods 7 and 8. Averaging the available 2019 samples (excluding initial seed data which are much higher) gives a mean of approximately 505. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 941 units on hand and 1,338 in transit, current stock is sufficient to cover the 5-period window (L+1) at current rates. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the April rebound while balancing the lower Period 9 observation. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4092.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' SKU is experiencing a significant downward demand trend. Although early April showed a slight rebound (~535), the last two periods (P9 and P10) have dropped sharply to 335 and 269 respectively. This suggests the early April rally was transient or that a new lower-demand regime is settling in for late April. The current on-hand inventory (1019) plus in-transit (1401) totals 2420 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand (269). To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a safeguard for the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat to capture the recent lower demand trend using N=5. This includes the April periods and better reflects the current trajectory compared to the high February samples. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, so 'default' is used.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in late April: demand dropped significantly in P9-P10 (avg 302) compared to early April (avg 535), a decrease of over 40%.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/29. We are in a significant low-demand regime that began in late April (P9-P11). The average demand over the last 3 periods is approx 288 (335, 269, 261), which is a sharp 40%+ drop from the early April average (~535). On-hand inventory is 758 and In-transit is 1622, totaling 2380 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With current demand levels, our total pipeline (2380) covers roughly 8 periods of demand, making the current position overstocked given the demand shift. The Period 11 'arrived=0' message is expected because the Period 7 order (which had 0 units) was due to arrive during Period 11. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been perfectly stable at 4. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand regime (approx 288/week), which allows the OR backend to scale down orders to avoid further excess holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: late April (P9-P11) average dropped to 288, down from early April average of 535 (-46%).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim) is currently in a low-demand regime. After a significant drop in late April (periods 9-11), demand in Period 12 was 339, which is slightly higher than the preceding three periods (avg 288) but still far below the early April average (~535). Seasonal patterns for skinny denim often see a dip as warmer weather approaches in May. We remain in a state of high inventory (On-hand: 837, In-transit: 1204), while the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) at current rates is only around 1,500 units. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 8 order in Period 12. Therefore, I am using recent_N=4 to capture the current lower demand level (approx 301 units/week) to prevent further overstocking and minimize holding costs while the lead time is set to default (promised 4).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-13. The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has settled into a lower regime since late April. Over the last five periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged 289 units (335, 269, 261, 339, 241), which is a significant drop from the earlier April and March levels. On-hand inventory is currently high at 1,169 units, and 631 units are in-transit (410 from P10 and 221 from P11), totaling 1,800 units of pipeline inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the low demand regime and high existing inventory (covering approx 6 weeks of demand at the current rate), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture this lower volume accurately and prevent further overstocking. The OR backend will see that (base_stock - pipeline) is likely negative, correctly suppressing new orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level: P9-P13 average demand is 289 units, confirming a sustained ~45% reduction from early April peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2201.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), demand for the high-waisted denim trousers continues to decline as we move further into late spring/early summer. The 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' belongs to the Divided Collection, which often sees faster trend shifts. Demand for the most recent 3 periods (P12-14) averaged 256 units (339, 241, 189), confirming an ongoing downward trend from the previous regime average of ~300. P14 demand was particularly low at 189 units. On-hand inventory is currently very high (1390 units), which covers over five periods of expected future demand at the current average rate. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P14 arrived on time). To account for the continuing softening of demand and prevent excessive holding costs given the current inventory surplus, I will transition mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to represent the most recent 6-period regime (P9-P14), which captures the step-down into the current low-demand environment (average ~272). L will remain at 'calculate' to reflect the observed stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand continues to soften in late May: P12-P14 average demand dropped to 256 units compared to the P9-P11 average of 288 units (-11%), marking a sustained low-demand regime for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5889.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained low-demand regime. Analyzing recent history: the average demand over the last 7 periods (P9-P15) is approximately 287 units. The most recent three periods (P13-P15) averaged 268 units, confirming that demand has stabilized at a much lower level than during the February/March peak. My current inventory level is 1236 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). My current stock (1236) divided by the recent average (268-287) represents over 4 periods of coverage. Since the OR backend calculates a base stock to cover (L+1) periods, and my inventory is already high relative to the new demand regime, I need to adjust mu_hat to reflect the lower demand to avoid further overstocking and high holding costs. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture this lower volume, and use recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the reduced volatility in this regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd. Recent demand in Period 16 spiked significantly to 533 units, following a period of lower demand (P12-15 avg ~286). This suggests a potential rebound or early summer peak for skinny denim trousers. On-hand inventory is 703 units, which is healthy, but we need to account for this new higher demand level. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (except for an order from P7 that never arrived/concluded). Given the sharp increase in Period 16, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 (P12-16) to capture the blend of recent low demand and the latest spike, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 335 units per period. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility caused by the P16 spike. L remains at default (4) as the historical arrivals confirm this lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected in late May/early June: P16 demand (533) is 86% higher than the P12-P15 average (286), suggesting a shift away from the low-demand May regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. Demand context shows a clear rebound after a sustained low-demand period in May. Period 16 demand was 533 and Period 17 demand was 451. This averages to 492, which is significantly higher than the previous low regime (avg 286). This shift mirrors the seasonal rise seen in the pre-history and February data for this SKU (skinny denim). The order for Period 7 (value: 0) was 'lost' or skipped, but other shipments from Period 5-11 arrived with a consistent lead time of 4. Note that shipments from Period 12-15 were not placed (0 units), which explains the lack of arrivals in Periods 16-17. I am setting L to default (4), and adjusting mu_hat to use the most recent 2 periods (N=2) to capture the current demand rebound and avoid anchoring to the low May volumes. Sigma_hat is also set to N=3 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from June confirmed: P16-P17 average demand (492) is 72% higher than the P12-P15 average (286), indicating a shift back to higher demand levels seen earlier in the year.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). The SKU (706016001 - Jade HW Skinny Denim) is experiencing a significant demand rebound that began in Period 16. Current demand levels (P16-P18: 533, 451, 462) average 482 units, compared to the May low of ~286. I am currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) and experienced lost sales in Period 18. Stockouts occurred because no orders arrived in P16-P18; specifically, the order from P12 was missed/lost (or delayed significantly), as P12's order was 0, and no units arrived in P16 or P17. The pipeline contains 1572 units (P16: 395, P17: 555, P18: 622). The P16 order is expected to arrive this period (P19) based on L=3 (if lead time is constant) or L=4 (promised). Looking at history, lead times from P1 to P11 was consistently 4 periods. However, the system shows that the order from P12 was 0, so no arrival in P16 was expected. The order from P13 (also 0) means no arrival in P17 was expected. The order from P14 (also 0) means no arrival in P18 was expected. Thus, the stockout is a result of zero orders being placed during the low-demand regime in May (P12-P14), which has left a gap in the supply chain now that demand has rebounded. To recover, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the higher demand regime, and L to calculate to handle the observed lead time stability (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from June sustained: P16-P18 average demand (482 units) confirmed. Stockout in P18 due to zero orders placed in P12-P14 during the previous low-demand regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 20 (late June). Demand for this denim SKU has entered a higher-demand regime since late May (P16), with average demand over the last 4 visible periods (P16-P19) being approximately 451 units, excluding the stockout-suppressed sales. This is a significant rebound from the May low (approx 250-280 units). We are experiencing a stockout because no orders were placed in periods 12-15 due to the previous low-demand signal. Inventory is currently zero, with 2128 units in-transit. The in-transit units are from orders placed in P16-P19 (395+555+622+556 = 2128). Based on historical data (P5-P15), the lead time has been consistently 4 periods. The P16 order (395 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of this period (P20), which will alleviate the stockout starting in P21. I will set the lead time to 4 (promised) and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current June demand regime (approx 450 units/week), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained June demand regime confirmed: P16-P19 average demand stabilized at ~450 units per week, significantly higher than the May average of ~260.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. We have entered a sustained higher-demand regime since early June (averaging ~414 units over P16-P20, despite a slight dip in P20). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P16 order in P20. There was a significant stockout gap from P18-P19 due to zero ordering during the May low-demand phase (P12-P15), which has now been resolved by the P16 arrival. Pipeline inventory (2125 units) is healthy, consisting of orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20. To ensure we maintain stock for the current demand level (~414 units/week) over the (L+1)=5 period horizon, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the June/July regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach balances the need to cover the current demand while acknowledging the volatility seen in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized for July: P16-P20 average demand is ~414 units, confirming a shift from the May low (~260) to a sustained summer level.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical demand for this skinny denim SKU shows a significant rebound from the May lows (~260) to a more stable summer regime starting in late June. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has averaged 403.6 units, though there was some volatility in June. The stockout observed in P18-P19 was caused by zero orders placed during the May low-demand period (P12-P15), which has now been resolved as orders from the June recovery (P16 and P17) have begun arriving at the promised lead time of 4 periods. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. I will use the most recent 6 periods (N=6) of demand to capture the current summer regime while smoothing out the minor fluctuations seen in late June/early July. This sets the base stock level to cover current stabilized demand levels while the pipeline (1767 units) replenishes the inventory depleted during the stockout.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has reached a stable summer demand regime after recovering from a significant low in May. Recent demand history shows: P19(358), P20(265), P21(353), P22(393). The average demand over the last four periods (P19-P22) is approximately 342 units per week, which is lower than the initial June rebound (avg 450) but higher than the May lows. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P22 conclude showed a P18 order arriving with LT=4). On-hand inventory is 561 units, and we have a large pipeline of 1419 units (ordered P19-P22) which will start arriving from next period (P23). Since demand appears to have slightly softened from the initial June spike but remained stable around 340-350 in the last two weeks, I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent stability against the earlier spike to ensure we don't over-order given the high pipeline inventory. L is set to calculated as lead times have been consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: July demand stabilized around 340-360 units per week (P21-P22), slightly lower than the initial June surge of 450 but significantly above May lows.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny jeans) is currently in a stable summer demand regime (July). Demand over the last three periods (P21-P23) has been 353, 393, and 369 units respectively, averaging 372 units. This is slightly lower than the initial June surge of ~450 but remains much higher than the May lows of ~260. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P16 through P19 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 748, and there are 863 units in various stages of transit (ordered in P20, P21, P22). To maintain appropriate stock for the current (L+1) window, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering P19-P23) which captures the current stabilized demand level of approximately 348 units per week (avg of 358, 265, 353, 393, 369). This prevents overstocking while ensuring enough buffer for late July/early August sales.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Historical demand for July (P21-P24) has been 353, 393, 369, and 232 units respectively. While the most recent period (P24) showed a drop to 232, the 'Carry-over Insights' indicate a stabilization around 340-360 units for July. The sharp drop in P24 might be a weekly fluctuation or the beginning of a late-summer trend change, but I will lean towards the recent month's average to avoid overreacting to a single data point while still acknowledging the softening. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 908 and in-transit at 778 (total pipeline = 1686), and an expected demand of ~340 per period, we have approximately 5 periods of coverage. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (P20-P24) to capture the recent stabilization and the latest dip, providing a balanced forecast for the OR backend.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Demand for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 329 units (353, 393, 369, 232, 298), which indicates a stabilization or slight cooling compared to the June peak of ~450, but it remains significantly higher than the May lows (~260). The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P20-P25). On-hand inventory is 807, and in-transit is 765 (orders from P22, P24, and P25). To maintain optimal stock for the current demand regime while accounting for the 4-period lead time (covering L+1 = 5 periods), I will use a recent_N approach. N=5 is chosen because it captures the most recent demand behavior post-June surge, reflecting the current 'late summer' stable regime. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~330 units per week over the lead time plus review period without overstocking as we move further into August.

Carry-over insight: August demand regime: P21-P25 average demand is ~330 units, reflecting a stable late summer level lower than the June surge (~450) but higher than May lows (~260).

The current date is August 12, 2019. Inventory is stable with 700 units on hand and 802 in transit. Recent demand (P21-P26: 353, 393, 369, 232, 298, 381) shows a fairly stable late summer level. The average demand over the last 6 periods (since the July stabilization noted in carry-over insights) is approximately 338 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P22-P26). I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this current stable regime, and calculate for L to leverage the consistent historical performance of the 4-period lead time.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is exhibiting a demand increase as we move into late August (Period 27 demand was 493, up from the Period 21-25 average of ~330). This represents a 49% increase over the previous stable regime, likely signaling the start of the 'Back to School' peak for this denim product. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods based on historical conclusions (e.g., Period 22 order arrived in Period 26). I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent window of 3 periods to capture this upward shift while maintaining the standard safety stock calculation. The zero arrival noted in Period 27 is expected as no order was placed in Period 23; there are no signs of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in mid-August (Period 27): demand increased to 493 units, a 49% increase over the previous late-summer average (~330), likely reflecting Back-to-School seasonality.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (high-waisted skinny jeans) is entering the peak 'Back-to-School' season in late August (Period 29, Date: 2019/8/26). A significant demand surge was detected in Period 27 (493 units) and sustained in Period 28 (432 units), representing a ~40% increase over the previous summer average (~330). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (82 units) while substantial stock is in-transit (1460 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level. To capture the current seasonal regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 periods (P26-P28) where demand averaged 435 units, ensuring the system orders enough to cover the elevated autumn demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand surge confirmed in late August: Period 27-28 average demand is 462 units, a 40% increase over the early August average (~330).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a 'Back-to-School' demand surge which began in mid-August (Period 27). Over the last three periods (P27-P29), demand has averaged 440 units, compared to the early August average of ~330 (+33%). The stockout in Period 29 was caused by limited arrivals (184 units) which failed to meet the elevated demand (396 units), leaving 0 on-hand inventory. Given the date (Early September), this high demand level is expected to persist through the academic start season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts while inventory is replenished by the 1804 units in-transit, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this heightened demand regime and increase the base stock level accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5909.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing a significant demand surge associated with the late August/early September Back-to-School season. Recent demand in Period 30 spiked to 740 units, following a period of 493 and 432 units. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P27-P30) is approximately 515 units, compared to the previous summer average of ~330. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts (P29-P30), indicating that recent ordering levels were insufficient for this peak. While there are 2014 units in-transit, the immediate priority is to set parameters that reflect the current high-demand regime to ensure the base stock covers upcoming demand once arrivals resume. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) centers the forecast on the current surge (approx 515 * 5 = 2575).

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: Period 30 demand reached 740 units, bringing the late-August/early-September (P27-P30) average to ~515 units, a 56% increase over the summer average (~330). Sustained stockouts in P29-P30.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant demand surge consistent with Back-to-School and early autumn seasonality. Period 30 and 31 demand reached 740 and 708 units respectively, a sharp increase from the summer average (~330). This has led to stockouts in Periods 29, 30, and 31. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The confirmed lead time remains 4 periods. To address this sustained high-demand regime, I am shifting the forecasting window to the last 5 periods (P27-P31), which captures the start and progression of this surge. The average demand in this 5-period window is approximately 554 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 will adjust the base stock to cover this higher volume (554 * 5 = 2770) across the lead time and review period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with this surge, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to mitigate further stockouts during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge sustained: Period 30-31 average demand is 724 units, representing the peak of the autumn regime and significantly exceeding the late-August average of 462.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a high-demand peak centered around the September 'Back-to-School' and autumn transition. For the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has consistently exceeded 700 units (740, 708, 707), leading to stockouts despite arrivals. The current average demand over this new peak regime (P30-P32) is approximately 718 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on this most recent high-demand regime (N=3) to ensure the base stock levels are calculated against the current 700+ unit weekly requirement. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this recent period to capture the volatility of the peak. This will signal the OR backend to place aggressive orders to mitigate the current on-hand deficit and cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: September peak demand confirmed and stable: Period 30-32 demand averaged 718 units, a significant sustained increase compared to the August average (~330-460).

Daily Reward (R_t): $10032.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is experiencing a massive seasonal demand surge in late September, likely tied to autumn fashion shifts. Period 33 demand was 1428, nearly doubling the previous records of ~700. The current on-hand inventory is 0. However, the pipeline is very full with 2859 units in transit due to high orders in Periods 31-33. The September 'peak' average from P30-P33 (including the outlier) is approximately 895 units per week. While 1428 is a significant spike, I must balance the risk of over-ordering if this was an isolated peak against the danger of continued stockouts. I will use the last 4 periods (P30-P33) to set mu_hat, which results in a weekly average of ~895.8. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: September peak demand intensified in Period 33: demand reached 1428 units, bringing the P30-P33 average to ~896 units, a significant jump from the earlier September average of ~718 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand regime, likely driven by autumn seasonality (September/October). While demand spiked significantly in Period 33 (1428 units), it returned to a lower but still elevated level in Period 34 (748 units). I am calculating mu_hat based on the average of the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34: 740, 708, 707, 1428, 748), which averages 866 units per week. This captures the current surge while acknowledging the extreme P33 outlier. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the current high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages. The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory due to sustained stockouts, so I am setting parameters to aggressive levels (L+1 = 5 weeks of coverage) to capture as much of this high-demand period as possible, while the backend's 'cap' mechanism will help prevent excessive over-ordering if demand suddenly drops.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand regime shift confirmed: demand averaged 866 units over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), which is more than double the August average (~330-460).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn regime, with demand averaging approximately 866 units over the last five periods (P31-P35). While Period 35 demand (606) was lower than the extreme peak in Period 33 (1428), it remains significantly elevated compared to summer levels (~330). On-hand inventory is low (165) following a string of stockouts, but a large pipeline (4473 units) is expected to arrive starting this period to cover the peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this sustained high-demand regime while allowing for the slight moderation observed in the most recent week. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility seen during this peak period. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: October demand remains in a high-demand regime: P31-P35 average demand is 845 units, despite a lower P35 value (606), compared to the pre-peak August average (~330).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime following the September peak. While demand has slightly stabilized from the late-September peak (1428 units), the average demand over the last four periods (P33-P36) remains high at approximately 840 units. The transition into October shows demand levels of 606 (P35) and 581 (P36), which are lower than the September peaks but still significantly elevated compared to August levels. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this entire 'Autumn' high-demand phase (P31-P36), which averages approximately 796 units per period. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using this recent high-demand window ensures the OR engine maintains enough stock for the sustained elevated interest in this Divided denim product while accounting for the recent tapering from the absolute peak.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime shift: demand has moderated from September peaks (~1000+) to a stable high level of ~600 units (P35-P36), representing a 40% reduction from peak but still double the summer baseline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the Period 33 order arriving in Period 37. Demand has transitioned from the extreme September peaks (~900-1400) to a more moderate but still high October regime. Over the last three periods (P35-P37), demand has been 606, 581, and 643, averaging 610 units. This is significantly higher than the summer baseline (~330) but lower than the September surge. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to anchor the forecast to this current stable October level (approx 610 units per week). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to capture the reduced volatility compared to the September spike period. This strategy aims to maintain sufficient stock for the current demand level without over-ordering based on the now-passed September peak.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime stabilized: Period 35-37 average demand is 610 units, representing a 32% decrease from the September peak average (~896) but remaining nearly double the summer baseline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) has entered a stable post-peak regime in October/November. Over the last four periods (P35-P38), demand has been consistently around 600-660 units (avg 623), which is lower than the September peak (~900-1400) but sustains a high baseline compared to summer. In Period 38, a large order of 1,522 units (from the P34 peak adjustment) arrived, significantly increasing on-hand inventory to 1,367 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand and in-transit inventory (total pipeline ~3,839 units), and a forecast of ~623 units per week, the current stock covers more than 6 weeks of demand (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this stabilized ~625 unit regime, while maintaining default lead time and sigma calculations. The OR backend will likely recommend a small or zero order this period to normalize the inventory levels after the large P34 arrival.

Carry-over insight: October/November demand regime stabilized: Period 35-38 average demand is 623 units, confirming a consistent high-demand plateau following the September peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized at a high-demand plateau following the September peak. Over the last four periods (P35-P38), demand has averaged 599 units (606, 581, 643, 663), and the most recent period (P39) was 485 units, maintaining an average of approximately 600 units (mean of P35-P39 = 576). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (2266 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the September peak (P34 and P35). With an expected weekly demand of ~600 and a 4-period lead time, the required base stock (covering L+1 periods) is roughly 3000 units. Current total inventory (on-hand 2266 + in-transit 1088) is 3354 units, which is sufficient. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this 'post-peak' plateau of ~600 units, and use a similar window for sigma_hat to account for the stabilized volatility.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime: Period 35-39 average demand is 576 units, confirming a stable high-level plateau significantly above the summer baseline (~330) but below the September peak (~900).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Inventory is high (on-hand 2470) following significant arrivals from large orders placed during the September/October demand peak. Demand has stabilized into a late autumn regime (November avg ~576), which is significantly lower than the September peak (~900) but consistent. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given high on-hand levels and the pipeline inventory (303 units arriving from Period 37), the system currently holds enough stock to cover the next several periods without further ordering. To prevent unnecessary holding costs, I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent demand moderation (P36-P40 avg is 591) and use 'calculate' for lead time to maintain the observed 4-period consistency. This will allow the base stock calculation to align with the current lower demand plateau.

Carry-over insight: November demand plateau confirmed: Period 36-40 average demand is 591 units, showing a stable regime below September peaks but above the summer baseline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 42 (late November). Demand has stabilized into a consistent plateau following the September peak. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has averaged 584 units, reinforcing the insight that we are in a steady high-demand regime significantly above the summer baseline (~330) but well below the extreme September volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (2226 units) due to the large orders placed during the September peak arriving now. However, most of those peak-period orders have already arrived. We need to maintain a base stock that covers the next 5 periods (L+1) at the current plateau rate (~584 units/period). With on-hand plus in-transit totaling 2662 units, and expected demand over 5 periods being approximately 2920 units, we are slightly below the ideal base stock level but protected by the OR backend's safety stock calculations. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized November plateau and ignore the earlier extreme September spikes which would otherwise inflate our inventory targets unnecessarily as we approach the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: November plateau stabilized: P37-P41 average demand is 584 units, confirming a consistent regime shift from the September peaks down to a stable late-autumn level.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), we observed a massive demand spike to 3,100 units, which far exceeded on-hand inventory, resulting in a stockout. This spike is highly likely related to Black Friday/Cyber Monday (late November) seasonality for a 'Divided Collection' denim product. Historically, after the September peak (~900 avg), demand stabilized around 580-600 units. The jump to 3100 is a 5x increase over that plateau. For Period 43 (early December), I expect demand to remain elevated due to holiday shopping/post-Cyber Monday tail but likely pull back from the extreme Black Friday peak. Given the on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline is 959 (from P41 and P42 orders), I need to set mu_hat significantly higher than the baseline to trigger the OR backend to replenish aggressively. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on an estimated 1,200 units/week for the review+lead period (L+1=5), totaling 6,000, to ensure the base stock covers potential December demand. Sigma_hat is also set higher to account for the extreme volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand surge confirmed in Period 42: demand reached 3,100 units, a 5x increase over the November plateau (~580). Period 43 enters the December holiday regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we experienced a massive Black Friday surge (3,100 units), which completely depleted our 2,226 units of on-hand inventory. Period 43 (Dec 2) shows a demand of 674 units, which we could not satisfy (stockout), but it indicates that demand has returned to a level slightly above the November plateau (~580) but significantly below the BFCM peak. We currently have 0 on-hand and 3,263 units in-transit. The orders from P38-P40 were 0, explaining why no arrivals occurred in P42-43. Arrivals are expected to resume in P45 (from the P41 order). Given we are in the December holiday season, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent post-peak demand (Period 43) using an explicit value to ensure we account for December's elevated baseline compared to the summer. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: December holiday regime: Period 43 demand (674) suggests a post-Black Friday baseline approximately 15% higher than the November plateau (~580).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday shopping period (Period 45). Demand patterns show a massive Black Friday spike in Period 42 (3,100 units), followed by a stabilized December baseline of ~677 units (average of P43-P44). The stockout in P42-P44 is due to zero orders being placed during the P38-P40 window when inventory was high, combined with the extreme Black Friday draw. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P37 order arrived P41). I will set L to 4 as promised. For mu_hat, I will use the recent_N method with N=2 to capture the post-Black Friday December demand level (avg 677). This results in a forecast of (1+4) * 677 = 3385. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to include the high volatility seen during the November/December transition while excluding the extreme Black Friday outlier, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock without over-reacting to the singular BF spike.

Carry-over insight: December holiday baseline established: Period 43-44 demand average of 677 units is approx 15% higher than the November plateau (~580).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the pre-Christmas week (Period 46, Dec 23). Historical data and carry-over insights show a December holiday baseline of ~677 units (P43-P44), which is roughly 15% higher than the November plateau. However, Period 45 demand remains elevated at 657 units despite a stockout, suggesting actual potential demand is likely closer to the 680-700 range. On-hand inventory is 0, and we are currently experiencing stockouts due to the massive Black Friday surge (3,100 units in P42) which depleted safety stocks. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, the OR engine needs to cover 5 periods of demand (Review + Lead Time). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the post-Black Friday holiday regime (P43-P45), which averages 670 units per period. This results in a mu_hat of ~3350. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent demand volatility during the holiday season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8977.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (2019/12/30), we are in the post-holiday period. Demand for skinney denim trousers peaked during Black Friday (P42: 3,100 units) and settled into a December baseline of ~677 units (P43-P44). Period 46 showed a drop to 475 units, which is typical for the week before/of Christmas as shopping concludes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P42 order arriving in P46. Current on-hand is low (48), but the pipeline is massive (5,493 units) due to large orders placed in P43-P44 (nearly 5,000 units aggregate) to recover from the Black Friday stockout. These large shipments are expected to arrive in P47 and P48. Given the high in-transit volume and the expected post-holiday demand drop-off in January, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P43-P46) to capture the current December trend (~621 units/week) while allowing the OR backend to restrict ordering due to the surplus pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand softening: Period 46 demand (475) is 30% lower than the early December baseline (~677), marking the end of the holiday peak.
