Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple 'Divided Collection' high-waisted skinny denim. Historical demand shows a significant jump from early January (avg ~28) to late January/early February (avg ~150). The most recent sample (2019-02-04) was 99. Given the promised lead time (L=4), we must cover demand for periods 1 through 5. Applying a conservative recent mean (N=3) of the last samples ([191, 160, 99]) results in an average of 150. Based on L=4, mu_hat should be approximately (1+4) * 150 = 750. Sigma is set using 'recent_N' to capture the recent high volatility (std dev of [191, 160, 99] is ~46.5, so sqrt(5)*46.5 approx 104).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a basic 'Divided Collection' item. Historical demand showed a significant jump from early January (20-36 units) to late January/early February (191, 160, 99 units). Period 1 (last week) saw a high demand of 184 units, but zero sales occurred because we had no starting inventory. The first order of 227 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 4. This means it should arrive at the start of Period 5. For now, we need to set parameters based on the recent demand regime (last 4 samples: 191, 160, 99, 184). Mean of these is ~158.5. Using L(promised)=4, mu_hat should target (1+4)*158.5 = 792.5. Sigma calculation over these 4 points is ~41.7, so sigma_hat = sqrt(5)*41.7 = ~93.2. This captures the current higher demand level compared to the very beginning of the year.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Looking at historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4: 20, 36, 191, 160, 99) and the first two periods of the game (184, 216), there is a significant demand regime shift starting in mid-January. The average demand across these last 4 periods (Jan 21 - Feb 18) is approximately 188 units/week. The product is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser, a staple fashion item. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals (Lead Time = 4) haven't started yet. The total in-transit is 455 units (orders from P1 and P2). Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean demand of ~188, the required base stock is around 940 units. I will set L to 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~188 * 5 = 940). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility in this higher regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-01-21; average weekly demand increased from <40 to ~188 units.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' from the Divided collection. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: early samples were low (<40), but from 2019-01-21 to present, demand has jumped significantly. The demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 was 184, 216, and 149 respectively (average ~183). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 702 units in-transit. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (227 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4) and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Therefore, current zero stock and zero arrivals are expected. I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand regime (last 6 samples: 191, 160, 99, 184, 216, 149; mean \u2248 166.5) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods. Using recent_N=6 captures this higher-demand shift while ignoring the very low initial noise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is Jade HW Skinny Denim (High-waisted jeans), which is a staple fashion item. Examining the history, a demand regime shift occurred around 2019-01-21, where demand increased from ~30 units to a new mean of approximately 172 units (avg of 191, 160, 99, 184, 216, 149, 159). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (227 units), Period 2 (228 units), Period 3 (247 units), and Period 4 (131 units) are all in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect the Period 1 order to arrive DURING Period 5 (reflected in Period 6's start). As of now, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet, lead time has not been surpassed. I will set L to 'default' (4). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the last 5 demand observations since the regime shift: 184, 216, 149, 159, and the preceding 99) to capture the current stable demand of ~160-180 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim (Trousers). Historical demand shows a significant increase starting late January 2019. The mean demand over the last 5 weeks (Periods 1-5) is 171.8 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of a shift to ~188 units. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). There is currently 76 units on-hand and 606 in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend logic uses a 50% service level (q=0.5), which maps to ordering up to the mean demand over (L+1) periods (base_stock \u2248 mu_hat when z=0). I will use the recent demand regime (last 5 weeks) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=5 forRecent_N provides a mu_hat calculation of (1+4)*171.8 = 859. This ensures we maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand over the lead time plus current period while accounting for the high volatility observed (std dev ~28.6 per week).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the product 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows a stable demand regime following the shift identified in Period 3. Since the shift (2019-01-21), demand has consistently hovered around a mean of ~170 units (Period 1-6 demand: 184, 216, 149, 159, 151, 159). The actual lead time has been confirmed as exactly 4 periods for the first two order arrivals (P1 and P2 orders arrived in P5 and P6 respectively), matching the promised lead time. Inventory is now flowing, with on-hand units finally available to meet demand. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 555 units. I will set L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now statistically confirmed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-regime-shift behavior (Periods 1-6) while excluding the early January low-demand samples, ensuring the base-stock calculation reflects current sell-through rates (~170/week).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 and P2 orders both arrived with 4-period lead time). Demand stabilized post-regime-shift at ~170 units/week.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is entering Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Jeans. Historical demand analysis shows a significant regime shift occurred in late January/early February. Looking at the recent stable period (Periods 1-7), the demand mean is 167.3 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. Current inventory status reflects on-hand: 239 units and in-transit: 457 units. Observations from Period 5, 6, and 7 confirm that the actual lead time L = 4 periods consistently. The backend OR logic uses L+1 to cover the risk during the lead time and the review period. I am setting L to explicit 4 to confirm the observed pattern. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=7 (covering the stable demand period since Feb 11) to capture the current mean of ~167. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the relatively low volatility (std ~23) observed during this period. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+4)*167.3 + z*(sqrt(1+4)*22.8) \u2248 836 + z*51. Given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, q=0.5 and z=0, resulting in a base stock aim of approximately 836. Pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 696, suggesting an order of ~140 units is appropriate.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016006' (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a stable demand regime. Since moving out of the initial low-demand phase in late January, the weekly demand over the last 8 periods (P1-P8) has averaged approximately 172 units (min 149, max 216). In Period 8, we observed a slight increase to 205 units, but this remains within the expected volatility range. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods, as established by four consecutive orders (P1 through P4) arriving exactly at L=4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 165 units and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 467 units (orders from P6, P7, P8, and the upcoming P9 order). Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand over the risk horizon (L+1 = 5 periods). I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime's mean (approx. 860 for 5 periods) and variance while ignoring the irrelevant pre-February data.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-15. The product is a core denim item (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) in the Divided collection. Since the regime shift identified in Period 3 (2019-01-21), weekly demand has remained stable. For the last 5 periods (P5-P9), demand has been 151, 159, 153, 205, and 165, averaging 166.6 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. In Period 9, all 165 units of on-hand inventory were sold, leaving 0 on-hand. In-transit inventory is 683 units, consisting of orders from P6 (177), P7 (149), P8 (141), and P9 (216). The order from P5 was 0 units, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported in the Period 9 conclude message. We expect the P6 order (177 units) to arrive during Period 10. To maintain a base stock covering (L+1)=5 weeks of demand, I will use recent_N with N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the stable post-shift average, and default settings for lead time and sigma_hat.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/4/22), we analyze SKU 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P6 order arrived in P10). Demand has been more volatile recently, dropping to 121 in P10 from a high of 205 in P8, but overall sits within the 'high demand' regime identified in Period 3. Recent history (P5-P10) shows mean demand around 160 units. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this regime accurately. Note: P5 order (placed in P5, expected arrival P9) appears missing/delayed, creating an inventory gap that resulted in a stockout in P9. The OR backend needs to account for this pipeline gap. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6, we provide the model with the current post-shift demand characteristics. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, though the OR 'cap' mechanism adds a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: P5 order (placed 2019-03-11) is potentially lost or significantly delayed; it was expected in P9 but has not arrived as of P10 conclude.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-29. Historical demand for the last five periods (P7-P11) averaged 132.4 units, showing a slight decline from the previous 170-unit average, though the product (skinny denim) remains a stable wardrobe staple. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P7 orders. Notably, the order from Period 5 (placed 2019-03-11) is now severely overdue; it was expected in P9 but has not arrived as of the end of P11. I am treating this specific shipment as lost for the purpose of planning to avoid stockouts. Parameters are set to cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. I will use a recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the slight downward trend, L=4 (promised/observed), and explicit sigma to handle the risk of the missing shipment and potential demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: P5 order (placed 2019-03-11) confirmed lost/missing: 3 periods overdue as of P12 start. Demand regime slightly lowered to ~132 units/week over the last 5 periods (P7-P11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the product is in a stabilized demand regime. Over the last 5 periods (P8-P12), average demand has been approximately 152 units/week (205, 165, 121, 119, 150). The order from Period 5 remains lost, effectively reducing our pipeline inventory for the OR backend's calculation. The lead time for successful deliveries (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8) has been consistent at 4 periods. Since the current demand is relatively stable, I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the current mean and volatility. This helps the backend calculate a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the review period (1).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple fashion item. Historical demand since Period 6 (stable regime) averages 145 units/week (last 8 periods). The last 3 periods (P11-P13) show slightly lower demand (avg 135.7), while the last 5 periods (P9-P13) show an average of 138.6. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P9 order in P13. The P5 order is still confirmed lost, as it did not arrive by P13. Pipeline inventory sits at 467 units (P10, P11, P12, P13 orders). With an on-hand inventory of 155, the total stock position is 622. Based on a 5-period horizon (L+1) and a demand of ~140, we need approx 700. I will set mu_hat using the recent 8-period average (post-regime shift) which is ~145 * 5 = 725 units to ensure adequate coverage and recover from the lost P5 shipment, while adjusting sigma to handle volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS. Demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has stabilized around an average of 132.8 units (121, 119, 150, 138, 136), which is lower than the initial post-shift average of ~170. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods for all successfully delivered shipments. Shipment P5 (ordered P5, expected P9) is officially written off as lost, as we are now in P15 and have successfully received orders from P6, P7, P8, P9, and P10. The current pipeline inventory includes orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14 (totaling 452 units). With on-hand inventory at 169 units and an average lead time of 4, we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Setting L to default (4) and mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the 132.8 average) will target a base stock of approximately 664 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 621 units, so the backend will order approximately 43 units to bridge the gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~133 units/week since Period 10 (P10-P14 avg: 132.8). Shipment from Period 5 confirmed lost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016006' (Skinny Denim Trousers) has shown a stable demand regime over the last 6 periods (P10-P15), with a mean demand of approximately 137 units per week (121, 119, 150, 138, 136, 160). As of Period 16 START, we see 'Period 15 conclude' shows on-hand inventory at 92. The in-transit inventory is 412 units, consisting of orders from P12 (87), P13 (147), P14 (135), and P15 (43). The P5 order is definitively lost, and the lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods for all successfully delivered shipments. I will set the lead time method to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 4-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture the current stable regime (avg ~137.3) while filtering out the higher demand historical spikes and the Period 9 stockout distortion.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 is a 'Skinny Denim TRS', which typically sees steady demand but can be sensitive to stock levels. Current Period 17 (June 3, 2019). Reviewing recent demand (P12-P16): 150, 138, 136, 160, 115. The average of these last 5 periods is 139.8 units/week. Since the period 10-14 average was 132.8, the regime remains stable around 135-140 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The P5 order is lost, and the 'In-transit' of 489 units represents orders from P13 (147), P14 (135), P15 (43), and P16 (164). P13 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of the current Period 17 (visible in P17 conclude). Because of the 1:1 profit to holding cost ratio, the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand (z=0). I will use a 5-period window for mu_hat to capture the most recent stability and a slightly wider 10-period window for sigma_hat to ensure adequate safety stock against the volatility observed in demand spikes (range 115-160).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Demand for this denim item has seen a slight softening over the last three periods (160, 115, 86) compared to the stable regime of ~133 observed through Period 15. The recent 5-period average (P13-P17) is 127 units. On-hand inventory is 125, and there's a pipeline of 488 units. This pipeline includes orders from P14 (135 units, expected to arrive this period), P15 (43 units), P16 (164 units), and P17 (146 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P13 order in P17. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable-to-slightly-softening demand trend (approx 130 per week). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=8) to capture the recent volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation (Target = (L+1) * mu) accounts for the next 5 weeks of demand while reflecting current consumption levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Average demand for P13-P17 dropped to 127 units/week compared to the previous 133 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/6/17), the current demand regime shows a continued softening trend. The last 5 periods (P14-P18) recorded demand of [136, 160, 115, 86, 121], averaging 123.6 units/week. This is a decline from the previous regime of ~133 units/week. The P5 shipment remains lost and is excluded from pipeline calculations. In-transit arrivals for P14 and P13 have concluded with a stable 4-period lead time. Pipeline inventory status: On-hand is 139; In-transit (excluding P5) is 381. To adjust for the current downward trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5. sigma_hat is set using N=10 to capture moderate volatility while respecting the lower demand mean. L remains at the promised/observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed: Avg weekly demand for P14-P18 is ~124 units, down from the previous stabilization level of ~133.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' (jeans), which typically sees a seasonal softening in early summer as consumers shift toward lighter clothing. Historical demand confirms this: the average weekly demand from P14-P18 was ~124 units, and P19 demand just dropped significantly to 78 units. The period 5 shipment (ordered P1) is confirmed lost, while recent shipments (P9-P15) have all arrived with a consistent 4-period lead time. Pipeline inventory (436 units) consists of orders from P16-P19. To adjust for the continuing downward trend in demand, I am reducing N to 5 for mu_hat (average of P15-P19 is approx 112 units) to faster capture the recent drop. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline: Average weekly demand for P15-P19 is ~112 units, significantly lower than the P10-P14 average of ~133 units, suggesting a summer seasonal slowdown.

The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has shown a consistent softening trend over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), with weekly demand dropping to an average of ~102 units (115, 86, 121, 78, 110), compared to the ~133 average observed previously. This decline is consistent with a summer slowdown for heavier denim products. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P16 order arrived in P20). Pipeline inventory is currently 292, which with on-hand (158) totals 450 units. Given the lower demand regime and equal profit/holding costs (recommending a 50% service level), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent decline and reflect an average weekly demand of ~102 units. Pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 4 weeks of the current demand pace, but new orders are needed to maintain the target base stock across the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline confirmed: average weekly demand for P16-P20 fell further to ~102 units, supporting the summer seasonal slowdown hypothesis for denim.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016006' (Jade HW Skinny Denim) continues to exhibit a downward seasonal demand trend as we move further into July. The average weekly demand for the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21: 86, 121, 78, 110, 146) is approximately 108 units, which is a significant drop from the spring stabilization level of ~133. This aligns with the summer seasonal slowdown hypothesized previously. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P17 order arrived in P21). I will set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the stable lead-time performance and mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower demand regime (~108 units/week * 5 periods = 540). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility observed in the last few weeks (ranging from 78 to 146). The current inventory (On-hand: 158 + In-transit: 206 = 364 total) is slightly low relative to a base stock for 5 periods of demand at the new mean, so this will trigger a moderate replenishment order to maintain service levels while respecting the lower seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal slowdown confirmed through July 1st: Avg demand for P17-P21 is ~108 units, down ~18% from the spring avg of ~133 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a sustained summer seasonal slowdown. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is approximately 113.2 units, which is significantly lower than the spring average of ~133 units. The most recent demand (P22) was 111 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P18 order arriving in P22). With an on-hand inventory of 75 units and 332 units in-transit (covering orders from P19, P20, P21, and P22), we need to maintain a lower base stock to avoid excess holding costs, given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime while ensuring we have enough stock to cover the 5-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal slowdown confirmed through mid-July: Avg demand for P18-P22 is ~113 units, down ~15% from the spring stabilization level of ~133 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 24 (July 22, 2019). The demand regime remains in a summer seasonal slowdown, with demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) averaging 110.2 units/week, consistent with the previous carry-over insight of ~113. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P19 order in P23. On-hand is 67, with 388 units in-transit (P20-P23 orders). Since profit = holding cost ($1.00 each), the target cycle service level q = 0.5, meaning base_stock should target the median demand over (L+1) periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current summer demand levels and avoid over-ordering based on higher spring averages. The OR backend will calculate the capped order based on these parameters.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (denim trousers) is currently experiencing a sustained summer seasonal slowdown. The average weekly demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 106 units, compared to the spring average of ~133 units. This confirms multiple previous insights regarding a demand regime decline. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as evidenced by the arrival of the P20 order in P24. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 29 units and a substantial pipeline inventory of 464 units (orders from P21, P22, P23, and P24). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level. My parameters aim to align the stock position (on-hand + pipeline) with the expected demand over the lead time plus one review period (5 periods total). I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the summer regime) to reflect the current mean of ~106 units per week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-08-05. The SKU is high-waisted skinny denim. We have confirmed a summer seasonal slowdown starting around June/July. Average weekly demand for the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) is approx 97 units (146, 111, 106, 58, 63), which is significantly lower than the spring stabilization of ~133 units. Demand in late July (P24-P25) has dropped further to ~60 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of P21's order in P25). On-hand inventory is low (26 units), but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (442 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which implies a 50% service level target (q = 0.5), and the recent slowing demand, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering as we move through August. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal slowdown intensified in late July: avg weekly demand for P21-P25 dropped to ~97 units, with the last two weeks (P24-P25) averaging ~60 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-August (2019-08-12). Demand for this denim SKU has shown a clear summer seasonal slowdown since late June, with the most recent sample (P26) showing a slight rebound to 105 units from the previous two weeks of ~60 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 88.6 units. Given the low profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level, essentially aiming for the mean demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 75 units, and in-transit is 304 units (covering P23-P26 orders). I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand levels (recent_N=5) to avoid over-ordering during this slow period, while sigma_hat will also use recent volatility to manage the holding cost risks.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal slowdown bottomed in late July (P24-P25 ~60 units); P26 shows a potential early August uptick to 105 units, but the 5-week average remains low at ~89 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand for this high-waisted denim SKU showed a significant summer seasonal slowdown throughout July, with weekly demand bottoming around 60 units in late July. However, Period 26 and 27 show a sharp rebound (105 and 153 units respectively), aligning with typical 'Back-to-School' shopping trends for denim in mid-to-late August. I am moving the demand regime forecast to reflect this recovery. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the transition from the seasonal low to the current uptick. L remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (P22 and P23 both arrived exactly in 4 periods). Pipeline inventory (214) plus current on-hand (76) is 290 units, which covers approximately 2.5 weeks of current demand; higher parameters are needed to ensure the OR engine maintains stock for the late August/September peak.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery confirmed: August demand (P26-P27) averaged 129 units, up from the July seasonal low of ~90 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29 (late August). Historical demand analysis confirms a seasonal trough in July (avg ~75 units) followed by a strong 'Back-to-School' recovery in August. Demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) was 105, 153, and 139 units respectively, averaging 132.3 units. This aligns with the spring stabilization level (~133 units) before the summer dip. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P24 order arriving in P28). With on-hand inventory at 33 and in-transit at 279, the pipeline is relatively strong, but we must maintain support for the higher demand regime. Using N=3 for mu_hat to capture the immediate August recovery momentum, while using a slightly longer N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the transition from the July volatility.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery (Aug 2019) has returned weekly demand to spring levels (~133 units/week), following the July seasonal low (~75 units/week).

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a strong demand recovery for this SKU (Skinny Denim) following the July seasonal low. Weekly demand in Period 29 reached 162 units, significantly higher than the previous 5-week average (~112) and the late-July lows (~60). This aligns with 'Back-to-School' and early autumn trends for denim. In Period 29, the system stocked out, selling only 71 units due to low on-hand inventory, leaving 91 units of unmet demand. The pipeline inventory (445 units) includes the large orders placed in Periods 28 (161) and 29 (204) to address this recovery. To set parameters for Period 30, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 (Periods 26-29) to capture the upturn while smoothing the volatility of the stock-out period. The mean demand for the last 4 periods is (105+153+139+162)/4 = 139.75 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using these recent high-demand samples ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current demand regime (~700 units total pipeline), balancing the high profit/holding cost ratio (1:1) effectively.

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery sustained: Avg demand for P26-P29 is ~140 units, confirming a return to (and potential exceedance of) spring demand levels after the summer slump.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 is currently experiencing a significant demand spike following the back-to-school recovery. Demand in Period 30 reached 282 units, the highest since the simulation began, even though on-hand inventory was insufficient to fulfill it (only 16 units sold). The 4-week average demand (P27-P30) is approximately 184 units, sharply up from the summer low (~90 units). We are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory (610 units) is robust, but the immediate challenge is bridging the lead-time gap. Given the sharp upward trend as we enter September, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new regime (approx. 184 units/week baseline). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility during this growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: P30 demand peaked at 282 units, significantly above the spring baseline of ~133. The 4-week average (P27-P30) has shifted to ~184 units/week.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (Skinny Denim) has entered a significant autumn/back-to-school demand surge. For the last two periods (P30-P31), demand has spiked to 282 and 289 units respectively, compared to the spring baseline of ~133 and the July low of ~75. The current 4-week average (P28-P31) is approximately 218 units, but the most recent two weeks average 285 units. Given this rapid acceleration coinciding with September, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this surge while maintaining some stability against potential outliers. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility during this growth phase. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (P26 and P27 orders arrived on time). Despite a high in-transit quantity of 839 units, on-hand inventory is currently 0, necessitating parameters that signal the OR backend to maintain a high base stock to satisfy the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed and accelerating: Demand for P30-P31 averaged 285 units, a ~115% increase over the spring baseline (~133 units). Early autumn seasonal peak for denim is evident.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn seasonal peak for denim (late September). Recent demand has surged significantly, with the last three periods (P30-P32) recording demand values of 282, 289, and 266 units, far exceeding the spring baseline of ~133. The average demand for the last 3 periods is ~279 units/week. Since the backend computes base_stock = (1+L) * mu_hat, and L=4 (promised and verified), we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this current peak. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility during this surge. We have experienced stockouts (on-hand zero) for 4 consecutive periods due to this unexpected demand spike, despite significant in-transit inventory (929 units). This aggressive parametrization ensures the OR backend attempts to catch up to the current demand regime and maintain service levels during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak confirmed: Weekly demand for P30-P32 averaged ~279 units, a ~110% increase over the spring baseline and significantly higher than the August recovery levels.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 34 (2019/09/30). History shows a massive demand surge in late September, with Period 33 demand reaching 455 units. The last four periods (P30-P33) averaged 323 units/week, far exceeding the previous autumn baseline of ~279. This indicates a sharp seasonal peak for denim products. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced significant lost sales due to stockouts in the last five periods (P29-P33). In-transit inventory is 1024, but with demand potentially sustaining at >300 units/week and a 4-period lead time, we must maintain high parameters to capture this peak. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4-week average (approx 323 * 5 = 1615) to ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the high volatility during this surge. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late September demand explosion: Average weekly demand for P30-P33 shifted to ~323 units, significantly higher than the early Sept baseline of ~279, indicating a localized peak in denim demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand autumn peak for denim. Recent weekly demand has been extremely volatile but high: P30 (282), P31 (289), P32 (266), P33 (455), and P34 (246). The average over these 5 periods is approximately 308 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have suffered stockouts in the last 6 consecutive periods (P29-P34). The pipeline inventory is high (1312 units), with expected arrivals of 293 (P35), 251 (P36), 299 (P37), and 469 (P38). To account for the current 'explosion' in demand and the risk of stockouts during this seasonal peak, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1540 (representing a forecast of ~308 units/week over L+1 = 5 periods). sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in September. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak demand (Sept-Oct) established at ~308 units/week, up from ~133 spring baseline; high volatility observed (std dev increasing).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in the midst of its autumn seasonal peak (September/October), which has seen demand surge to an average of approximately 308 units per week, significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~133 units. The most recent demand samples are 282, 289, 266, 455, 246, and 246 units. While the last two periods show a slight cooling from the extreme peak of 455, the overall level remains high and volatile. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (47 units), but there is a substantial pipeline (1247 units) scheduled to arrive. Using the recent 6 periods (N=6) captures this autumn regime's mean (~297 units) and provides a sufficient buffer for the high variance observed during this peak. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent high-demand regime ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level capable of meeting the sustained autumn demand without over-ordering as we approach the potential end of the season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is exiting its peak autumn demand phase. Following the late September/early October explosion where demand reached 455 units (P33), the last three periods have shown a clear decelerating trend: 246 units (P34-P35) and 158 units (P36). This aligns with seasonal transitions in apparel. The mean demand for the last 4 weeks (P33-P36) is approximately 276 units, but this is heavily skewed by the P33 outlier. The most recent 2 weeks average 202 units. Given the downward trajectory, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to account for the current volume while acknowledging the cooling market. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to capture the high volatility seen during this peak-to-trough transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrivals in P35 and P36. The current on-hand (140) and high in-transit (1189) are sufficient to cover the cooling demand, so the OR backend will likely moderate order sizing.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand for denim is decelerating: after a late Sept peak of ~455 units, demand cooled to an average of ~217 units in the first half of October (P34-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is transitioning out of its autumn peak. Demand in the most recent three periods (P35-P37) has settled at an average of 195 units/week (246, 158, 182), significantly lower than the late September spikes that reached 455 units. The 5-week average (P33-P37) is approximately 257 units, but the downward trend suggests using a shorter window for the forecast to avoid overstocking as winter approaches. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Inventory is currently healthy with 257 on-hand and 943 in-transit, totaling 1200 units. A 5-period window (L+1) at the recent average of ~195 units/week requires 975 units; our pipeline (1200) is currently sufficient. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the cooling demand while maintaining enough safety stock (sigma_hat default) to handle residual volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn denim peak demand has subsided; demand regime shifted from ~300+ units/week in Sept to ~195 units/week in Oct (P35-P37 average).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (start of November), the autumn peak for denim has clearly subsided. Demand over the last 4 periods (P35-P38) has averaged 191 units/week (246, 158, 182, 178), appearing to stabilize much lower than the September peaks (~300+ units) but higher than the spring baseline (~133 units). Inventory is currently high with an on-hand balance of 548 units and 561 units in-transit (total pipeline of 1109 units), largely due to the arrival of massive orders placed during the September demand explosion (e.g., P34's 469-unit order which arrived in P38). With a lead time confirmed at 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current 4-week average of ~191 units/week, required inventory is ~955 units. Given our total inventory of 1109 units, we are currently overstocked relative to current demand trends. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this post-peak stabilization and use 'calculate' for L as the 4-period lead time remains consistent. This will likely result in the OR backend placing a minimal or zero order to allow existing stock to bleed down.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak stabilization: weekly demand for Period 35-38 has averaged ~191 units, down ~40% from the September peak (~323 units) but remaining above the spring baseline (~133 units).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn peak for denim (September/October) has clearly subsided, with demand settling into a new, lower regime. Recent demand over the last four periods (P36-P39) has been 158, 182, 178, and 156, averaging ~168 units/week. This is a significant decrease from the early October average of ~300+ units but remains higher than the spring baseline of ~133. We are currently holding 620 units on-hand with 333 units in-transit (Total = 953 units). Given the lead time (L=4) plus current period (Total 5 periods), and a stabilized demand around 168 units/week, we already have sufficient stock to cover roughly 5.6 weeks of demand (953 / 168 \u2248 5.67). Over-ordering now would result in unnecessary holding costs as we likely transition towards late-autumn/winter patterns. I will set mu_hat to reflect this stabilized demand of ~168 units/week (Total mu_hat = 5 * 168 = 840) and keep sigma_hat moderate to reflect the recent decrease in volatility compared to the September peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak demand regime stabilized: avg weekly demand for P36-P39 is ~168 units, down from the September peak (~323 units) but ~25% above the spring baseline (~133 units).

The demand regime has clearly transitioned from the September autumn peak (~323 units/week) to a post-peak stabilization level averaging 168.5 units over the last four periods (P37-P40: 182, 178, 156, 170). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high inventory, the OR backend needs to stop ordering to allow stock to deplete. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining the L=4 setting. No new orders are expected to be generated by the OR backend as the current pipeline significantly exceeds the target base stock (calculated as roughly 5 * 168.5 = 842.5 before variance, but with high on-hand, it is prudent to let it settle).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has stabilized after the autumn peak, with a 4-week average (P38-P41) of approximately 169 units/week. This represents a significant drop from the September peak (~323 units) but remains above the spring baseline (~133 units). Inventory levels are currently high (on-hand: 525) due to conservative ordering during the high-volatility peak, resulting in high holding costs. The pipeline consists of orders from P38 (87 units) and P41 (75 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given that we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47) and currently hold over 3 weeks of stock at the current demand rate, I will set parameters to allow the current inventory to be consumed while maintaining a safety buffer. Mu_hat is set using a recent 4-period window to capture this post-peak stabilization regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked significantly to 506 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (Nov 29, 2019 falls between P42 and P43). This follows a stable period where demand averaged ~168 units. Given the seasonality of denim and the date (Dec 2), we anticipate this was a localized promotional spike rather than a permanent regime shift, but variance (sigma) must be adjusted to account for such volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 106, with 232 units in-transit. To avoid over-ordering based on the high P42 outlier while ensuring enough stock for the remainder of the holiday season, I will use a recent_N (N=7) approach for mu_hat to capture the post-autumn stabilization including the spike (avg ~218), and an explicit sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in the last 2 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 (Nov 25) saw demand jump to 506 units (Black Friday), up from the previous ~168 unit baseline.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/09), we are navigating the post-Black Friday (P42) period. Demand in Period 43 (Dec 2) was 110 units, a sharp drop from the peak of 506. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 634 units in-transit. The OR backend needs to balance providing enough stock for a potential pre-Christmas surge against the high holding cost ($1.0/unit). While standard denim demand often stabilizes or dips slightly mid-December before a January clearance rush, high-waisted skinny jeans (Divided collection) are consistent sellers. Given the recent volatile demand (regime shift at P42), I will use a conservative window to estimate the new baseline. The previous spring/autumn baselines were ~133 and ~170, respectively. I'll set mu_hat to an explicit value of 850 (covering 5 periods at an average of 170 units/week) to account for holiday shopping consistency while mitigating the risk of over-ordering based on the single Black Friday outlier. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43) dropped to 110 units, indicating the extreme spike was isolated to the holiday weekend; reverting to a baseline slightly above spring levels (~170 units) for December planning.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand inventory is 0 after a high Nov 25 (Black Friday) demand emptied stock, followed by a demand of 113 in P44. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The order from P39 (placed 2019/11/04) was 0 units, which explains why no shipment arrived in P43 conclude message. The order from P40 was also 0 units, explaining the lack of arrival in P44 conclude. We are now waiting for orders from P41 (75 units), P42 (157 units), P43 (402 units), and P44 (216 units). The demand has settled post-Black Friday; P43 and P44 shows a return to levels around ~110-115 per week, slightly lower than the spring baseline. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the post-autumn stabilization while absorbing the outlier spike from Black Friday, and keep sigma_hat on default to ensure sufficient buffer against recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P44) has returned to ~112 units/week, similar to the pre-peak spring levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. Demand for the last three periods (P43-P45) has averaged 106 units/week (110, 113, 95), confirming that the Black Friday surge was isolated and demand has returned to a level slightly lower than the spring baseline (~133), likely due to the post-holiday lull or end-of-year seasonal shifts for denim. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 995 units, which includes 157 (P42), 402 (P43), 216 (P44), and 220 (P45). The P42 order (expected this period, P46) is included in the 'In-transit' figure. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Because the current demand regime has shifted down from the Autumn and Black Friday peaks, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the stabilization between 100-170 units without being overly influenced by the 506-unit outlier. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if the 995 units in-transit are sufficient to cover the projected demand for the L+1 window.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Avg weekly demand for P43-P45 settled at ~106 units, approximately 20% lower than the spring baseline (~133 units).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has moved past the holiday peaks (Black Friday and mid-Autumn). Historical data and recent observations (P43-P46) show demand has stabilized at a lower level (~100 units/week) compared to the Autumn peak (~300 units/week). Specifically, the average demand for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) is 98.25 units. This matches the 'post-holiday stabilization' insight. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new lower baseline while maintaining a safety buffer. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P45 and P46). The high in-transit amount (838 units) is largely due to large orders placed in P43-P45 to restock after the Black Friday stockout; these units are expected to arrive in P47-P49. Given the low on-hand (82) and high in-transit relative to demand, the OR engine will likely moderate ordering further to avoid excess inventory costs.
