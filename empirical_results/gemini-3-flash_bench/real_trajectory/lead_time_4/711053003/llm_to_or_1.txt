Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 711053003 (Long T-shirt). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks shows an increasing trend (13, 21, 55, 47, 23). The mean of the historical demand is 31.8, and the standard deviation is 18.0. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Since we have no inventory on-hand or in-transit, we need to establish a base stock levels. I will use the 'default' method for L (which is 4), mu_hat, and sigma_hat to allow the OR engine to leverage all available historical samples (N=5) for its initial calculation. No lead time data is available yet to justify a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Long T-shirt', which is a wardrobe staple. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show values of 13, 21, 55, 47, and 23. Period 1 demand was significantly higher at 79, which may indicate a build-up in interest or a seasonal shift as we move further into February. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have very little inventory history (on-hand 0, in-transit 62 from Period 1), we must set parameters that allow the backend to cover the (L+1) horizon. Calculating the mean demand from all samples (13, 21, 55, 47, 23, 79) gives 39.7 units/period. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this recent spike while acknowledging the earlier lower demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect the high volatility (13 to 79). I'll keep L at the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend (13, 21, 55, 47, 23 in pre-game samples; followed by 79 and 115 in Periods 1 and 2). This suggests a strong seasonal ramp-up as spring approaches. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 144 units in-transit (62 from P1, 82 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order from P1 is expected to arrive in P5 (visible in P6). Because the actual demand (79, 115) has significantly outpaced the initial pre-game average (~32), I am switching to recent_N (N=4, including the two game periods and the last two pre-game samples) to capture this higher demand regime for forecasting. This will ensure mu_hat reflects the current velocity. I will maintain the default lead time (L=4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a drift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from pre-game avg of 32 to game avg of 97 in Periods 1-2, likely due to spring seasonality for T-shirts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a Long T-shirt, and demand has surged significantly compared to the pre-game baseline (avg 31.8). The demand for P1-P3 is (79, 115, 96), averaging 96.7. This confirms the earlier insight of a regime shift. Regarding lead time: the promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the mechanics: an order placed in P1 arrives during P5's arrival phase and is visible in P5's 'conclude' message (available for the P6 decision). Thus, the fact that arrived=0 in P1-P3 is expected behavior. However, on-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales. I need to maintain high coverage. I will use the recent 3 periods (P1-P3) to forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime. L remains at the promised value of 4 as no delivery data is available yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is a 'Long T-shirt in soft jersey', a seasonal garment for spring. Demand history shows a clear regime shift from a pre-game average of 32.2 to a game average (P1-P4) of 101.75 (79, 115, 96, 117). This indicates a sustained high-demand period. Although promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals have occurred yet from the P1 order (ordered P1, 4 periods ago). According to the execution order, the P1 order should arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at P6). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) with 403 units in transit. Since we haven't confirmed any arrivals or actual lead times yet, I will use 'calculate' for L. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (+215% vs pre-game) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for this jump while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio q=0.8).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P1-P4 avg: 101.75 vs pre-game: 32.2). Arrival of P1 order expected to be confirmed in P6 START to validate L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a Long T-shirt, which is entering peak spring season. Historical analysis shows a clear demand regime shift: the pre-game average was ~32, while the average demand since Period 1 is 97.6 (79, 115, 96, 117, 81), representing a ~200% increase. The arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5 confirms the promised lead time (L=4) is accurate. Currently, On-hand is 0 because demand (81) exceeded the arrival (62). We have 411 units in-transit (82 from P2, 132 from P3, 127 from P4, 132 from P5). Given the item is a seasonal basic and demand is consistently high, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for the current mean of ~98/week plus safety stock for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Sustained high-demand regime (avg ~98) confirmed through P5, representing a 3x increase over pre-game baseline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/3/25). Demand for this T-shirt SKU remains high as we move into spring, with a current game average of 96.6 units/period (P1-P6), which is significantly higher than the pre-game baseline of ~32. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). We have a stockout situation: on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (92) exceeded the arrival (82) in Period 6. Currently, 440 units are in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Using the recent demand regime (last 6 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the base stock reflects the current spring demand levels rather than being diluted by the lower pre-game historical samples. This aggressive stance is justified by a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) which favors higher service levels to avoid further lost sales.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Tess Tee' T-shirt has stabilized in a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 98.7 units per period over the 7 periods of play (P1-P7: 79, 115, 96, 117, 81, 92, 95). This is significantly higher than the pre-game baseline of ~33. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on clear arrivals from P1, P2, and P3 in periods P5, P6, and P7 respectively. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the demand-over-lead-time window (L+1) is 5 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained high regime while ignoring the outdated pre-game samples. This translates to an expected demand of ~493.5 units over the (L+1) horizon. Current inventory (on-hand 37 + in-transit 383 = 420) is slightly below this target, so the OR backend should generate an order to cover the gap.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a T-shirt, which is entering its peak spring/summer season. In Period 8, we saw a massive demand spike to 190 units (nearly double the previous 8-period average of ~108), likely driven by warming weather and the approach of Easter/Spring holidays. This surge resulted in a stockout (sold 164 of 190 demand). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Given the recent trend and the sharp spike in P8, using a recent window (N=5) to calculate \u03bc\u0302 is too conservative as it averages the 190 with lower previous values. I will set \u03bc\u0302 explicitly to capture a continued high-demand regime (~120-140 per week). Total demand for 5 periods = 5 * 135 = 675. Sigma will also be set explicitly to account for the high volatility seen in P8 (std dev of recent periods is high). Lead time L is set to calculated as it has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: demand spiked to 190 (+75% over previous average), signaling peak seasonal demand for T-shirts.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. We are managing a T-shirt SKU, which is now entering its peak spring/summer season. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on systematic arrivals from Period 1 to 5. There was a significant demand spike in Period 8 (190 units), followed by a return to a high-but-stable level in Period 9 (101 units). The average demand over the last 9 in-game periods is approximately 109.5 units. Given the transition into late April, I anticipate demand will remain high or continue to increase. I am setting L=4 (promised) as it is consistently validated. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=9 to capture the higher in-game demand regime (averaging ~109.5) while smoothing the Period 8 outlier. This translates to an expected demand over the review cycle + lead time (5 periods) of ~547 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=9) to account for the increased volatility observed in the recent seasonal spike.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (April 22). The lead time is confirmed as L=4 (orders from P1-P6 have arrived consistently at L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand patterns show two regimes: P1-P7 averaged ~96, and P8-P10 showed a spike (190, 101, 81) averaging ~124, likely driven by spring/Easter seasonality for T-shirts. Period 8's extreme demand (190) suggests a peak, but we remain in a higher-demand phase compared to pre-game. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this elevated demand average (~124 per period) and ensure the (L+1) window (620 units) is covered by pipeline inventory (currently 520 units). The sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the high volatility seen in P8-P10.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 12 (late April). The product is a short-sleeved T-shirt. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods across five consecutive arrivals (P1-P7 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). Demand analysis shows a baseline of ~98 (P1-P7), but a significant spike occurred in P8 (190), followed by an average of 85.3 in P9-P11. The spike in P8 (April 1st) likely corresponded to a specific spring launch or early Easter promotion. Given we are approaching May, demand should remain steady in the high-demand regime or potentially increase. Currently, on-hand is only 1 unit and 655 units are in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). The P8 order of 91 units is expected to arrive this period (P12). To set parameters: 1) L=4 (standard and consistent). 2) mu_hat: Using recent_N=4 to capture the high-demand volatility (mean of P8-P11 is 111.5). Since mu_hat = (1+L)*mean, (1+4)*111.5 = 557.5. 3) sigma_hat: Using recent_N=4 to reflect the high variance observed in April (P8-P11). The OR backend will use these to determine if the 655 in-transit units + 1 on-hand + new order adequately cover the 5-period horizon.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711053003' (Long T-shirt) is in a high-demand spring/summer phase. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of the concluding message for Period 12 shows that the order from Period 8 (91 units) arrived, confirming the actual lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 8, demand has fluctuated but remains significantly higher than pre-game levels: P8 (190), P9 (101), P10 (81), P11 (74), P12 (104). The spike in P8 (190) appears to be an outlier or peak event, while the sub-sequent periods (P9-P12) have averaged ~90 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (P9-P12) provides a representative mean for the current demand regime (~90 per period). L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistently confirmed. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to capture the current volatility while excluding the atypical P8 spike.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Phase 14 (May 13). Analyzing the demand history, we saw a significant spike in early April (Period 8: 190 units) which has since moderated. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 86.4 units. Comparing this to the high-demand 'spring' average established earlier (approx 100), it appears demand for this T-shirt SKU has stabilized after the peak. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P9 order arrived in P13). Current on-hand inventory is 133, with 362 units in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12). The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock using a target service level of 0.8 (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)). Given the return to a stable demand level around 85-90 units, I will use a recent_N window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilization while excluding the extreme P8 outlier. L stays at the promised/verified 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak (P9-P13) has stabilized at an average of 86.4 units, down from the 100+ average seen in early spring and the 190 spike in P8.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for this T-shirt SKU has stabilized following a large spike in early April (Period 8, 190 units). Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), demand has averaged 85.5 units (101, 81, 74, 104, 72, 81), which is a clear step down from the early spring peak but still significantly higher than the pre-game baseline. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1 through 10. We currently have 201 units on-hand and 213 in-transit (orders from P11 and P12). Given the lead time L=4, my parameters must cover a 5-period window (L+1). With an average demand of ~85.5, our total inventory position (414) is sufficient to cover approximately 4.8 periods of demand. To maintain this service level while avoiding excessive holding costs (which are significant at $1/unit/period), I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=6 to capture this post-peak stabilization. sigma_hat will also use N=6 to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the earlier spike.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27th (Period 16). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in arrival messages for P1 through P11). Inventory is currently high (315 on-hand) due to large orders placed earlier (P9-P11) arriving in Period 13-15. Demand has stabilized following the early April peak (P8: 190); the average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 85.4 units, which is consistent with the post-peak stabilized average noted in Period 14 (86.4). Since the product is a Jersey T-shirt and we are approaching summer, demand is expected to remain steady or slightly increase. I will use the recent 5-period window (P11-P15) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the post-spike stabilized regime. This will help the OR backend adjust ordering to prevent excessive inventory accumulation while maintaining service levels for the (L+1) = 5 period outlook.

Daily Reward (R_t): $897.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a significant demand spike to 243 units. This occurs on 2019/5/27, coinciding with the approach of summer and likely a major promotional or seasonal event for T-shirts. Previously, demand had stabilized around 86 units (P9-P13), but a similar spike occurred in Period 8 (190 units). This new spike is the largest yet. Given the seasonality of a 'Jersey Basic Long T-shirt', the transition into June (Period 17) suggests either a sustained higher peak or high volatility. On-hand inventory is 75, and pipeline inventory is 136 (orders from P13-P16). Predicted lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent history. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast. The average of the last 4 periods (P13-P16) is 123; however, the recent 243 is a strong signal. I will set mu_hat based on an expected average demand of 120 units per period over the 5-period window (L+1), totaling 600. For sigma_hat, the recent high volatility requires a larger buffer to avoid stockouts during this period of high seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: New seasonal peak/volatility shift detected at Period 16 (demand 243, +180% vs previous 4-period avg). Demand is entering a high-summer phase for T-shirts.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer phase for T-shirts (June). In Period 16, demand spiked to 243, and in Period 17, it remained high at 178. This indicates a significant regime shift compared to the previous stabilization at ~86 units. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) due to this surge. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as seen in the history through Period 16, though Period 17 had no arrivals as expected from the low order in P13). To capture this new summer peak and prevent further stockouts over the (L+1)=5 period horizon, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect the recent high average (avg of P16-P17 is ~210). I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Period 16-17 average demand is 210.5, a 140% increase over the May average of 86.4. Lead time appears stable at 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime for T-shirts (SKU 711053003). Period 16 (243), Period 17 (178), and Period 18 (132) show a sustained increase in demand compared to the May average of 86.4. The current mean for this summer regime (P16-P18) is 184.3. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) due to the zero arrival in Periods 17 and 18, which followed the very small orders placed in Periods 13 and 14 (likely due to previous overstock). We are now in a stockout situation. The pipeline inventory (707 units) consists of orders from P15 (40), P16 (96), P17 (236), and P18 (335). The P15 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 19 resolution. To capture the current summer peak and high volatility, I will use a 3-period window (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the regime shift that started in Period 16. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 (late June), entering the peak summer season for T-shirts. Demand has surged significantly: over the last 4 periods (P16-P19), demand has averaged 206.5 units (243, 178, 132, 273), compared to the May average of ~86. This confirms the summer demand regime shift noted in previous carry-over insights. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the small arrival in P19 (40 units) was immediately exhausted by the high demand (273). However, we have a large pipeline (944 units in-transit). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P15 order arrived in P19). The OR backend must now account for this significantly higher demand level to maintain service levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand summer regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The L parameter remains at the promised default of 4.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed summer demand regime (P16-P19): Average demand increased to 206.5 units, a ~140% increase over the May baseline of 86.4 units. High volatility persists (SD ~63).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime for T-shirts (SKU 711053003), with Period 20 demand at 201 units and a 5-period average (P16-P20) of 205.4 units. On-hand inventory is 0, following two periods of stockouts due to the massive demand spike. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P15 order arrived P19, P16 order arrived P20). However, orders from P13 and P14 (totaling 0 units) resulted in no arrivals during P17 and P18, which explains the current stockout. To recover, mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (covering the summer peak) to calculate demand for the (L+1) horizon. Given high summer volatility (SD ~54 in this period), sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to ensure a sufficient service level and avoid further stockouts during this peak season.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22 (July 8), the peak summer season for T-shirts. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by Period 21's arrival (ordered P17, arrived P21). Demand from Period 16 to 21 has averaged 197.8 units, which is a significant increase from the May average. The last six periods of demand are: 243, 178, 132, 273, 201, 160. This reflects the 'Summer Demand Regime' noted in the Carry-Over Insights, though there is high volatility (StDev ~49.5). With an on-hand inventory of 76 and a massive in-transit pipeline of 895 (representing orders from P18, P19, P20, and P21), we must ensure mu_hat reflects this high-demand regime to maintain the base stock level, while the OR engine's pipeline-inventory subtraction and cap will moderate the final order to avoid excessive overstocking when these large shipments arrive. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current summer regime exclusively.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the peak summer season for T-shirts. Demand has been high but volatile (P16-P22 avg: 185; P20-P22 avg: 156.7). The spike of 243/273 in P16/P19 seems to be cooling slightly, but still remains significantly above the May baseline of 86. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (302) due to the arrival of the large P18 order, but with a 4-period lead time, we must maintain a high pipeline to cover demand throughout late July and August. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat (N=7 covers the summer regime from P16-P22) to capture the current high-demand mean (~185) while accounting for the recent slight dip. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=7 to capture the high summer volatility (SD ~61). Note: The large In-transit amount (678) reflects orders from P19-P22 which will arrive in the coming weeks.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is July 22, 2019. The product is a T-shirt, and we are in the peak summer season. Historically, demand for this SKU has shown significant regime shifts: from a spring average of ~100 to a summer average of ~200 starting around Period 16 (late May). Examining the most recent 8 periods (P16-P23), the average demand is 195.6 with a standard deviation of approximately 61. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P19-P23 all confirmed L=4). Although demand in P21 (160), P22 (109), and P23 (268) shows high volatility, the summer regime is still active. I will use a N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume summer phase while smoothing the recent volatility. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for the current demand levels (~1000 units total pipeline target). The OR backend will use these to balance the high stockout cost ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late July (2019/7/29), approaching the end of the high-summer demand season for T-shirts. Period 23 and 24 showed significant demand (268 and 216 units respectively), confirming that the summer regime remains strong and volatile. Over the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the average demand is 186.7 units with a standard deviation of 63.8. Although we currently have 304 units on-hand and 546 in-transit, we must maintain a high base stock to cover demand over the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5). Total pipeline inventory is 850 units. Setting N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this summer regime while smoothing out weekly volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). For a 'Long T-shirt' (product 711053003), demand has been high during the summer months. Recent demand (P20-P25) has averaged 185.5 units with a standard deviation of 56.5. Although the peak summer phase (July) is concluding, August typically maintains high demand for lightweight jersey basics before the autumn transition. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of orders from P17 through P21). Inventory is well-managed with 210 units on hand and 721 units in transit (orders from P22-P25). Given the critical window (L+1=5 periods) and current holding vs profit costs ($1 vs $4), I will use the recent 6 periods (current summer regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure high service levels while tracking the high volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P20-P25) averaged 185.5 units; lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the late summer phase for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand (P20-P26) has shown a slight downward trend compared to the mid-summer peak, averaging 177.5 units, though still significantly higher than the spring baseline. The most recent demand was 121, suggesting the summer peak may be tapering off as we move toward late August. However, to maintain a safe service level and avoid stockouts seen in June/July, I will use a 7-period window (P20-P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the high summer volume while beginning to incorporate the recent softening. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P17 through P22.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU shows a clear seasonal pattern: a spring rise (P1-P5), a peak in early April (P8), a stabilization in May (P13-P15), followed by a significant summer surge starting in late May (P16). However, recent data from P26-P27 (August) shows demand cooling significantly to 121 and 106 units respectively, down from the June/July average of ~185. This suggests the summer peak is ending. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P23 arrival confirmed in P27). I will set L to 'calculate' to use the consistent 4-period history. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent downward trend in demand (averaging ~143 over the last 5 weeks) while still maintaining enough stock for potential late-summer tail demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current volatility as the season transition occurs. Pipeline inventory (729) is high relative to these lower demand levels, so the OR engine will likely moderate new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed in August (P26-P27): Average demand dropped to 113.5 units from a July average of ~185, signaling the end of the summer peak regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tess Tee' (Long T-shirt) is showing a clear cooling trend as the summer peak concludes in late August. Demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) has averaged 108.6 units (121, 106, 99), a significant drop from the July average of ~185. This pattern suggests a return to a mid-range regime similar to the spring average of ~100. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this 'cooling' by using a recent_N of 3 to capture the most recent trend. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the P24 order arriving in P28. Current inventory levels (on-hand 356 + in-transit 551) are relatively high for this lower demand regime, so the OR backend should naturally reduce order quantities to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed (P26-P28): Average demand dropped to 108.7 units, down 41% from the summer peak average (~185), signaling the transition to post-summer demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $690.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the long T-shirt (711053003) has shown significant volatility in late August. After an apparent cooling trend (P26-P28 avg: 108.7), Period 29 saw a sudden spike to 259 units. This suggests either a final summer clearance surge or increased volatility as the season transitions. Current on-hand inventory is healthy (346 units), and the pipeline is also substantial (302 units from P26-P29 orders). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals. Since the demand has become unpredictable (drifting from 100 to 259), I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the recent mean (avg ~146) which balances the cooling observed in early August with the recent spike. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to account for the high standard deviation (approx 74) during this transition phase. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock to cover the high-demand periods without over-ordering if demand returns to the cooling trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late August (Period 29: 259 units), reversing the cooling trend seen in Periods 26-28 (avg 108.7). This suggests a transition phase or late-season spike rather than a steady decline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053003 (Long T-shirt) is currently in a high-volatility transition phase as summer ends and September begins. After a brief cooling period in August (avg ~109 in P27-P28), demand spiked again in P29 (259) and P30 (179), suggesting that while the sustained summer peak of ~185 has passed, replacement or late-season demand remains significant. I will set mu_hat to cover the most recent 5-period average (P26-P30 \u2248 153), which captures both the low and high volatility of the current market. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand levels (274) and significant inventory in transit (421), the OR backend's service level logic (75-80%) should modulate ordering to avoid overstocking while protecting against the current volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 66).

Carry-over insight: Demand transition (late Aug/early Sep): High volatility returned in P29-P30 (avg 219) after a temporary cooling in early August. Demand remains elevated compared to spring levels (~86) but shows high variance (SD ~66 over last 5 periods).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (2019/09/16), the demand for this SKU (Long T-shirt) remains in a high-volatility transition phase typical of late summer/early autumn. Recent demand (P29-P31: 259, 179, 214) has averaged roughly 217 units, significantly reversing the temporary drop seen in early August. This suggests a sustained late-season lift. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P27 order arriving in P31). Based on the most recent 6 periods (P26-P31), the mean demand is 179.7 units with high variance. I will use recent_N=6 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, elevated demand state while the OR engine manages the trade-off between the $4.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost. On-hand is 136 with a large pipeline of 541, so the OR backend will moderate the order size accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in September (P29-P31 avg: 217), indicating a secondary late-season peak rather than a decline to spring levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (Sept 23, 2019), the T-shirt SKU '711053003' is experiencing a sustained secondary peak in demand late in the season. Over the last four periods (P29-P32), demand has averaged 198.25 units (259, 179, 214, 141), which is significantly higher than the early-August cooling phase (avg ~109) and nearly reaches mid-summer levels. Although Period 32 demand was lower (141), the overall volatility in September remains high (SD of last 4 periods \u2248 50). Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 114 and a pipeline of 683 units, the backend needs to maintain coverage for 5 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-season high-volatility regime, ensuring the OR backend balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost with an appropriate base stock level.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (2019-09-30), we are exiting September and entering October. Recent demand patterns show a secondary peak in September (P29-P33 average: 186 units) compared to the late-August cooling (P26-P28 average: 108.7). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 29 order (expected in P33) has not yet concluded\u2014note that Period 29 had an 'ordered=0' value, meaning we are effectively waiting for the Period 30 order (226 units) to arrive in Period 34. This explains the stockout in P33. To address the persistent high demand and volatility (SD ~60 over the last 10 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the September peak of ~186) and sigma_hat with recent_N=10 to reflect the broad volatility seen throughout the summer and transition months. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (P29-P33) confirmed a secondary peak with an average of 186 units, reversing the late-August cooling trend. High volatility persists into early autumn.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07. We are entering October, and the product is a 'Long T-shirt', which may see sustained or even slightly increasing demand as temperatures drop, although the primary summer peak has passed. Demand in Period 34 dropped significantly to 87 from an average of ~186 in the preceding weeks (P29-P33). However, given the high volatility observed throughout September (SD ~66), this could be a temporary fluctuation rather than a definitive downward regime shift. The 'Carry-over insights' correctly identify a secondary peak in September. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P30 order arrived in P34). Pipeline inventory is high (843 units). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the September average (~160) while acknowledging the recent drop, and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to account for the persistent high volatility (SD ~60+). This approach maintains a safety buffer for potential October demand while being cautious of the high pipeline and potential late-season cooling.

Carry-over insight: October demand transition: Period 34 shows a significant drop (87 units) compared to the September average (186 units), potentially signaling the end of the secondary peak as autumn progresses.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the T-shirt SKU '711053003' is transitioning into a lower-demand autumn regime. Recent demand in Periods 34 and 35 (87 and 95 units respectively) shows a significant decrease from the September secondary peak (avg ~186), appearing to stabilize around the May baseline (~86 units). On-hand inventory is healthy at 240 units, with 658 units in-transit. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P31 order arrived in P35). To avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs during this cooling phase, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the recent lower-demand regime. Using recent_N with N=3 for demand parameters captures the shift from the September peak to the current October levels (Periods 33-35 avg: 119.6 units). This ensures the base stock reflects current consumption rates while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime shift confirmed (P34-P35): Demand has returned to spring-like levels (avg 91 units), a ~50% reduction from the September secondary peak (avg 186).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Long T-shirt) has clearly transitioned into a lower-volume autumn regime. Over the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has averaged 96.7 units (87, 95, 108), which is a significant drop from the September secondary peak average of 186 units. This aligns with seasonal expectations for short-sleeve t-shirts in late October. On-hand inventory is currently high (393 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the September peak (e.g., 261 units from P32). Pipeline inventory (397 units) includes the large P33 order (281 units) which is expected to arrive this period (P37). Given the current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 790) and the new lower demand regime (~97 units/period), we are significantly overstocked for the next (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 485 units). Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the new autumn baseline and continue to minimize ordering to bleed off excess inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28. Following the secondary September peak (avg ~186), demand has settled into a lower autumn regime. Periods 34-37 show demands of 87, 95, 108, and 185, with the 185 in P37 being a likely late-October outlier or final clearance spike. Excluding the outlier, the autumn average is around 100-110 units. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 489) due to the large orders placed during the September peak arriving now (P32 and P33 orders arrived in P36 and P37). With On-hand = 489 and In-transit = 116, the total pipeline is 605 units. Given the lower expected demand (approx 100-110/week) and a lead time of 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked for the current regime (605 vs. required ~500-550 for L+1). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current autumn stabilization while accounting for the recent volatility, which will result in no new orders being placed to allow inventory to bleed down.

Carry-over insight: Late October outlier: Period 37 demand spiked to 185 units, deviating from the established October baseline of ~95 units. Monitor P38 to see if this is a sustained shift or a one-off event.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (early November), we are observing a potential late-season volatility or shift. Demand in P37 (185) and P38 (146) has consecutive spikes above the October baseline of ~95. This suggests that while autumn usually sees lower demand for T-shirts, there is currently a secondary uptick or significant variance (P37-P38 average: 165.5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P34 order arrived in P38). On-hand inventory is high (448) due to large orders placed during the September secondary peak arriving now. Given the high on-hand and pipeline inventory (448 + 85 = 533), which covers nearly 4 periods of even the spiked demand levels, I will keep mu_hat and sigma_hat focused on the recent regime (P34-P38, N=5) to capture this recent increase without over-ordering into the winter season. The service level target (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) suggests the OR backend will naturally be conservative with the current high stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility/uptick shift detected late October (P37-P38): Average demand rose to 165.5 units, reversing the early October decline (~95 units).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40 (2019/11/11), we are observing high volatility in November demand. After a late-October uptick (avg 165.5), Period 39 dropped back to 85 units. This inconsistency suggests a highly variable demand environment as we approach the end of the year. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P35 arrival). On-hand inventory is healthy at 374 units, with 239 in-transit. Given the recent fluctuation (185, 146, 85), I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to capture this increased variance and the lower most-recent mean, while keeping the lead time method at calculate to reflect the stable 4-period history. I'll set N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include the spike from Period 37 and the subsequent decline, providing a balanced forecast for the OR backend.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in mid-November (Period 41). Recent demand has been highly volatile: P37 (185), P38 (146), P39 (85), and P40 (162). This volatility suggests a transition or late-season 'Long T-shirt' relevance as weather cools, rather than a steady decline. The average demand over the last 4 periods is 144.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 212 units, and in-transit is 323 units (total 535). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P34 and P35 arrivals. Given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, the OR backend targets an ~80% service level. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this recent volatile/elevated regime, which translates to a base stock target of roughly (1+L)*144.5 = 722.5 units plus safety stock. With 535 units already in the system, the OR backend will calculate a modest order to reach this target, effectively cushioning against the current high volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), we are approaching the end of the year (P47). The demand has been highly volatile in November, with Period 40 at 162 units and Period 41 dropping to 59 units. The previous seasonal cycle for this SKU (long T-shirt) showed a massive jump in demand around April/May and July. Given the current date (late November), we should anticipate potential Black Friday or holiday-related spikes, though the immediate trend has cooled. On-hand inventory is 153, and we have a large pipeline of 538 units (ordered in Periods 38-41). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have sufficient stock arriving to cover the remaining 5 periods of the game (total pipeline > expected demand for 5 periods), I will set mu_hat using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current volatility while relying on the backend capped policy to prevent over-ordering as the game concludes.

Carry-over insight: November demand remains highly volatile (Range: 59-162) following a late-October uptick. The pipeline (538 units) combined with on-hand (153) is significantly higher than the 5-period trailing average (approx 127/week), suggesting high coverage for the remaining 5 periods of the game.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019) with only 5 periods remaining in the game. Current on-hand inventory is 101 units, and the pipeline is very large at 511 units (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). Total physical coverage (on-hand + in-transit) is 612 units. Given the recent demand volatility (P38-P42 average of 115.6 units/week), this provides over 5 weeks of coverage, matching the remaining game duration. The order from P39 (165 units) is expected to arrive this period (P43). As we approach the end of the simulation, the priority shifts from aggressive replenishment to avoiding terminal holding costs. With the pipeline already sufficient to cover expected demand through Period 47, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma estimation to capture the current volatile regime but expect the OR backend's capping mechanism to minimize unnecessary end-of-game orders.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9) of a 47-period game. Demand has entered a declining/cooling phase in early December, with the last period's demand dropping to 53 from a previous range of 59-162 in November. Currently, on-hand inventory is 213 and in-transit is 393, totaling 606 units of coverage. Given there are only 4 periods remaining in the game (44, 45, 46, 47) and the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 44) will arrive in Period 48 (44 + 4), which is AFTER the game ends. Therefore, placing additional orders is unnecessary and would only increase holding costs without contributing to sales or profit. I am setting the lead time L to the default promised value (4) and using a recent_N (N=4) approach for demand parameters to reflect the recent softening in late Q4, though the OR backend's capped policy will prioritize current inventory over new ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed in early December (P43 demand: 53), following a volatile November (avg ~108). Remaining inventory and pipeline (606 units) significantly exceed the total expected demand for the final 4 periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-122.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47, specifically in mid-December (2019/12/16). The game ends at the conclusion of Period 47. Any order placed now (Period 45) with a lead time of 4 would arrive in Period 49, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, ordering more units is unnecessary. Current inventory (On-hand: 262) and in-transit units (309) provide a total coverage of 571 units. Even at the highest recent monthly average demand (~120-130), this overwhelmingly covers the remaining 3 periods (45, 46, and 47). Recent demand has also cooled significantly (P43: 53, P44: 35), suggesting a low-demand winter regime. To avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 3 to reflect this downward trend, while the OR backend's capped policy will ensure no new orders are placed as the pipeline exceeds any reasonable base stock level.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game de-stocking phase: Current inventory and pipeline (571 units) exceed maximum possible demand for the remaining 3 periods. Late December demand (P44: 35) confirms a seasonal trough.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47, which is the penultimate period. The game ends at the conclusion of Period 47. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 46) would not arrive until Period 50 (46+4), which is well beyond the game's horizon. Current status: On-hand inventory is 430 units. Recent demand has been significantly lower (Period 43-45 average: 45 units), reflecting a late-December seasonal trough for T-shirts. Even if demand were to return to its historical maximum (approx. 273), the 430 units on hand are more than sufficient to cover the remaining two periods of demand (P46 + P47). Any additional orders would only increase holding costs and ending inventory without contributing to revenue. Therefore, I am setting the parameters to trigger a zero order. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 0 to ensure the backend base stock stays below the existing pipeline + on-hand inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 47 (Final Period). The game ends after this decision phase. Any order placed now would arrive in Period 51 (Lead Time = 4), meaning it will never be sold. Furthermore, current on-hand inventory is 357 units, and 47 units are in-transit (expected to arrive this period). Total available inventory (404) is far more than enough to cover the demand for this final period, which has been averaging around 60-70 units recently. Since any new order would only incur holding costs if it arrived, or simply be a wasted capital expense if it didn't, the optimal strategy for the final period is to order zero. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 and use recent averages (N=5) for demand and volatility to provide the OR backend with the most accurate current state, though the policy should naturally order zero given the 4-period lead time and ample stock.
