Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Brazilian briefs' (underwear), which typically shows stable demand but might see a slight increase around Valentine's Day. The historical data (5 samples: 114, 133, 148, 86, 129) has a mean of 122 and a standard deviation of 23.9. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. The promised lead time is 4, so we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'default' methods to leverage all available historical samples for the initial order, as there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or lead-time deviation beyond the promise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is lace Brazilian briefs, a lingerie staple. Historical demand analysis shows: Jan-07 (114), Jan-14 (133), Jan-21 (148), Jan-28 (86), Feb-04 (129), and Period 1 demand was 85. The mean demand across these 6 samples is approximately 116 units/period. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 161 in-transit (ordered in P1). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, this P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5 arrival resolution; we won't see it until Period 6 START. No arrivals were expected in Period 1. Since L=4, we must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 6 samples as our regime, the estimated demand for the lead time plus review period (mu_hat) is 5 * 116 = 580. Sigma calculation: Standard deviation of {114, 133, 148, 86, 129, 85} is approximately 25.04. Over L+1 periods, sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 25.04 \u2248 56. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the established demand baseline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Brazilian briefs' (lingerie/underwear), which generally has steady demand but can see minor peaks around late February/early March (post-Valentine's Day cycles). Historical demand (5 samples) averages 122 units/period. In Period 1 and 2, demand was 85 and 113 respectively; both were lost sales because starting on-hand was 0 and no arrivals occurred. Promised lead time is 4. Orders placed in P1 (161 units) are expected to arrive in P5 (visible in P6 conclude), and P2 (159 units) in P6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 320 in-transit. Since we have no completed arrival cycles yet, I will use 'default' for lead time and sigma. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (including the 5 pre-game samples) to capture the base demand level of roughly 122/period. With (1+L)=5, mu_hat should target approximately 610 units.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is Women's Lingerie (Brazilian briefs). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3, but since the lead time is 4, we don't expect the first arrival until Period 5's conclusion (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales, which is expected during the initial lead time ramp-up. Historical demand samples (114, 133, 148, 86, 129) and recent period demands (85, 113, 98) show a relatively stable mean. The average of the 8 available data points is approximately 114. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use 'default' for L as there is no evidence yet to suggest the promised 4-period lead time is incorrect. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the 5 historical samples + 3 game periods) to capture the base demand level. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect observed volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU is a women's lingerie item. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, P3, and P4 have not yet arrived, which is consistent with a 4-period lead time (the P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 and will be visible in the P6 conclude message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 567 units in-transit. Demand since the start of the game (P1-P4: 85, 113, 98, 90) combined with historical samples suggests a stable mean around 110-120 units per period. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5), which means the base stock should target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most recent history while smoothed by the initial samples.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is lace Brazilian briefs, a stable lingerie item. Historical demand (5 samples + 5 concluded periods) shows a mean of approximately 105 units/week (85, 113, 98, 90, 64 in the game history; 114, 133, 148, 86, 129 in samples). The Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. In-transit inventory (406 units) corresponds to orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5 (159+152+95+0 = 406). Current on-hand is 97. Total pipeline + on-hand is 503. With L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 105 = 525. My current position (503) is slightly below the expected demand for the lead time horizon. However, demand decreased in the most recent period (64). I will use the default lead time (4) and use a recent_N strategy for demand (N=5) to capture the slightly downward trend in the most recent concluded game periods compared to the initial samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-25 (Period 7). The product is a women's lingerie item. Analysis of the 5 pre-game samples (Avg: 122) and the first 6 game periods shows a notable demand shift. Demand in Periods 1-4 averaged 96.5 units, but dropped to an average of 62.5 units in Periods 5-6. This suggests the initial demand surge might have been a seasonal peak or launch effect that is now stabilizing at a lower level. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being met exactly (orders from P1 and P2 arrived in P5 and P6 respectively). I have 195 units on hand and 247 in transit (from P3 and P4 orders), which covers approximately 7 periods of current demand. Given high holding costs relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0), I must be cautious of overstocking. I will use a recent window (recent_N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the downward trend while maintaining a buffer. I'll stick with default lead-time settings as the observed matches the promised.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is lace Brazilian briefs, a stable lingerie item. Historical demand analysis shows a clear shift: Periods 1-4 (Pre-arrival stockout phase) showed higher potential demand (mean ~96.5), while Periods 5-7 (Post-arrival on-hand phase) show lower realized demand (mean ~57.7). This drop from ~96 to ~58 suggests a regime change or that initial demand signals were noisier. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Pipeline inventory is 95 (ordered P4), expected to arrive in Period 4+4=8 (visible in P9). On-hand is 299. Given the lower recent demand (avg 57.7), our total coverage requirements (L+1 = 5 periods) suggest we need approximately 288 units (5 * 57.7). Since current on-hand (299) + in-transit (95) = 394, we are currently overstocked relative to the recent demand trend. I will set mu_hat using the recent 3 samples (N=3) to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent further excessive ordering while holding costs equal profit ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 5: weekly demand decreased from ~96 to ~58 (-40%); Lead time confirmed at 4 periods across three consecutive arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The historical demand showed a significant drop around Period 5, moving from a mean of ~118 units/week (pre-game + early game) to approximately 55 units/week over the last 4 periods (P5-P8). This shift is documented in the carry-over insights. Lead time is stable and confirmed at the promised 4 periods (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 346 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lower demand regime (avg 55), the current stock covers approximately 6.3 weeks of demand, which exceeds the required base-stock level (calculated for L+1 = 5 weeks). With profit ($1.0) equal to holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the backend aims to cover the expected demand (mu_hat) exactly. Our goal is to prevent the OR engine from ordering more until inventory depletes. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current lower demand mean (~55) and standard deviation for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for L as the lead time has been perfectly consistent.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019 (Period 10). The item is women's lace Brazilian briefs. We are currently in a lower demand regime that began around Period 5 (March 11). Demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) has averaged 50.6 units/period (64, 61, 48, 48, 32), which is significantly lower than the pre-P5 average of ~112. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods based on several consecutive arrivals. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 314 units. Given \u03bc\u0302 for calculation is (1+L) \xd7 mean, with L=4, \u03bc\u0302 is roughly 5 \xd7 50 = 250 units. Since our current inventory of 314 units exceeds the expected requirement to cover 5 periods of demand at the current rate (and accounting for holding costs equal to profit), the OR backend will likely place a zero order. I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the current regime's volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '611415001' (Womens Brazilian briefs) is currently in Period 11 (late April). The demand regime shift noted in period 8 has continued to decline further; demand in the last two periods (9 and 10) was 32 and 29, which is significantly lower than the ~58 average previously observed. This suggests a continued downward trend or stabilization at a very low level as we move further from the early-year peak. I am currently holding 285 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, my total coverage (on-hand + pipeline) needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). At a current demand rate of ~30/week, I have nearly 10 weeks of stock. To minimize high holding costs ($1.0/unit), I need to stop ordering and let inventory deplete. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower demand regime (periods 5-10) and use 'calculate' for L as the lead time of 4 is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: Weekly demand for Periods 9-10 averaged ~30, down from the ~58 average in Periods 5-8.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand shows a persistent downward trend for this SKU (Womens Lingerie / Brazilian briefs). Initial demand (P1-P4) averaged ~96, followed by a drop to ~55 (P5-P8), and most recently stabilized at ~30 (P9-P11). There are no pending shipments (In-transit: 0), and current On-hand inventory (256) is extremely high relative to the current weekly demand of ~30. With a lead time of 4 periods, a (1+L) coverage requires inventory for 5 periods, approximately 150 units (30 * 5). Our 256 units on-hand already far exceed this, and the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0 each). To minimize further holding cost while account for the new demand level, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent regime (~30 units/week). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 9-11 demand stable at ~30 units/week, down 70% from initial levels.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is womens lingerie (Brazilian briefs). Historical data showed an initial demand of ~110-120, which dropped to ~58 in Period 5, and then stabilized at ~30-35 starting Period 9. In the most recent period (Period 12), demand ticked up to 49, potentially indicating a minor fluctuation or the end of the lowest demand trough. However, our current on-hand inventory is 207 units. With an estimated weekly demand of ~35-40 and a lead time of 4 periods (L+1=5), our 'protection level' needs to cover approximately 175-200 units. Since on-hand inventory (207) already exceeds this level and there are no units in-transit, the OR backend will naturally result in a zero order. To reflect the stabilized but slightly fluctuating recent demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (since the shift to the ~30-50 range) and use 'calculate' for lead time as the 4-period duration has been consistent.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Charlotte Brazilian Aza.Low 2p' (lingerie), which has shown a significant demand drop since the initial period. Period 1-4 averaged ~96 units/week, Period 5-8 averaged ~55, and Period 9-13 averaged ~37. Recent demands in Period 12 (49) and Period 13 (46) suggest a slight stabilization or uptick from the mid-30s. Since on-hand inventory is 161 and the promised lead time is 4 periods, we are looking at (1+L) = 5 periods of demand coverage. 5 periods * ~40 units/week = 200 units. Our current on-hand of 161 is below this requirement. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (approx 42 units/week). L remains at the promised 4 periods as history consistently confirms this.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 611415001 shows three distinct regimes: initially ~100-120 units (Periods 1-4), then a drop to ~58 (Periods 5-8), followed by a low of ~30 (Periods 9-11). However, the last three periods (12, 13, and 14) show a significant rebound in demand (49, 46, and 96 respectively), suggesting a new upward trend or seasonal recovery. Period 14 demand (96) is the highest seen in 10 weeks. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 65, in-transit 24), totaling 89 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals confirm L=4 is consistent. To avoid stockouts during this recovery phase, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent demand surge (average ~64 per week). Over 5 periods (L+1), this requires ~320 units. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery detected starting Period 12: demand has risen from a low of 30 to a peak of 96 in Period 14, averaging ~64 over the last 3 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '611415001' is currently in a significant demand surge peaking at 122 units in Period 15, which has led to a stockout (on-hand is 0). Demand over the last four periods has increased from 49 to 122, averaging 78.25 units/week. Since the dates (late May) correspond with the lead-up to summer, and the product is lingerie/underwear briefs, this recovery is sustained by seasonality. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. With on-hand at 0 and 134 units in-transit (ordered in P14 and P15), we must ensure the base stock covers demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat captures the current uptrend better than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this period of high volatility to ensure the OR backend increases the safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed as seasonal: weekly demand increased from ~30 in April to an average of ~80 in May (Periods 12-15), peaking at 122.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal phase (June/late Spring for women's lingerie). Historical data from the last 5 periods (P12-P16) shows a mean weekly demand of 76.4 units (49, 46, 96, 122, 69). The drop in Period 16 to 69 units after a peak of 122 suggests volatility, but the overall trend is significantly higher than the April trough (~30). With on-hand inventory at 0 and current demand exceeding previous supply cadence, we need to maintain a robust base stock. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on early history. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture this recent seasonal level (moving averages) and use the standard deviation of that same window to handle the heightened volatility (ranging from 46 to 122).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak confirmed: June demand averaging ~76 units/week compared to April average of ~32 units/week (+137% increase).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 382 units in-transit. Demand is currently in a seasonal peak (June average of ~76 units/week). The last four demands were 96, 122, 69, and 60. The drop in the last two periods follows a very high spike of 122, suggesting we are in a higher-demand regime compared to the April lows (avg ~30). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders placed in P14 (24 units), P15 (110 units), P16 (140 units), and P17 (108 units) are all in-transit. The P14 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 18 resolution phase (visible P19), but it is small (24 units), while current demand is averaging ~75+. We are currently stock-outed. To recover and support the (L+1)=5 period window, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (P14-P17) which capture this higher-demand seasonal regime (avg = 86.75). Setting N=4 for mu_hat resulting in (1+4)*86.75 = 433.75. Given the high stock-out risk and volatility (60 to 122), I will use the recent N for sigma_hat as well.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June), currently facing a stockout with On-hand=0. The demand remains in a seasonal peak regime (averaging ~76 units/week since June started). Period 18 conclude confirmed that lead time is exactly 4 periods (order from P14 arrived at P18). The orders placed in Periods 15, 16, and 17 (totaling 358 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 19, 20, and 21 respectively. The current on-hand is 0, but an arrival of 110 units (ordered Period 15) is expected during this period's arrival resolution phase. To calculate mu_hat, I'm focusing on the current seasonal peak (May/June), using N=7 (Periods 12-18) where demand shifted from the April low (~30) to the current average of ~76. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher summer demand levels. Method 'calculate' for L is used as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand plateau confirmed for June: demand averaging ~77 units/week (Periods 14-18) following the April trough of ~30. Lead time consistency at 4 periods verified by P14 order arriving P18.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is late June (2019/6/24). Historically, we've seen a demand trough in April (~30 units/week) followed by a seasonal rise in May/June, stabilizing at an average of ~77 units/week (last 6 periods average: 96, 122, 69, 60, 85, 54 = 81; last 4 periods average: 69, 60, 85, 54 = 67). The product is womens lace lingerie, which usually sees stable summer demand after a spring buildup. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P14 arrived P18, P15 arrived P19). Current on-hand is 56, and we have a significant pipeline of 300 units (ordered P16, P17, P18) expected to arrive in P20, P21, and P22 respectively. Given the profit vs. holding cost ratio (1:1), we aim for a roughly 50% service level which the OR backend will calculate via the critical fractile. Based on the most recent 6 periods of the 'growth/plateau' regime, the mean demand is ~81 units per week. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this summer level while excluding the April lows.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Demand for this lingerie SKU exhibited a seasonal peak in May/early June (averaging ~80 units/week) but has settled into a plateau in late June, with the last two periods (P19-20) averaging 48.5 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P14-P16 orders arrived exactly on schedule). Inventory levels have recovered: On-hand is 153, and arrivals from P17 (108 units) and P18 (52 units) are expected in P21 and P22 respectively. Total pipeline (OH + In-transit) is 362 units. Given the transition from the mid-year peak into July, I am using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current post-peak demand level (~68 units/week) while tapering off from the May highs. This N=7 covers the period from P14 to P20, encompassing the peak and the subsequent stabilization to ensure sufficient but not excessive stock for the (L+1=5) period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak stabilization: Demand has decreased from a May/June average of ~80 to a late-June average of ~48 units/week (P19-20).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8, 2019. Demand for women's lingerie (brazilian briefs) peaked in May/June and is now showing signs of volatility as it potentially transitions out of the seasonal peak. Period 21 saw a significant spike in demand (110 units) compared to the previous two periods (avg ~48), indicating that while the 'peak' might have passed, there is still high variability. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals from Periods 14, 15, 16, and 17. The on-hand inventory is currently 151, with 117 units in-transit (orders from P18, P20, and P21). To manage the current volatility and avoid stockouts from unexpected spikes while accounting for the recent cooling trend, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) over the last 8 periods (covering the transition from May peak to July) to capture the current mean more accurately. For sigma_hat, I will also use the last 8 periods to reflect the heightened volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in early July: Period 21 demand (110) spiked significantly against the late-June average (~48), suggesting unstable stabilization post-seasonal peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 611415001 is currently in a high-demand phase entering mid-July (2019/7/15). After a seasonal peak in May/June and a brief dip to ~48 units in late June, demand has spiked again significantly in Periods 21 and 22 (110 and 129 units respectively). The average demand over the last two periods is 119.5, which is much higher than the 'post-peak stabilization' predicted previously. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P18 order arrived P22). To cover the incoming high demand and avoid the stockouts seen in P15-P18, I am setting mu_hat to reflect this recent surge. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the transition from the dip into the current high-demand regime (last 3 periods: 110, 110, 129; avg ~116). sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility (from 43 to 129 units). L is maintained at the promised/calculated 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: units surged from late-June average of ~48 back to a high-demand regime of ~116 units/week (P21-22 average); volatility has increased alongside volume.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (2019-07-22), the SKU '611415001' is in a high-demand recovery/summer peak phase. After a late-June dip, demand surged significantly in July, with the last three periods (P21-23) recording 110, 129, and 87 units respectively (average ~109). The stockout at the end of Period 23 (74 sold vs 87 demand) confirms the current on-hand inventory is insufficient for this high-volume regime. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on order-arrival history (P18-P22). To capture the current July demand level and mitigate stockouts, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to specifically weight the current high-demand regime (+/- 109 units/week). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the increased volatility observed during this volume surge. Lead time L is set to 'default', as the promised 4 periods matches observed actuals.

Carry-over insight: July demand surge confirmed: Demand for P21-23 averaged 109 units/week, a significant increase from the late-June average of 48. Stockout occurred in Period 23 due to this regime shift.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '611415001' (Womens Lingerie) is experiencing high demand volatility and stockouts in late July. Demand for the last 4 periods (P21-P24) has been 110, 129, 87, and 72, averaging ~99.5 units/week. This is a significant regime shift compared to the June average of ~48. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as evidenced by P20's order arriving in P24). Consequently, the OR parameters must reflect this high-demand July/August regime. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent surge while maintaining a high service level through the OR backend's z-score calculation (since profit=holding_cost, the target service level is 50%, but the backend capping logic and safety stock will help mitigate further stockouts). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 4 weeks of higher demand.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed for July (P21-P24): demand averaged 99.5 units/week, up from ~48 in June. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26 (August 5), we are navigating a high-demand regime in July/August that has caused repeated stockouts (P23-P25) due to inventory arriving late relative to the rapid demand spike. Demand in P25 was 138, and the average for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is approximately 107.2 units/week, significantly higher than the previous June average of ~48. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with 482 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P21 order arrived P25). To recover from the stockouts and meet this sustained high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the July surge (Period 21 onwards). This will elevate the base stock to cover the expected 100+ weekly demand during the lead time plus the current period (L+1=5). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime in July/August confirmed: Demand for P21-P25 averaged 107.2 units/week (+123% vs June average of 48). Sustained stockouts occurred P23-P25 due to demand outstripping the prior lower-volume pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27 (mid-August), the SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in July. Over the last 6 periods (P21-P26), demand has averaged 108.2 units per week with a standard deviation of approximately 24.8. This represents a significant shift from the June average of approximately 48 units per week. Although on-hand inventory recovered slightly to 14 units at the start of Period 27 following an arrival of 127 units in Period 26, the system has dealt with stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods due to this surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P20, P21, and P22). To maintain appropriate service levels while balancing the high holding cost (equal to profit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (P21-P26) while ignoring the previous lows of April-June. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock reflective of the contemporary 100+ units/week environment.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime for July/August confirmed: P21-P26 demand average is 108.2 units/week, a +125% increase over the June average of 48.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 21. For the most recent 7 periods (P21-P27), demand has averaged 104.4 units/week, which is a significant increase from the June average of ~48. While there was a slight dip in the most recent period (82 units), the overall trend remains high and volatile. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P23 order arriving in P27). I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while allowing for recent volume stabilization. The backend calculated base stock and order cap will use these parameters to maintain a safety buffer against the observed volatility (std dev ~26) and ensure the pipeline pipeline (+358 units) is sufficient to meet demand over the next 5 periods (L+1).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 611415001 is currently in a sustained high-demand regime throughout July and August. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P21-P28) is 102.3 units/week. While the most recent demand in Period 28 was 86, the overall trend since early July indicates a mean significantly higher than the previous June low. On-hand inventory is 159, and 'In-transit' is 278, which includes expected arrivals from orders placed in P25, P26, P27, and P28. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 28 conclude message for the Period 24 order). I will use a recent_N approach with N=8 to capture this high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this higher volume to maintain service levels while accounting for current inventory and the full pipeline.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime for July/August (P21-P28) confirmed: demand average is 102.3 units/week, up from the June average of ~48 (+113%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 21. For the window P21-P29, demand has averaged approximately 104.8 units per week (sum: 110+129+87+72+138+113+82+86+125 = 942 / 9). The most recent demand (P29) was 125, which is above this average, indicating continued strength as we move into September. On-hand inventory is 76 units. In-transit inventory is 310 units (from orders in P26, P27, P28, P29). Lead time has remained perfectly stable at 4 periods (P25 order arrived P29). I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current volatility and volume. Lead time calculation remains stable.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime for July/August/September (P21-P29) confirmed: demand average is 104.8 units/week, significantly higher than the June average of ~48.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 611415001 is in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 21 (early July). For the period P21-P30, demand has averaged approximately 107.2 units per week. Although there were stockouts in periods P23, P24, P25, and most recently P30 (ending OH=0, sold=130 vs demand=131), the high-demand signal remains robust. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P26 order arrived in P30). With On-hand inventory at 0 and significant upcoming demand, I will continue to use a recent_N approach to capture this regime while slightly increasing N to 10 to smooth out recent volatility while maintaining the high mean. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand at this high level.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime for July/August/September (P21-P30) confirmed: demand average is 107.2 units/week (+123% vs June average). Stockout in P30 confirms continued high demand pressure.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a sustained high-demand regime that began in July (Period 21). From P21 to P30, the average demand was approximately 107 units/week. While P31 saw a lower demand of 49, this appears to be a weekly fluctuation rather than a regime shift, as previous periods (e.g., P27 was 82, P28 was 86) also showed relative dips before returning to levels >120. To maintain a high service level given the $1/unit profit and $1/unit holding cost (suggesting a 50% target service level), I will use the last 11 periods (P21-P31) to capture this regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 ensures the OR backend accounts for the current volume (+107 units/week) and its significant volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 21. For the period P21-P32, the average weekly demand is approximately 99.5 units. Recent demand (P31-P32) has softened slightly to 49 and 62, which might indicate a cooling off from the July/August peak, but volatility remains present. Given the 1$ profit vs 1$ holding cost, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To balance the stock-out risk seen in P30 with the significant holding costs of this 1:1 ratio, I am using recent_N=12 to capture the entirety of the current high-demand regime while allowing the recent dips to moderate the forecast slightly. This N covers the regime shift evidence from the carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 remains elevated but showed potentially lower volume in P31-P32 (avg 55.5) compared to the P21-P30 average (~107). Monitoring for a post-summer downward shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a highly volatile demand phase. While the summer peak (P21-P30) averaged ~107 units/week, the last three periods (P31-P33) have shown a significant split: P31 and P32 were low (~55 units), but P33 spiked to 163 units, causing a total stockout (on-hand is 0). This suggests that despite a potential seasonal tapering, demand remains dangerously high and unpredictable. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P29 order arrived P33). Given the current stockout and the spike in P33, I will set mu_hat to capture the broader high-demand regime from Period 21 to Period 33 (N=13) to ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient base stock to recover from the stockout and handle future spikes. This average (approx 98.7 units) is more conservative than the 10-period peak but higher than the recent low, providing a robust buffer for the (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand volatility confirmed: Period 33 demand of 163 units is the highest recorded, occurring immediately after a two-period lull (avg 55.5). The high-demand regime starting Period 21 persists but with significantly increased variance.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that began in July (Period 21). Over the last 14 periods (P21-P34), demand has averaged 102.1 units/week, but with significant swings (from 49 to 163). Recent demand (P31-P34) shows a volatile pattern with an average of 89.75. The spike in P33 (163) followed by a moderate P34 (85) suggests that despite fluctuations, the base demand remains high. I will use N=14 to capture this entire high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P30 order arriving in P34. Pipeline inventory is currently 370 units, and on-hand is 53. Setting parameters to cover (L+1) demand ensures we maintain enough stock to handle the high variance observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: High-demand regime (starting P21) continues through early October; average demand for P21-P34 is 102.1 units/week with high variance (STD ~34.5).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the product 'Charlotte Brazilian Aza.Low 2p' remains in a high-demand regime that began around Period 21. Recent demand has been highly volatile, with an average demand of approximately 95 units per week over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), peaking as high as 163. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on systematic historical arrivals. I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the full breadth of the high-demand summer/autumn regime (P21 onwards), which provides a stable mean of ~102 units/week (total mu_hat of 510 for L+1). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=15 to account for the significantly increased variance observed since Period 21, ensuring the OR backend builds sufficient safety stock for these demand spikes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The high-demand regime that began in July (Period 21) persists, with demand for the last 5 periods (P32-P36) averaging 98 units/week. While P31-P32 showed a temporary dip, the P33 spike (163) and subsequent readings (85, 87, 78) confirm that we must maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts, especially given the high variance observed recently (STD ~35-40). The Lead Time remains stable at a confirmed 4 periods (P32 order arrived P36). I will use the last 15 periods (since P21) to capture this 'high-demand' regime's mean and volatility, which effectively covers the July-October behavior. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) = 5 week lead time plus review period, ensuring we have enough inventory to cover the approx 100 units/week demand while managing the significant variance.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P21-P36) remains active with a mean of ~101 units/week and increased volatility (STD ~32) compared to the spring/early summer levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 37, the average weekly demand is approximately 101.5 units, though with significant volatility (highs of 163, lows of 49). The current inventory state is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 37 (demand 136 surpassed on-hand 99). Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. To stabilize availability while managing the high variance observed in recent periods, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 17 (covering the high-demand regime since P21) to capture the current mean of ~102 units/week. I will use the same window for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (STD ~32) seen in this period. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current L+1 protection window (approx. 510 units) considering both the mean shift and the high variance.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 21. Demand remains elevated and volatile (late October demand reached 151 units). Period 38 ended with a very low on-hand inventory of 8 units. Lead time has been exceptionally stable at 4 periods. Since July (P21), demand has averaged approximately 101 units per week with a high standard deviation (approx 32-35). To properly cover the 5-period risk window (L+1), I will use the last 18 periods (the entirety of the high-demand regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend accounts for both the high mean and the significant volatility observed since summer, preventing stockouts during this late-year period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P21-P38) remains sustained through October/November; average demand for this 18-period block is 101.4 units/week with significant volatility (STD ~33.5).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 21. For the period P21-P39, the mean demand is approximately 100.3 units per week, though volatility remains very high (standard deviation approx 33.6) with recent spikes as high as 163. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 42 and demand in the most recent period (P39) at 55, we are at risk of stockout before the next shipment arrives. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 (covering the regime from P21 to P39) to capture the elevated demand level and the significant volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for both the ~100 unit mean and the substantial variance, protecting against further stockouts during this high-volume phase.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (2019/11/18). Historical demand analysis shows a high-demand regime since Period 21 (late July), with a mean of approximately 101 units/week and significant volatility (STD ~33.5). Recent demand in Periods 39-40 (55 and 35 units) suggests a potential seasonal downturn or late-autumn lull, but given the volatility spike seen in Period 33 (163 units) after a similar lull, I must remain cautious. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level (z=0), effectively ordering based on the mean demand. To account for the high-demand regime while acknowledging the recent lower samples, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-July behavior while smoothing out the most recent two-week drop. This balances the risk of a permanent trend shift versus a temporary fluctuation.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-25. We are seeing a significant demand drop in the last three periods (P39: 55, P40: 35, P41: 23), following a sustained high-demand regime that averaged ~101 units/week (P21-P38). The average demand for the last 3 periods is only ~37.7 units/week. This suggests the high-demand 'summer/autumn' regime has ended as we move into late November. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P37 arrival in P41). With 133 units on hand and 338 in-transit (reaching out 4 periods), and demand likely settling into a lower winter regime, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this sharp downward trend and avoid excessive overstocking, while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift detected at Period 39: Weekly demand decreased significantly from the previous ~101 average to ~38 units/week (P39-P41), a -62% reduction signaling a move into a lower winter demand phase.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 611415001 has entered a significant winter low-demand phase starting at Period 39. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P39-P42) is 39.75 units/week, a sharp decrease compared to the previous high-demand regime (~101 units/week). My carry-over insight from Period 42 flagged this shift. Currently, on-hand inventory is 200 units and there are 225 units in-transit (orders from P39-P41), which is more than sufficient to cover the current demand regime over the lead time (L=4). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am selecting recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current lower volume and variance (demand: 55, 35, 23, 46). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P38 order arrived P42).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-313.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the winter period (December). A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 39, with weekly demand dropping from a high-demand average of ~101 to a recent average of 36.4 (Periods 39-43: 55, 35, 23, 46, 23). Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 336 units, which is nearly 10 times the current weekly demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high inventory levels, the priority is to avoid over-ordering during this low-demand phase. mu_hat is set using N=5 to capture the most recent regime (36.4 * 5 = 182). sigma_hat is set using N=5 (std approx 13.9, backend will compute sqrt(5)*std) to reflect the recent decrease in volatility compared to the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (starting P39): Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower average of ~36 units/week (P39-P43), a 64% reduction from the summer/autumn average.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 611415001 has entered a sustained winter low-demand regime starting Period 39. For the last 6 periods (P39-P44), demand has averaged 36.8 units/week, a significant decrease from the summer/autumn average of ~101. Current on-hand inventory is 345 units, which covers nearly 10 weeks of current demand levels. With a lead time of 4 periods and only 3 periods remaining in the game (ending Period 47), the current on-hand plus the 18 units in-transit (expected in Period 45 from the Period 41 order) is more than sufficient. I will maintain the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=6 to reflect this current regime and use 'default' for other parameters to ensure the OR backend generates a zero order, minimizing further holding costs while exhausting current stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-129.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 611415001 has entered a winter phase characterized by lower volume and high holiday-driven volatility. Period 45 saw a demand spike to 117 units, likely due to pre-Christmas shopping, which contrasts with the late-November/early-December average of ~36. Despite this spike, on-hand inventory is high (246 units) relative to recent averages, and we are entering the final two periods of the 47-period horizon. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high inventory and nearing the end of the simulation, the focus is on managing the current surplus rather than initiating new orders which would arrive after the simulation ends (P46 + 4 = P50). I use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat (covering the winter regime P39-P45) to reflect the recent average of ~48.8, while maintaining 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the noted volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 45 demand surged to 117 from a winter average of ~36, indicating high seasonal volatility in December.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the final periods of the year (late December/early January). A holiday demand spike occurred in Periods 45 and 46 (demand of 117 and 135), significantly higher than the winter average of ~36. History shows that demand for 'Womens Lingerie' items often experiences a surge during the December holiday period followed by a significant drop-off in January (as seen in the provided samples: Jan 7 = 114, Jan 14 = 133, but dropping to 86 by Jan 28). Current on-hand inventory is 111. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51. Given the expected post-holiday slump indicated by the late January sample (86 units) and the low winter regime observed in November/early December, setting parameters based on a recent window that captures both the spike and the baseline is prudent. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (P39-P46) to set mu_hat. This window averages the low November demand (~36) with the December spike (~126), resulting in a balanced mu_hat that acknowledges the recent volatility without overreacting to the peak. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=8) to ensure the backend accounts for the high variance between these two phases. L remains 'default' (4) as lead-times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Demand increased from ~36 (Nov/early Dec) to an average of 126 in late December (P45-P46). January samples suggest high early-month demand followed by a late-month decline.
