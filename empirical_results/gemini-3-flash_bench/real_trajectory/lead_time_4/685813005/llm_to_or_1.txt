Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 685813005 (Petar Sweatshirt). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks is [50, 38, 43, 60, 43], giving a mean of 46.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 8.5. Given the dates (Feb 11), we are in a post-winter but still cool-season regime where demand for sweatshirts is likely stable or slightly declining towards spring. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock to cover demand for the lead time (L=4) plus the current review period (1+L=5). I will use the recent N=5 samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent demand patterns. L will be set to the promised 'default' of 4 as we have no historical arrival data to suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a sweatshirt, which typically sees steady demand in late winter/early spring. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, an order of 61 units was placed, but we started with 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in 51 units of lost demand (as orders placed in P1 with L=4 won't arrive until P5). Historical demand data shows samples: 50, 38, 43, 60, 43, and the P1 demand was 51. The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 47.5. Since we are in a 'lost demand' state early on due to zero starting inventory, I need to ensure the base stock calculation covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use L=4 (promised) and use the average demand across all known samples (including P1) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat = 5 * 47.5 = 237.5. Using 'default' methods for mu and sigma will allow the OR engine to use all available history, which is stable.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Feb 25th (Period 3). The SKU is a Men's sweatshirt. Looking at the five pre-game historical samples (Jan 7-Feb 4), mean demand was 46.8. However, recent real-time demand in Period 1 (51) and Period 2 (97) shows a significant upward shift, likely due to seasonal transition or promotion. Period 2's demand spike (97) is more than double the historical average. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 and P2 (61 units each) are in transit (Total 122). No arrivals have occurred yet, which is expected for L=4 (first arrival due in P5 conclude, visible start of P6). I will use recent_N=2 to capture the recent demand surge for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the promised lead time (default) as no evidence yet suggests a deviation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The CURRENT STATUS is Period 4 (2019/3/4). Historical demand for the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' shows a recent increase (97 in Period 2), likely due to seasonal interest in sweatshirt products in early spring. Promised lead time is 4 periods. My oldest order (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at Period 6 start). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts in Periods 1-3. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 250 units (61 from P1, 61 from P2, 128 from P3). To stabilize supply, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation, focusing on the last 5 samples (the historical seed data) which average 46.8 units per period, while noting the high volatility in the game history samples (Avg: 68.6). I'll set L to 'default' as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the base demand level while the OR engine's cap and the pipeline help manage the current backlog.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a sweatshirt (Petar Sweatshirt), which is a staple item. Initial demand samples (50, 38, 43, 60, 43) had a mean of 46.8. Since the game started, we have observed demands of 51, 97, 58, and 44. The spike in Period 2 (97) suggests potential volatility or a response to early spring interest, but recent figures (58, 44) have stabilized. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (61), Period 2 (61), Period 3 (128), and Period 4 (96). According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Pipeline inventory is 346. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture the recent mean (around 60) which is slightly higher than the initial samples, and stick to the default promised lead time of 4 until arrival confirms otherwise.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a sweatshirt. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks: 51, 97, 58, 44, 29 (Mean: 55.8). The demand showed a spike in P2 (97) but has since cooled down significantly as we move further into spring. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and the P1 order arrived exactly on time in P5, confirming L=4. Currently, we have 32 units on hand and 315 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Total pipeline is 347, which covers over 6 weeks of average demand. Given the downward trend in demand (P4: 44, P5: 29) as sweatshirt season likely tapers off in mid-March, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current mean while acknowledging the recent dip. mu_hat is calculated for (1+L) periods. 55.8 * 5 = 279. The pipeline already exceeds this, so the OR backend will likely order a minimum/cap or zero to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a sweatshirt. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has stabilized around an average of 45-50 units per week. Recent demand (P5=29, P6=37) is slightly lower than earlier spikes (P2=97), but the overall mean across all samples (pre-game + P1-P6) is approx 50. Promised lead time is 4 periods, which is confirmed by arrivals in P5 (ordered P1) and P6 (ordered P2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 56. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 280, consisting of orders from P3 (128), P4 (96), P5 (30), and P6 (26). The OR logic uses a base stock policy (L+1 periods). With lead time L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the default method for mu_hat (total mean) and sigma_hat (total std) is appropriate as there isn't yet enough sustained evidence of a regime shift away from the long-term mean of ~50. The high in-transit amount relative to demand suggests the OR backend will likely throttle new orders via the cap mechanism, which is intended.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P5 and P6 arrivals matched P1 and P2 orders).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1st) shows the product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a basics/leisurewear item. Current on-hand inventory is 134 units, with 152 in-transit. Based on 'conclude' messages from Periods 5, 6, and 7, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (matching the promised L=4). Recent demand (Periods 3-7) has been 58, 44, 29, 37, 50, averaging 43.6 units/period. The initial demand spike in P2 (97) appears to be an outlier or early-season phenomenon not sustained in the last 5 weeks. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=5 for demand reflects this stable post-launch phase (approx 218 units needed). With on-hand (134) + pipeline (152) = 286 units, we are currently well-covered. Setting L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed 4-period lead time and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current stable demand regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are forecasting for Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a sweatshirt, which typically sees steady demand in early spring. Historical demand samples (last 5: 29, 37, 50, 44, plus pre-history average ~47) show a stable mean around 41.6 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (observed across periods 5-8). Current on-hand inventory (186) plus in-transit (56) equals 242 units. Given a lead time of 4, our 'pipeline' needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At ~42 units/period, the required base stock is roughly 210 units plus a safety buffer. Since our current total inventory (242) exceeds this expected target, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero or small orders to avoid excess holding costs ($1/unit). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to rely on the observed consistency and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most relevant post-startup consumption patterns.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a basics apparel item. Current date is mid-April (2019/4/15). Historical demand has been relatively stable with an average around 49 units per period across all available data (pre-game and game history). Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P5-P9) has averaged 39.2 units, showing a slight decrease compared to the pre-game samples (avg 46.8). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently high (180 units on-hand) due to previous large orders arriving while demand normalized. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A forecast of ~40 units per period (recent average) results in a base stock requirement of ~200 units. Pipeline inventory (on-hand 180 + in-transit 26) is 206, meaning we are currently well-stocked. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=9 to capture full game history) and sigma_hat to reflect current demand stability and L='default' since lead time is stable at 4.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a sweatshirt, which typically sees peak demand in late winter/early spring and autumn. Historical demand data from early February (Period 1-4) showed a mean of ~62.5 units per week, but since mid-March (Period 5-10), the average demand has dropped to 35.6 units/week, with a notable low of 18 units in Period 10. This suggests we have entered a warmer season (late spring) where sweatshirt demand is declining. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated through Period 10). Pipeline inventory is 83 units (from Period 10) and on-hand is high at 188. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining demand regime, I am using a recent_N (N=6) approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the lower 35.6 units/week average (resulting in a forecasted demand over L+1 periods of ~178 units). This will prevent unnecessary ordering while the existing stock depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 5 (mid-March): average weekly demand decreased from ~63 to ~36 units as spring progressed.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 12 (2019/04/29). The product is a sweatshirt, which is entering a low-demand season (spring/summer). A demand regime shift was noted at Period 11, where demand dropped from an average of ~63 to ~36. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has been even lower: 36, 18, and 22, averaging ~25.3 units/period. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Our current inventory position is high: On-hand (166) + In-transit (83) = 249 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~25, we need ~125 units; at the post-shift mean of ~36, we need ~180 units. Since 249 units already exceed both estimates and holding costs are being incurred ($1/unit), I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand mean (~27) to prevent further over-ordering while the backend OR engine naturally depletes current stock. I will use N=7 for mu_hat to capture the regime since P5, and N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is a 'soft sweatshirt' which is naturally entering a seasonal low as temperatures rise in May. Historical demand analysis confirms a regime shift recorded in Period 11: demand dropped from a mean of ~63 (Periods 1-4) to ~36 (Periods 5-12). Recent demand specifically shows volatility with the last few periods recording 36, 18, 22, and 41. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods. Our current status shows On-hand = 125 and In-transit = 83 (the order from Period 10, which is scheduled to arrive at the end of Period 14). This total inventory of 208 units covers over 5 periods of forecasted demand at the current average (36 * 5 = 180). To prevent excessive holding costs during the seasonal downturn, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the post-shift demand regime (Period 5 onwards).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is a soft sweatshirt, which is seasonally moving out of its peak demand period as late spring/summer approaches. Period 11's carry-over insight identified a demand regime shift starting Period 5 (~March 11), with average demand dropping from ~63 to ~36 units. Since then (Periods 5-13), demand has averaged 34.1 units (29, 37, 50, 44, 36, 18, 22, 41, 30), further confirming the shift. Recent demand (Periods 11-13) is roughly 31 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every fulfilled order (Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). One order from Period 10 (83 units) is expected to arrive in Period 14 (concluded in P15) and an order from Period 13 (6 units) in Period 17 (concluded in P18). Current on-hand (93) and in-transit (89) totals 182 units, which covers over 5 weeks of demand at the current rate (~34 units/week). To avoid overstocking a seasonal item (sweatshirt) during warmer months, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (since the regime shift in Period 5) to reflect the lower sustained demand level and maintain the default lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a 'soft sweatshirt' which has seen a sustained demand decrease as we moved from winter/fresh spring (Feb/Mar) into late spring (May). The demand regime shift noted in Period 11 (dropping from ~63 to ~36 units/week) remains valid. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand has averaged 29.5 units (22, 41, 30, 25). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (153 units) due to the arrival of an 83-unit order from Period 10, which was placed before the demand drop was fully recognized. Pipeline remains at 31 units (orders from P13 and P14). Since (1+L) * \u03bc is approx (5 * 30) = 150, and our total inventory position is 184 (153 on-hand + 31 in-transit), we are currently overstocked. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and lead time to capture the lower post-shift average while maintaining enough sample stability to avoid excessive stockouts as we enter early summer.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a sweatshirt, which typically sees declining demand in warmer months. A demand regime shift was previously identified in Period 11, starting around mid-March (Period 5), where demand dropped from ~63 to ~36 units per week. Analysis of the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) shows an average demand of 31.2 units (22, 41, 30, 25, 38), which is consistent with this lower-demand spring regime. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as seen in arrivals in P14 and P5-P10). Currently, on-hand inventory is 115 and in-transit is 51 (total pipeline = 166). With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At ~31.2 units/period, target base stock is roughly 156. Since pipeline (166) is slightly above this, the OR backend will likely order minimal amounts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to cover the entirety of this lower-demand regime since Period 5 to ensure stable parameters.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd (Period 17). The product is a 'soft sweatshirt' which has shown a demand decrease since the end of March as spring transitioned into summer. Carry-over insights and historical data since Period 10 (mid-April) show demand stabilizing around a mean of ~31 units per week. Lead time is reliably 4 periods based on historical concludes (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, and P14 all show L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 71, with 90 in-transit (orders from P13, P14, P15, P16). The next arrival is expected in Period 17 (from P13). For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 7 (Periods 10 to 16) to capture the current warmer-weather demand regime, which averages ~31.1 units. This results in mu_hat = (1+4)*31.1 = 155.5. For sigma_hat, recent_N of 7 follows the same regime logic. The backend OR logic will compare the pipeline (71 + 90 = 161) against the base stock and likely place a small or zero order to maintain the lower inventory level appropriate for the summer season.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a product likely experiencing lower demand as we move into June June (Date: 2019/6/10). The confirmed demand regime shift since Period 5 shows an average of ~33 units per period (Periods 5-17). Recent demand in the last 5 periods has averaged 31 units, with Period 17 being notably low at 13 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 64, pipeline at 116, and current demand levels, the inventory position is comfortable. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand trend while maintaining a buffer, and N=13 (covering the post-shift period) for sigma_hat to accurately reflect recent volatility without being overly influenced by the initial high-demand period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a 'soft sweatshirt', which naturally sees lower demand during the summer months. Historical demand analysis confirms a regime shift that began around Period 5 (March), where average weekly demand dropped from ~63 to ~36. Recent demand (last 8 periods) has stayed in this lower range, averaging approximately 28.5 units per period with occasional fluctuations (e.g., Period 16: 44, Period 18: 15). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P17 and P18 arrivals both confirmed L=4). Pipeline inventory currently sits at 108 units (ordered in Periods 15, 16, 17, and 18), with arrivals expected in Periods 19, 20, 21, and 22. On-hand inventory is 74. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=8) to capture the current summer demand level while accounting for recent volatility, and default for lead time as it matches the promised value.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 20 (late June). The product is a sweatshrt, which is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as summer progresses. Since the regime shift identified at Period 11, demand has fluctuated significantly. Over the last 6 periods (Periods 14-19), demand has been 25, 38, 44, 13, 15, and 3. The most recent three periods show a very sharp decline (average ~10 units) as we enter the height of summer. The lead time L=4 remains consistent across historical arrivals. Total inventory (on-hand 91 + in-transit 92 = 183) is very high relative to recent demand. Given the seasonal nature of 'soft brushed inside' sweatshirts in late June, I expect demand to remain low. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the lower spring/summer average (~23 units per week) while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock for (1+L)=5 periods. This ensures the cap mechanism prevents over-ordering while we clear the current high inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Entering summer peak (late June), demand dropped from ~35/week to ~10/week (seen in P17-P19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is a soft sweatshirt (brushed inside), which is highly seasonal and inappropriate for the peak summer heat in July. A clear demand regime shift was detected around Period 17 (early June), where demand dropped from an average of ~36 units to ~10. In the most recent four periods (P17-P20), demand has plummeted further: 13, 15, 3, and 1. This confirms that the sweatshirt is out of season. On-hand inventory is currently 129 units, with 53 units in-transit (ordered P17-P19). Given that recent demand is effectively negligible (averaging <8 over the last 4 periods), my existing inventory of 129 + 53 = 182 units is vastly oversupplied for the forecasted lead time demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N=4 to reflect the current summer demand collapse and minimize holding costs while the existing stock is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand collapse confirmed: Period 17-20 demand averaged 8 units/week, with the two most recent weeks showing near-zero demand (3 and 1) due to product seasonality (heavy sweatshirt).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a heavy sweatshirt (PETAR SWEATSHIRT), which is experiencing a significant seasonal demand collapse as we enter July. Historical demand for the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) has dropped to an average of 7.8 units/week (13, 15, 3, 1, 7), with the last three weeks specifically showing very low volume (avg ~3.7). Current inventory (154 on-hand + 21 in-transit) is extremely high relative to this summer demand level, providing over 20 weeks of coverage at current rates. To prevent further accumulation of expensive holding costs, I am forecasting a mean demand of 5 units/week. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*5 = 25 and sigma_hat to a low value reflecting the stable, low-demand summer floor. This will naturally suppress ordering via the base-stock calculation until the excess stock is depleted.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-July (Period 23). The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' with 'soft brushed inside,' which is highly seasonal and typically sees very low demand during summer months. Historically, for this SKU, demand dropped from ~35/week (Spring) to ~10/week or less starting around Period 17 (June). Recent demand (Periods 17-22) has been [13, 15, 3, 1, 7, 19], averaging 9.6 units per week. Although Period 22 saw a slight uptick to 19, the overall summer regime remains low. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently very high (152 units) relative to recent demand, which is sufficient to cover approximately 15 weeks of summer demand. Pipeline inventory is small (4 units). Given the high holding cost ($1/unit/period) and low seasonal demand, the priority is to avoid ordering and burn through existing stock. I will use a recent_N (N=6) of the summer regime for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect the low demand and prevent the OR engine from over-ordering due to the high historical spring averages.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a heavy sweatshirt (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) currently in the peak of summer (July 22). Demand has collapsed significantly as expected for seasonal apparel. Over the last 7 periods (P17-P23), demand has averaged approximately 9 units per week, significantly down from the spring average of ~36. The most recent three periods (P21-P23) show demand of 7, 19, and 10, respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 146 units with 0 in-transit. With a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, the system aims to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~9 units/week, the desired base stock would be around 45-60 units. Since current inventory (146) is nearly triple the expected demand for the next lead time cycle, no new orders should be placed. I am setting L to 4 (consistent with history), and mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the summer demand floor (approx 9 units/week * 5 = 45), which will trigger the OR backend to stop ordering while we bleed off excess inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813005 (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) is currently in a summer demand trough, which is typical for a heavy sweatshirt in late July (Period 25). Demand over the last 6 periods (P19-P24) has averaged 8.16 units/week (3, 1, 7, 19, 10, 9). With an current on-hand inventory of 137 units and zero in-transit, we have enough stock to cover roughly 17 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the holding cost of $1.0/unit/period vs. a profit of $19.0/unit, the OR backend's target service level is high, but the 'cap' mechanism will prevent over-ordering. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8, covering early June to late July) to capture the seasonal decline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a heavy sweatshirt. We are currently in early August (Period 26), which is the tail end of the summer season. Demand from Period 17 to Period 25 (last 9 weeks) has averaged approximately 11.2 units per week, which is a significant drop from spring levels. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 114 units, whereas the expected total demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 56 units based on recent performance. No new orders are needed as current stock extensively covers the seasonal lull and is likely sufficient for the start of the 'back-to-school' or early autumn uptick. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting parameters to reflect the recent low-demand regime to ensure no further orders are triggered by the OR backend.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which has exhibited a significant seasonal decline throughout the summer. Demand has stabilized into a low-volume regime since late June (Period 17 onwards). Over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), demand has averaged 11.7 units per week. The most recent three weeks (P24-P26) show a slight uptick (mean = 16) compared to the deep lows of 1-7 units seen earlier, suggesting we might be leveling out or seeing a very early precursor to late-summer/pre-autumn interest. On-hand inventory is currently 98 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 and an average demand of ~12-16 units/week, we currently hold roughly 6-8 weeks of stock. This is significantly more than needed to cover the (L+1) window (approx 60-80 units required). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period regime (N=10) to reflect the summer demand level, ensuring the base stock calculation aligns with current reality and avoids triggering unnecessary orders.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime stable (P17-P26): average demand 11.7 units/week. Inventory levels remain high relative to current demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are entering late summer/pre-autumn. Period 27 saw a significant demand jump to 48 units, which is the highest since early spring (April). This likely signals the beginning of the end of the summer low-demand regime for this sweatshirt SKU as consumers start preparing for cooler weather. Currently, on-hand inventory is 50 units with 0 in-transit. The 4-period lead time is consistent. While demand averaged ~11.7 during the summer (P17-P26), the sudden jump to 48 is a leading indicator of a regime shift. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P24-P27) to capture this upward movement (average ~24), resulting in a base stock that will trigger a replenishment order to cover the lead time + review period, anticipating further seasonal growth.

Carry-over insight: Early signs of autumn demand recovery: Period 27 demand (48) is 4x the summer average, suggesting the end of the summer low-demand regime as of mid-August.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 29 (late August). The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is highly seasonal. We have clear evidence of an autumn demand recovery: Period 27 demand was 48 units and Period 28 was 35 units, significantly higher than the summer average of approx. 11 units. This aligns with the transition from summer (low demand for sweatshirts) to autumn (increasing demand). As we enter the peak season, demand is expected to return to or exceed the levels seen in Feb-Mar (average ~54). I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect this expected recovery to prevent stockouts as temperatures drop. The lead time L is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (15) with 52 units in-transit (ordered P28, arriving P32). My explicit mu_hat of 250 across the (L+1) window (equivalent to 50 units/week) ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock that accounts for this seasonal upswing.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Period 27-28 demand averaged 41.5 units, returning to pre-summer levels (approx 4x summer average).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is highly seasonal. We are now in early September (2019/9/2), entering the peak autumn/winter season. Historical demand in the last 3 periods (P27-P29: 48, 35, 22) confirms a recovery from the summer low, averaging 35 units/week. Note that Period 29 ended with 0 inventory and 7 lost sales (demand 22, sold 15), indicating we are currently under-stocked for the returning demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we are entering the peak season for sweaters, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the autumn recovery trend, while keeping L at the promised 4 to ensure the pipeline covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use explicit sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed during seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak season entry confirmed: Demand tripled from summer lows (avg ~35 vs ~11). Stockouts occurred in Period 29 due to rapid demand recovery.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a significant autumn/winter demand recovery for the PETAR sweatshirt. Current demand (Period 30: 76 units) has surged, resulting in a stockout (on-hand = 0). History shows a 4-period lead time. We have orders placed in Periods 28 (52 units), 29 (76 units), and 30 (58 units) currently in-transit. The first recovery shipment (from P28) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 32. Since we are currently at zero stock and demand is roughly triple the summer average, we must stabilize mu_hat and sigma_hat around the new regime. Using the most recent 4 periods (P27-P30) captures the recovery trajectory (avg ~45.25), which reflects the transition from summer into peak sweatshirt season (September/October). This ensures the OR engine's 'base stock' calculation targets enough inventory to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) has entered its peak autumn/winter season. Demand has surged since Period 27/28, averaging ~48 units over the last 5 periods (48, 35, 22, 76, 60). We are currently experiencing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory, as orders placed during the summer lull (Periods 28-31) have not yet arrived. Following the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the first significant order (52 units from P28) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 32 (visible at the start of Period 33). Pipeline inventory is high (270 units) which covers expected demand over the lead time, but we must maintain mu_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the seasonal shift (avg ~48), and I will use the same N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-demand regime confirmed: Average demand Periods 27-31 is 48.2 units/week, a 4x increase from summer lows.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is currently entering its peak autumn/winter season (late September). Demand has transitioned from a summer average of ~11 units to an autumn average of ~48 units per week (Period 27-32). Recent demand is 48 units, following a peak of 76 and 60. We experienced significant stockouts in Periods 29-31 because the supply chain (lead time 4) could not react fast enough to the sudden late-August recovery. High demand is expected to sustain or increase as we move into October and November. In-transit inventory is high (267), but much of this (orders from P29, P30, P31) is still arriving over the next 3 weeks. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time remains stable. mu_hat and sigma_hat are based on recent_N=6 (Periods 27-32) to capture this high-demand regime specifically while excluding the summer slump.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Autumn/Winter peak season for SKU 685813005 (soft sweatshirt fabric). Demand has surged significantly; the last week (Period 33) saw a massive spike to 138 units, while the previous four weeks averaged roughly 60 units. This indicates a high-intensity demand phase. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent deliveries (P32 and P33). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 231 units in-transit (ordered in P30-P33). Given the stockouts in P30, P31, and P33, we need to aggressively cover this high-demand regime. Using recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat (covering the start of the recovery in P27) would result in a mean of (48+35+22+76+60+48+138)/7 = 61 units. To better capture the immediate momentum of the winter peak and the P33 jump, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on an expected weekly demand of ~85 units (balancing the 138 spike with the 60 average) across the 5-period horizon (L+1). This results in 85 * 5 = 425. For sigma_hat, I will use explicit values to account for the high volatility (138 vs 48 in the last two weeks).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Peak winter demand intensification. Period 33 demand (138) is double the previous 4-week average (60), indicating extreme seasonality/volatility for sweatshirts in late September.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak winter demand season for sweatshirts (October). Demand has intensified significantly, with the last two periods showing 138 and 102 units respectively. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), we must maintain a high service level. Demand in the 'Autumn/Winter' regime (since Period 27) has averaged approximately 76 units/week, but the last 3 weeks averaged 100 units/week. To account for the recent acceleration and high volatility (sigma), I will use the last 8 samples (since the regime shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak autumn/winter demand regime (mid-October) for sweatshirts. Demand has surged and remains high, with the most recent three periods (P33-P35) showing demand of 138, 102, and 98 units (average ~113). The current on-hand inventory is 0 due to persistent stockouts as demand outpaced our previous projections. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand window, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime. Using recent_N=5 captures the jump starting at P31. This results in a mu_hat of approx 545 (5 units * ~109 avg demand) and a corresponding sigma_hat to handle the increased volatility seen in P33.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high-winter levels: Period 33-35 average demand is 112.7 units/week, up from the early autumn average of ~48.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak winter demand regime for sweatshirts (late October). Demand over the last four periods (P33-P36) has been consistently high: 138, 102, 98, and 73, averaging approximately 103 units/week. However, the system is currently stock-out constrained, with on-hand inventory at 0 and sales limited by arrivals. Looking at the demand trend, there is a slight deceleration from the extreme peak of P33, but demand remains significantly higher than the early autumn average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this stabilized high-winter demand (approx 103 * 5 = 515). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the high volatility observed during this seasonal ramp-up. Pipeline inventory is high (470), but given the 5-period outlook (L+1), we need to maintain a high base stock to recover from the current stock-out state and meet upcoming November demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) is in its peak winter demand regime (late October). On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to sustained demand exceeding recent arrivals. I have 573 units in transit, with 152 units (ordered Period 34) expected to arrive during this period (Period 38) to finally quench the stockout. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Period 33, demand has stabilized at a high level. Demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) was: 138, 102, 98, 73, 106. Average demand over these 5 periods is 103.4 units/week. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand winter regime while ignoring earlier low-demand autumn/summer data. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, approximately 517 units. With 573 in the pipeline, the OR engine will likely order a smaller amount to maintain the buffer against the current high volatility (sigma).

Carry-over insight: Winter peak regime stable (P33-P37): demand averaging 103.4 units/week with high volatility (std dev ~23). Stockouts persist due to lagging pipeline, but replenishment of 152 units is expected P38.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/4. We are firmly in the winter high-demand regime for sweatshirts. Since Period 33, demand has averaged 103 units per week (P33-P38: 138, 102, 98, 73, 106, 102). In Period 38, we finally received a large shipment of 152 units (ordered in P34), which helped cover the 102 units of demand and left 50 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is currently heavy (451 units in-transit) following large orders placed between P35 and P37. Given the stable high demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the current winter average (approx 103/week * 5 weeks = 515). This ensures we maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus review period without over-ordering unnecessarily now that the pipeline is full.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for the sweatshirt SKU has stabilized in a high-demand winter regime. Since Period 33, demand has averaged approximately 102 units/week with a standard deviation of roughly 19.3. We are currently in mid-November, where demand for this category is expected to remain high due to seasonal cold weather and upcoming holiday shopping periods. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 38 and 39 matching orders from Periods 34 and 35. Total inventory position (On-hand 86 + In-transit 414 = 500) is slightly below the estimated demand for the lead-time plus review period (102 * 5 = 510). I will use the last 7 periods (P33-P39) as the sample for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this stabilized peak regime while providing enough volatility coverage for the observed fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak regime remains stable into mid-November; Period 33-39 average demand is 101.7 units/week (std dev 19.3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1245.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Petar Sweatshirt) is currently in its peak winter demand phase. As of Period 41 (mid-November), demand has stabilized at a high level. Since the regime shift in Period 33, demand has averaged approximately 101.7 units per week with a standard deviation of 19.3. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 161, In-transit: 345) are healthy, with arrivals from orders placed in Period 37 (143 units) expected to arrive during the current period (Period 41 Resolution). To maintain this service level through the end of the year, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting, selecting N=8 to capture the stable winter regime (Periods 33-40). This ensures \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 reflect the current high-demand environment while ignoring the lower autumn/summer data. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if the pipeline (506 units including on-hand) is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a sweatshirt (SKU 685813005) currently in its peak winter demand period (late November). Demand has stabilized at a high level since Period 33, with the most recent regime (P33-P41) showing an average demand of 99.1 units/week and a standard deviation of 19.3. On-hand inventory is healthy at 218 units, following the arrival of a large order (143 units) from Period 37. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) and the stable but volatile nature of late-season peak demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 9 periods (the stabilized winter regime) to maintain an appropriate base stock. This ensures we cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) while accounting for the ~20% volatility observed in this segment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4712.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked dramatically to 299 units, far exceeding the recent average of ~100. This is likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales, a critical peak for sweatshirts. On-hand inventory is now 0. We have 309 units in-transit, with 92 units from Period 39 expected to arrive during Period 43. Given the 299 units demand last period, the pipeline is under pressure if this high demand persists into December. I will increase the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent window that includes the spike, but I'll use 'recent_N' with N=10 to balance the extreme outlier with previous weeks, preventing over-ordering just as the peak might subside while still ensuring some protection. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Extreme demand spike (299 units) observed, likely corresponding to Black Friday / Cyber Monday. This is 3x the previous winter average.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Period 42 saw a massive spike of 299 units, while Period 43 cooled down to 75 units. This suggests the extreme peak has passed, but we remain in the winter high-demand regime. The carry-over insights indicate a winter average of approximately 100-110 units/week prior to the outlier. To set mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=11 (covering Periods 33-43, encompassing the winter regime and the surge) to capture the high seasonal mean while smoothing the recent outlier. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=11 to reflect the significantly increased volatility (ranging from 73 to 299). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical conclusions. On-hand inventory is low (17), while pipeline inventory is high (444), which should cover upcoming weeks as we approach the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday demand cooling observed (Period 43 demand 75 vs Period 42 spike of 299). Winter regime overall remains high compared to autumn levels.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019/12/16). Demand remains high following the extreme Black Friday/Cyber Monday spike in Period 42. Period 44 demand (106) and the high 'sold' count (97) confirm that demand is back to the winter baseline of ~100 units/week after the briefly observed post-spike cooling. Starting on-hand is 0, but massive orders (227 units in P43 and 220 units in P44) are in the pipeline to address the stockout and the spike. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the stable winter regime (excluding the outlier spike of 299). Using a 7-period window (P38-P44, excluding P42) gives an average demand of 90, which is a safer winter estimate than including the outlier. Given the stockout in P44, a higher sigma_hat is used (recent_N=10) to capture the volatility of this peak season and ensure sufficient safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak baseline confirmed: excluding the P42 Black Friday spike, demand from P38-P44 averages ~93 units/week, maintaining the high-demand regime established in October.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), placing us at the peak of winter sweatshirt demand and entering the post-holiday clearance phase. Demand has remained strong (121 in P45), though volatile. Following the Black Friday anomaly in P42, demand has stabilized at a high-winter level. The winter baseline (excluding the P42 spike) is approximately 93-100 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory currently at 0 and a significant pipeline (662 units), we must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 weeks of peak demand while accounting for potential post-holiday cooling. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture the high-winter regime while smoothing the P42 spike, and recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect current holiday-related volatility. Lead time remains 'default' at the promised 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are in the deep winter regime for sweatshirts. Excluding the Black Friday spike in Period 42, recent demand (P43-P46) has been consistently robust: 75, 106, 121, 74, averaging approximately 94 units/week. This aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 45 designating a high-demand baseline of ~93 units. Lead times have remained perfectly stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to maintain a high base stock to cover the current 4-period lead time plus the review period (1 week), totaling 5 weeks of demand. With demand centering around 94 units, mu_hat should target ~470 units. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand regime since mid-November, effectively smoothing the Black Friday anomaly while capturing current winter volatility. The backend's capping mechanism and our significant pipeline (795 units) will manage the actual order quantity to prevent overstocking as we exit the holiday peak.
