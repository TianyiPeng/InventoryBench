Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Fake leather Leggings', a fashion item that likely sees steady demand post-holiday or potentially a slight peak leading into spring. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 70 units/week (83, 62, 67, 81, 57). Since this is the initial period with no established regime shift yet, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent demand average (approx 70). For lead time, I will use 'default' (4) until actual arrivals provide evidence for adjustment. mu_hat is calculated as (1+L)*mean, where 1+L=5. For 5 samples, mean=70, so expected mu_hat is 350. The OR backend will handle the base stock calculation using these parameters.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Fake 1p Leggings', a women's fashion item. Looking at the historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4), demand was relatively stable (avg \u2248 70). Period 1 actual demand was 50, but we had 0 sales due to 0 starting inventory. Orders were placed in Period 1 (89 units) and are currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 4. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and the first order won't arrive until Period 5 (Period 1 + 4), we must ensure the supply pipeline is robust. The demand samples show: 83, 62, 67, 81, 57, and 50. Total samples: 6. Mean demand is approx 66. With L=4, mu_hat should target (1+4) * 66 = 330. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the recent stable demand trend.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is 'Fake 1p Leggings'. Currently Period 3, looking at historical demand from Jan/Feb. Historical mean demand is approximately 70 units/week. Current inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, demand is being lost. Order placed in P1 (89 units) and P2 (89 units) are in-transit. Promised lead time is 4. Given the lead time, the P1 order should arrive in Period 5 (L=4). Demand is relatively stable (83, 62, 67, 81, 57, 50, 83). The mean of all 7 samples is 69 units. I will use the default lead time (4) and the mean of all samples to project requirements.mu_hat should cover (L+1) = 5 periods. 69 * 5 = 345. Since we have 0 on-hand and 178 in transit, the OR engine needs parameters to bridge to the target base stock. Setting L to 4, mu_hat to 345, and sigma_hat using all samples to capture the historical volatility (std dev approx 12.8, so sqrt(5)*12.8 approx 28.6).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Women's imitation leather leggings. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~70 units. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3) is 50, 83, 70 (average 67.6), showing consistency with the prior. Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders from P1, P2, and P3 are in-transit (total 270 units). According to the lead time definition, an order placed in P1 with L=4 arrives during P5 and is visible in the P5 conclude message (ready for use in P6). Therefore, zero arrivals to date is expected behavior. Current on-hand is 0, leading to lost sales, but this is unavoidable due to the initial lead time gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture the most recent realized demand pattern while setting L to default (4). The OR backend's base_stock logic will calculate the order needed to cover the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is Women's Leggings (Imitation Leather). Historical demand samples provide a mean of ~70 units/week. Recent observed demand in Periods 1-4 is [50, 83, 70, 61], with a mean of 66. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase (visible in Period 5 conclude). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because of the lead time delay. Total in-transit is 366 units (89+89+92+96). I will use L=4 (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 (5 historical + 4 current periods) to capture the stable demand pattern while accounting for the full lead time protection (L+1=5 periods of demand).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Fake Leggings' (Womens Nightwear, Socks & Tights). Current inventory is 23 on-hand with 277 in-transit. Historical demand shows a stable range (50-83) with no clear seasonal trend yet. The first order from Period 1 (89 units) arrived in Period 5 conclude, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Demand samples are P-4: 83, P-3: 62, P-2: 67, P-1: 81, P0: 57, P1: 50, P2: 83, P3: 70, P4: 61, P5: 66. The average demand over these 10 samples is 68 units. Since the lead time is confirmed as 4, and the pipeline (277) is already covering roughly 4 periods of average demand (4 * 68 = 272), I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' for Mu/Sigma using N=10 to capture the full recent history of this stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is 'Fake imitation leather leggings'. Demand history shows a stable range between 50-83 units, with a mean of ~66.7 over the last 6 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrival of Period 1 and Period 2 orders exactly at the start of Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Current on-hand is 61, with 250 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Given the consistent lead time, I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (N=6 from game history + seed data) as no significant regime shift is detected yet. The parameters aim to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at a ~80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is 'imitation leather leggings'. Seasonal analysis suggests that demand for this type of fashion item typically softens as we move from cold winter months into spring. Looking at the demand history: P1-P4 (pre-inventory) recorded demand was [50, 83, 70, 61], and P5-P7 (since we had stock) recorded demand was [66, 51, 39]. There is a clear downward trend in the last few periods (66 -> 51 -> 39). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from P1, P2, and P3 have confirmed the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. My pipeline inventory is currently 188 units (orders from P4, P6, P7; note P5 was 0), and I have 114 units on-hand. Given the declining trend, I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and the downward trend. This will set a lower base stock to avoid excessive holding costs as spring progresses, while still covering the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean demand decreasing from ~65 (P1-P5) to ~45 (P6-P7) as spring begins. Actual lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is 'Fake 1p Leggings', likely imitation leather. Demand has shown a clear downward shift as we move further into spring. The initial mean (P1-P5) was approx 66, while the recent mean (P6-P8) is approx 45.7 (51, 39, 47). Currently, we have 163 units on-hand and 92 in-transit (from P6 and P7 orders), totaling 255 units. With a lead time (L) of 4, our base stock targets (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current demand rate (~46/week), 5 periods requires ~230 units. We already have 255. Therefore, the OR backend likely won't place a new order this period, which is appropriate given the seasonal decline. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current lower demand regime and use the promised lead time (L=4) which is consistent with actual observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~65 to ~46 starting Period 6 (corresponds with spring seasonality for imitation leather leggings).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter Period 10 (April 15), the demand for 'Leggings in imitation leather' is showing a clear seasonal decline typical of the transition into late spring. Historical data showed a mean of ~66 units/week in late winter (P1-P5), but this has dropped significantly to a mean of 45.5 units/week over the last 4 periods (P6-P9: 51, 39, 47, 45). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P4 all showing exactly 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 118 units, and we have 92 units in-transit (orders from P6 and P7). With the lower demand regime and high existing inventory plus pipeline, we want to set parameters that prevent overstocking of this seasonal item. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level (~46 units/week) across the lead time + review period (L+1=5). Sigma will also be set based on this recent regime to reflect the current stability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/04/22). The lead time is stable at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand regime for 'Leggings in imitation leather' has clearly shifted downwards as we move further into spring (historically ~70-80 in Feb, now ~30-45 in April). The most recent demand (P10) was 29, and the average since the regime shift at P6 is approximately 42.2 units (51, 39, 47, 45, 29). I will use recent_N=5 to capture this lower late-spring demand profile. With on-hand inventory at 151 and 57 in-transit (total 208), and a projected demand of ~42/period, our current stock covers nearly 5 periods (42 * 5 = 210). The OR backend's capped policy will manage the order size based on this 5-period horizon. I am choosing N=5 for both mean and volatility to reflect the current lower demand and reduced variance.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we move into late April (Period 12), demand for 'imitation leather leggings' continues to decline due to warmer weather. The last three periods (P9-P11) show demands of 45, 29, and 22 units, suggesting the previously identified 'low demand regime' (~45) is softening even further toward a seasonal tail. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P10 and P11 arrivals synchronized perfectly with orders from P6 and P7). Current on-hand inventory is 159 units, which is high (representing ~5-7 weeks of supply at current rates), especially with 47 units still in transit from Period 10 and 11 orders (27+20). I will use recent_N=6 to capture the declining trend in mu_hat while accounting for the lower volatility observed since P6. Given the excess inventory, the OR backend's capped policy will likely restrict further ordering to avoid excessive holding costs as the product enters its off-season.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand decay: Period 10-11 show demand dropping further (29, 22) below the previous ~45 average as spring progresses into summer.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'imitation leather leggings', which is highly seasonal and associated with colder weather. Current date is May 6th. Demand has clearly shifted into a lower regime as spring progresses into summer. Average demand for the first 5 periods was ~65. For periods 6-9, it dropped to ~45. Over the most recent 3 periods (P10-P12), it has dropped further to an average of ~26 (29, 22, 29). This suggests the season for this item is winding down. We currently have 130 units on-hand and 57 in-transit (orders from P10, P11, and P12 totaling 57). Total inventory (187) is very high relative to the current demand rate (~26/week). The OR backend uses a Base Stock policy: (1+L)*mu + z*sigma. To minimize further holding costs while demand is low, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the most recent demand level (~27 per week) and use a recent window for sigma to reflect reduced volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal decay confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~27 units/period over P10-P12 (down from previous ~45 and ~65 regimes).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (May 13, 2019). The product is imitation leather leggings, which are seasonally sensitive to warmer weather. Historical demand shows a clear downward trend: ~65 (P1-P5), then ~45 (P6-P9), and most recently ~28 (P10-P13). This aligns with spring/summer seasonality where demand for heavy leggings significantly decreases. On-hand inventory is 98 and Pipeline is 57. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand regime (~28 units/period), and a holding cost of $1.0 vs $4.0 profit, we risk overstocking. I will set L to 4 (promised) and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent summer-stabilized demand regime (P10: 29, P11: 22, P12: 29, P13: 32). This should prevent unnecessary ordering while maintaining a buffer for the current low-demand period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'imitation leather leggings', which is highly seasonal and experiences a decline in demand during late spring and summer (May/June). Current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand has shifted from an average of ~65 (P1-P5) to ~45 (P6-P9) and currently sits consistently between 22-35 units over the last 5 periods (P10-P14). The mean demand for the most recent 5 periods is 29.4 units. On-hand inventory is 90 units, which is roughly 3 periods of supply at the current rate. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the seasonal downward trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this lower 'summer' regime and avoid excess inventory accumulation during the off-season. Lead time (L) remains at the default (promised 4) as arrivals are consistent.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is 'imitation leather leggings', which is seasonally declining as summer approaches. Recent demand (P12-P15) shows a stabilization around a mean of 32.5 units (29, 32, 35, 34). This is slightly higher than the previous trough but significantly lower than the winter peaks (~65) and early spring (~45). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 76, which is more than two periods of current demand. In-transit inventory is 47 (from P12: 10 units, and P15: 37 units). Total pipeline + on-hand is 123. Given the Lead Time (L=4), the period of coverage should be L+1 = 5 periods. 5 periods * 32.5 = 162.5. Currently, we have 123 units, suggesting we are still slightly under-stocked for a service level target, though the high holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) means the OR backend will naturally lean towards lower inventory. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this recent stabilization at ~33 units per period. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it is highly consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a summer mean of ~33 units/period (P12-15) after the initial spring decay.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (imitation leather leggings) has moved into a summer low-demand phase. Demand has stabilized over the last five periods (P12-P16) with an average of approximately 34.6 units per period (29, 32, 35, 34, 43), up slightly from the previous valley of ~27. On-hand inventory is 43 units, and there is a total pipeline inventory of 74 units (orders from P15 and P16). Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, no arrivals are expected in Period 17 (since no orders were placed in P13). However, the orders from P15 and P16 are expected to arrive in P19 and P20 respectively. To maintain the inventory through the lead time (L=4) plus current period (Total 5 periods of demand), we need approximately 173 units (34.6 * 5). Current total position is 117 (43 on-hand + 74 in-transit), suggesting a need to replenish. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stabilized 'summer' demand profile. Lead time is stable at 4.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Fake 1p Leggings' (imitation leather) is in a summer seasonal trough. Current date is mid-June (2019-06-10). Recent demand history (P13-P17) shows values of 32, 35, 34, 43, 23, with a mean of 33.4. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 20, and in-transit is 118 (total pipeline: 138), which covers roughly 4 periods of demand at the current rate. I will maintain the current mu_hat estimate based on the last 5 periods (regime stabilized at ~33.4 units/period) to avoid over-ordering during the low season. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat accounts for the current summer stability while remaining responsive to potential late-June volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), we are in a summer seasonal low for imitation leather leggings. Demand over the last 3 periods has dropped from the previous Summer mean (~33) to a lower level (23, 17, and a historical seed value suggests this trend may continue). I am selecting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent downward trend (P15-P18 demand averages ~29, with the last two being significantly lower). On-hand inventory is very low (3 units), but we have 161 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been extremely consistent (all arrived orders P5-P16 followed L=4). Although no units arrived in P17 and P18, this matches the 'ordered=0' periods of P13 and P14. We expect the P15 order (37 units) to arrive during P19 (visible in P20 conclude). Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the OR backend uses the stable historical average of 4.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal demand softening: Mean demand decreased to ~20 units/period (P17-P18) from the previous summer mean of ~33.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (June 24, 2019), we are in deep summer seasonality for 'fake leather leggings', which is traditionally a cool-weather product. Demand has significantly decreased and stabilized at a lower level. Over the last three periods (P17-P19), demand has been 23, 17, and 18, averaging approximately 19.3 units per period. This confirms the seasonal softening noted in the Period 19 carry-over insight. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P15 order arrived in P19). With 22 units on-hand and 129 units in-transit (orders from P16, P17, P18, P19), we are well-covered for the current demand regime. Specifically, the pipeline inventory (129) plus on-hand (22) equals 151 units, which covers about 7-8 periods of demand at the current rate of ~20/period, whereas the (L+1) target for L=4 is only 5 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this new local low-demand regime and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor reached: Mean demand confirmed at ~19 units/period over P17-P19 (down ~40% from previous summer mean of ~33).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the demand for 'Leggings in imitation leather' has reached its summer floor. The mean demand over the last four periods (P17-P20) is approximately 17.25 units/period (23, 17, 18, 11), confirming the seasonal decay predicted in earlier carries. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on arrivals in P19 and P20. On-hand inventory is 48 units, and the pipeline is healthy at 92 units (orders from P17, P18, P19). With a total inventory position of 140 units and a mean demand around 17-18, we have roughly 8 periods of coverage, which is significantly higher than the L+1 (5 period) safety target. The OR backend will likely minimize ordering to burn off this excess stock. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this 'summer floor' regime while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the recent variability.

Demand has stabilized at a low 'floor' regime since Period 17, with an average of 17.6 units over the last 5 periods (P17-P21 demand: 23, 17, 18, 11, 19). Although Period 20 was exceptionally low, Period 21 returned to ~19. I will set N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent summer regime (approx. 18-20 units/period). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 17 order in Period 21. With on-hand inventory at 73 and in-transit at 48 (total 121), which covers over 6 periods of demand at the current rate (121 / 18 \u2248 6.7), the OR backend will continue to throttle new orders to minimize holding costs while the excess inventory is depleted throughout the remainder of the summer season.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-15. The product is imitation leather leggings, which is a cold-weather fashion item. As expected, demand has reached a summer floor. Recent demand (P20-P22) has been 11, 19, and 16 units, averaging approximately 15.3 units/period, which is even lower than the previous regime of ~19 noted in Period 20. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 100 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 6 periods. With 5 units in-transit (from P19), the pipeline total of 105 is significantly higher than the base stock needed for a lead-time of 4 (5 periods total coverage). I will set mu_hat to reflect this new floor of ~15 units/period using the last 3 periods (P20-P22) to avoid over-ordering during the summer trough. The OR backend will naturally suppress ordering given the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed: Mean demand decreased to ~15 units/period (P20-P22) from the previous summer mean of ~19 (down ~20%).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (imitation leather leggings) is in a deep summer trough, with demand dropping significantly from earlier periods. Current mean demand over the last 4 periods (P20-P23) is approximately 13.75 units (11, 19, 16, 9), confirming the downward trend noted in the Period 23 carry-over insight. Given the high on-hand inventory (96 units) relative to this low demand (covering ~7 weeks), no new orders are necessary. The pipeline is currently empty (In-transit: 0). I am setting L to 4 as established by historical consistency. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent local demand trough (approx 14 units/period), resulting in a base stock level calculation that will prevent unnecessary ordering while we burn through existing stock. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the decreased volatility accompanying the lower volume.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (imitation leather leggings) is in a deep seasonal trough during late July. Demand has consistently declined from a spring high (~65) to a summer low. The most recent demand regime (P20-P24) shows an average of ~10.4 units per period (11, 19, 16, 9, 7). Current on-hand inventory is 89 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers over 8 periods of supply. With a lead time of 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked. The OR backend will likely calculate a base stock level lower than our current inventory + pipeline (89 + 0), resulting in zero orders being placed, which is appropriate for minimizing holding costs while demand is at its seasonal minimum. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent trough, and stick with the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough deepening: Mean demand for P20-P24 further decreased to ~10 units/period (compared to ~15 in P20-P22).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Leggings in imitation leather', which is highly seasonal and currently in a summer demand trough (Date: 2019/8/5). Recent demand (Period 21-25) has dropped drastically: 19, 16, 9, 7, 4. The average demand for the last 3 periods is 6.6 units, while the last 5 periods average 9 units. On-hand inventory is currently 85 units. With lead time (L) confirmed at 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the recent_N (N=5) method for mu_hat would estimate total demand for 5 periods as (1+4) * 9 = 45 units. Since we have 85 units on-hand and zero in-transit, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand trends. No new orders should be placed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent sharp decline while maintaining the confirmed lead time L=4.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough floor confirmed: demand falling below 10 units/period (P23-P25 average ~6.7) as summer peak temperatures occur in August.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for 'imitation leather leggings' is at its seasonal trough, as expected during peak summer. Recent demand samples (P24-P26) are 7, 4, and 16, averaging ~9 units/period. On-hand inventory is 69 units, which is significantly high given this low demand regime (~7.6 periods of supply). With a 4-period lead time, we must continue to avoid ordering until the high inventory is depleted or demand exhibits a clear upward trend for autumn. I am setting L to 4 (the consistently observed lead time) and mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current trough (~9 units/period * 5 = 45). However, because on-hand inventory (69) plus in-transit (0) exceeds any reasonable base stock for this regime, the OR backend will correctly result in zero orders. Holding cost is high ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0), so lean inventory is prioritized.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical data for this SKU (imitation leather leggings) confirms a major seasonal trough during July and early August (Periods 23-25), with demand dropping as low as 4 units. However, recent demand in Periods 26 (16 units) and 27 (27 units) indicates a significant upward shift as the market transitions from late summer into early autumn. This aligns with seasonal expectations for imitation leather, which typically sees renewed interest as temperatures begin to cool. The mean demand for the last two periods is 21.5. Given the clear inflection point, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this rising trend while tempering the sudden spike of 27 to avoid excessive holding costs on a still-recovering item. On-hand inventory is 42 units with nothing in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using N=3 (averaging 16, 27, and the 4 from P25) helps buffer the transition. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the heightened volatility during this seasonal shift.

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn demand recovery detected: Demand increased from a trough of ~6.7 units (P23-P25) to an average of 21.5 units (P26-P27), signaling the end of the summer low for imitation leather products.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) is exiting its summer trough and entering a recovery phase as autumn approaches. We observed a significant demand jump starting around P26 (16 units), P27 (27 units), and P28 (22 units), averaging approximately 21.7 units/period over the last 3 periods. This is a sharp increase from the summer low of ~6.7 units. As we move into late August and September, the cooler weather typically drives demand for these products back toward the spring mean (~45 units) and eventually the winter mean (~65 units). At Period 29, the pipeline (35 units) and on-hand (20 units) total 55 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand through Period 33. To prevent stockouts during this recovery, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (average ~22) and increase sigma_hat to account for high volatility during a phase shift. L is set to calculate as the lead time has been a consistent 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Demand shifted from a summer trough of ~7 units (P23-P25) to a mean of ~22 units (P26-P28) as of late August.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Fake 1p Leggings' (imitation leather), which shows strong seasonality. Demand reached a summer trough (approx. 7 units/period) in July/August and is now recovering as autumn approaches. In Period 28-29, we moved into late August/early September, where demand typically rises for this product category. While Period 29 demand (15) was lower than Period 27-28 (27, 22), the 4-period moving average (P26-P29) is approx. 20 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are ordering for the late September/early October window, where demand is historically higher (confirmed by the starting history samples P1-P4 which averaged ~65-70 units in February). I will set L to 'calculate' (steady at 4 periods). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the early autumn recovery (average ~20 units/period) which results in a base stock level covering (1+4)*20 = 100 units. This approach balances the risk of rapid seasonal growth against current on-hand/in-transit inventory (5 on-hand + 68 in-transit).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fake Leggings' (imitation leather), which exhibits a strong seasonal demand recovery as we transition from summer to autumn. Demand in Period 30 reached 39 units, confirming the autumn recovery previously detected. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and awaiting arrivals from orders placed starting in Period 28. A lead time of 4 periods remains consistent. Given the current period is 31 and the orders from P28 are due in P32 (visible in P33), we must bridge the coverage gap for the next 4-5 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the upward trend since mid-August (P26-P30 mean approx 24), which provides a base_stock target intended to cover the accelerating autumn demand while accounting for the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery acceleration: Demand reached 39 units in Period 30, confirming a significant trend upward from the summer trough (previously ~7 units) as temperatures drop in September.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) is clearly exiting its summer trough and entering a strong autumn recovery. Current demand is spiking: Period 30 (39 units) and Period 31 (46 units) show a significant upward trajectory compared to the summer mean of ~7. As of Period 32 (Sept 16), date-based reasoning suggests demand will continue to rise as cooler autumn weather increases interest in faux leather products. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 31, and we have a pipeline of 138 units. While the promised lead time is 4 periods, we are currently waiting for several orders placed in late August/early September (Periods 28-31) to arrive. According to the 4-period lead time, the order from P28 should arrive during the current Period 32, becoming visible in Period 33. To address the sharp demand increase and prevent further stockouts, I am increasing mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the shift from ~15 to over 40 units while using an explicit L of 4 to match the confirmed physical lead time behavior.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Demand accelerated from ~22 (P26-P28) to ~42.5 (P30-P31) as of mid-September, reflecting high seasonal sensitivity for imitation leather products.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (imitation leather leggings) is currently in a strong Autumn recovery phase as temperatures cool in September. Recent demand (P30-P32) has been 39, 46, and 51 units, showing a clear upward trend. The mean demand for the last 3 periods is ~45 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are currently stock-out (ending inventory 0) and have 145 units in transit (expected arrivals in P33, P34, P35, P36), we need to set parameters that recognize this surge to avoid further lost sales. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (N=3 reflects the most recent 45+ demand regime) and sigma_hat to capture the high volatility during this ramp-up. L remains at the default/calculated 4.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge has reached a new regime: Mean demand for P30-P32 is ~45 units (up from ~22 in P26-P28), reflecting strong seasonal growth for imitation leather products in September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) is experiencing a massive autumn demand surge as expected for this product category in September/October. Period 33 saw demand explode to 119 units, far exceeding the recent mean of ~45. This looks like a peak seasonal spike. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 168 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp non-linear increase (from 46 to 51 to 119), I am shifting mu_hat to an explicit forecast to prevent the OR backend from severely under-ordering during this critical window. I estimate a mean demand of 90 units per period for the next 5 periods (Review + Lead time) to capture the peak while acknowledging Period 33 might be an outlier spike. I will use a high N for sigma_hat to account for this massive volatility. Parameters are set to ensure the OR backend attempts to pull in enough stock to cover the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand surge: Demand spiked to 119 units in Period 33 (Date: 2019/9/23), confirming a high-intensity seasonal peak for imitation leather products in late September/October. This follows the previously detected autumn recovery.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'fake leather leggings' has transitioned from a summer trough (~7 units) to a significant autumn surge. Period 33 peaked at 119 units and Period 34 recorded 78 units, indicating a volatile but high-demand regime as October begins (Halloween and cooler weather seasonality). The average demand for the last five periods (P30-P34) is approximately 66.6 units, but the last two periods averaged 98.5 units. Given the inventory stockouts (on-hand is 0) and the high seasonality of the product, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this upward shift while avoiding over-reliance on the single 119-unit spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The large order in Period 34 (154 units) is in-transit, but we must continue to signal high demand to ensure the base stock levels are maintained during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime confirmed: Demand for P33-P34 (avg 98.5) shows a significant spike from the P30-P32 average (avg 45). Late Sept/Early Oct is a peak period for this product category.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (imitation leather leggings) is in its peak autumn seasonal regime. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 119 and has remained high in Periods 34-35 (78 and 84 units respectively). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have been stocking out because previous orders were based on lower demand estimates. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With a 4-period lead time, we must cover 5 periods of demand (review + lead time). Using the average of the last 3 periods (P33-P35: (119+78+84)/3 = 93.7), the expected total demand for the next 5 periods is approximately 468.5 units. The current pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 355 units. Setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 3 periods captures the current peak regime. Given the high stock-out risk and high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I am maintaining a responsive sigma_hat to ensure high service levels during this narrow retail window.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-October period, which is the peak season for imitation leather leggings as temperatures cool. Historical demand for the last four periods (P33-P36) has been consistently high (119, 78, 84, 57), averaging approximately 84.5 units per period. Despite observing a slight softening to 57 units in P36, the overall autumn peak regime remains the primary driver. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts (sold < demand) for the last 7 consecutive periods because past orders were based on lower summer/early-autumn demand. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since we have 444 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed in P33-P36), we must maintain a high mu_hat to ensure the OR backend's base-stock level accounts for this sustained peak demand while also being mindful of the 'cap' logic. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this autumn peak (P33-P36). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to capture the high volatility seen during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau: Demand for P33-P36 averaged ~84.5 units, confirming a high-intensity seasonal regime for imitation leather leggings through mid-October.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Leggings in imitation leather', which is highly seasonal. We are currently in late October (Period 38, Oct 28). The Autumn peak regime (P33-P37) shows an average demand of approximately 84.6 units per period, with significant stockouts occurring because the current on-hand inventory cannot satisfy the seasonal surge. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' pipeline of 415 units covers the next few periods (P34 order of 154 due next, P35 order of 103, P36 order of 131, P37 order of 27), we must maintain high parameters to capture the remaining Autumn/Winter demand. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P33-P37) to capture this current high-demand regime (~85 units/period), resulting in a base stock target that accounts for 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (imitation leather leggings) is in its peak autumn/winter season. Current mean demand (P33-P38) is approximately 88.5 units/period, with notable volatility (demand ranging from 57 to 119). Period 38 saw demand of 108, confirming that high demand persists into late October/early November. On-hand inventory is 46, and a large pipeline of 311 units is expected to arrive starting next period (orders from P35, P36, P37, P38). Specifically, the P35 order (103 units) is due in P39's arrival phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and recent stockouts (P30-P37), I am setting mu_hat to reflect the current peak regime (N=6, P33-P38) to ensure the base stock level (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for approximately 440-450 units of demand. This will help the OR backend maintain a high service level during the seasonal peak while managing the large incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak sustained: Mean demand for P33-P38 is ~88.5 units, significantly higher than the previous autumn recovery mean of ~45.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its peak seasonal period (late autumn/early winter). Demand for Period 39 was 70 units, and the average over the last 7 periods (P33-P39) is approximately 85.8 units/period, confirming a high but volatile regime. I am selecting mu_hat based on the last 7 periods to capture this current peak average while remaining responsive to the recent fluctuation. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for the high variance observed during this peak (demand has ranged from 57 to 119 in this regime). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P34 and P35 both arrived with L=4). Pipeline inventory is high (333 units), which together with on-hand units (79), should adequately cover the lead time demand at these parameters, but a generous mu_hat and sigma_hat are necessary to maintain service levels during the peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) is currently in its peak seasonal regime (Autumn/Winter). The last period (P40) demand was 74, and the mean demand for the current regime (P33-P40) is approximately 84.4 units. While there was a minor softening in the last two periods (70, 74) compared to the peak spike of 119 (P33) and 108 (P38), demand remains high. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 136 units on-hand and 260 in-transit, the pipeline is relatively healthy. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime (P33-P40) and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to reflect the high volatility (SD \u2248 21 in this period). This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level that covers the (L+1) period demand (~420 units) while accounting for the high service level required by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak regime sustained: Mean demand for P33-P40 is ~84.4 units. High volatility persists (SD ~21 during peak).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its peak seasonal regime (Autumn/Winter), as confirmed by demand for imitation leather leggings remaining consistently high. In Period 41, demand was 93 units, and the average for the current regime (P33-P41) is approximately 85.3 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 6 periods remaining in the simulation (P42-P47), and a 4-period lead time, any order placed now will arrive in Period 46, impacting only the final two periods (46 and 47). Current on-hand (70) plus in-transit (297) totals 367 units, which roughly covers 4.3 periods of demand at the current high rate (~85 units/period). Given we are approaching the end of the game and the lead time constraint, I will maintain the current mu_hat based on the peak regime (N=9, covering P33-P41) to ensure we satisfy final demand without excessive overstocking in the final week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019-11-25 spiked to 191 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (late November). This represents a significant jump from the previous autumn/winter average of ~84 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, with 343 units in-transit. Given the product is 'imitation leather leggings', high demand is expected to continue through December. I am transitioning the forecast to a 'Winter Peak' regime. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 107.2 units; however, P42 is an outlier (191). Excluding the outlier, the mean is ~86. Including it, the mean is ~107. Since we are entering the Christmas shopping month, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the upward trend and the impact of the recent spike, which sets mu_hat to (1+L) * 107.2. Standard deviation has also increased due to the spike, so I will use recent_N with N=5 for sigma_hat to ensure a sufficient safety stock for high-volatility December demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Season Demand Spike: Demand reached 191 units in Period 42 (late November), marking a clear increase from the autumn mean of ~84 units, likely due to promotional events and winter seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak. In Period 42 (late Nov), demand spiked to 191 units, followed by 128 units in Period 43. The product (imitation leather leggings) is highly seasonal, peaking in autumn/winter. The recent demand regime (P42-P43) averages ~159.5 units, which is a significant step up from the autumn mean of ~84 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but 407 units are in-transit (L=4). Historically, shipments from P40 (58 units), P41 (64 units), P42 (96 units), and P43 (189 units) are expected. The OR backend needs to account for this higher volatility and volume. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-season surge while maintaining the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Peak Regime Confirmed: Demand for Period 42-43 averaged ~160 units, a ~90% increase over the previous autumn/winter mean of ~84 units, driven by December seasonality.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak regime. Analysis of the recent data confirms a significant demand surge: Period 42-44 demand (191, 128, 137) averages 152 units per period, which is roughly double the autumn mean of ~84. The product (imitation leather leggings) has high seasonal sensitivity to cold weather and holiday shopping. On-hand inventory is currently 0, indicating a stockout situation where we are entirely dependent on incoming shipments. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P40 order arrived P44). To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period, I will set mu_hat using N=3 (P42-P44) to capture the current holiday mean of ~152 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility observed during this peak (SD of P42-P44 is ~34). This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its peak winter demand regime (mid-to-late December). Current demand (P44-P45) has remained high and stable at 137 units per period, following the earlier holiday surge. However, the system is currently stock-out constrained, with on-hand inventory exhausted and sales limited by arrivals. To capture the full demand potential during this peak, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=4) to average the demand from P42-P45 (191, 128, 137, 137), which equals 148.25 per period. Multiplied by (1+L) where L=4, this provides a base mu_hat of ~741 units. Pipeline inventory is currently 714 units (from orders in P42-P45), which are expected to arrive in P46-P49. Given the Women's Nightwear/Leggings category likely experiences a post-Christmas demand drop, the OR backend's capping mechanism will help prevent excessive over-ordering as we move into January while still attempting to fulfill the current visible demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand stabilized: Mean demand for P44-P45 is 137 units, slightly lower than the P42-P43 average (~160) but consistently above the autumn mean of ~84.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are at the tail end of the holiday season and moving into January. Historical data from the beginning of the game (Feb 2019) shows demand ranging from 50-83 units. For the current period, demand has decreased from the holiday peak of ~160 units (P42-P43) to 112 units (P46), signaling the typical post-Christmas decline. I expect demand to continue softening toward the early spring mean observed in Feb 2019 (~65 units). While on-hand inventory is 0, there is a substantial pipeline of 700 units (orders from P43-P46). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To avoid over-ordering during the seasonal decline, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the downward trend from the holiday peak, which averages (137+137+112)/3 ~ 128 units over the last 3 periods, but using N=5 includes the 191 peak, so I will select mu_hat via recent_N=4 to focus on the immediate deceleration (mean ~144) while anticipating further drops. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle the volatility seen during these regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday seasonal decline detected: Demand dropped from ~160 (P42-P43) to 112 (P46), following the late December peak.
