Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 658030011 (Push Up Jeggings). Historical data for the past 5 weeks (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows an average demand of 85.2 units and a standard deviation of 25.1. The most recent demand (Feb 4) was 116 units, suggesting a potential upward trend as we move further into the spring season. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the first period of decision-making, there are no observed arrivals yet to verify actual lead time. The service level target (critical ratio) is high (19 / (19+1) = 0.95), suggesting we should carry enough stock to cover demand volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent regime while initializing the pipeline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Push Up Jegging L.W', a basic ladies' denim item. Initial demand in P1 was 136, which is higher than the mean of the pre-game samples (avg: 85.2). There is currently no on-hand inventory, and 129 units are in-transit from the P1 order. With a promised lead time of 4, we don't expect arrivals until P5 (visible in P6). Given the stockout in P1 (demand 136, sold 0), it is critical to set parameters that will allow the OR engine to place a sufficient order now to cover future demand plus safety stock. I will use the last 5 samples plus the P1 observation to estimate a slightly higher 'recent' demand, as the P1 demand of 136 suggests a possible upward trend or higher volatility than the earlier samples (53-116).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Historical demand for the last five weeks (83, 67, 107, 53, 116) plus periods 1 and 2 (136, 103) shows a mean demand of approximately 95 units per period. The product is a Jegging, which generally exhibits stable demand but can be influenced by spring fashion cycles in late February. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, no orders placed in Period 1 (arriving Period 5) or Period 2 (arriving Period 6) could have arrived yet. Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and sales have been 0 (lost sales). We must maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus the current review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 (all available data points including pre-game) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the recent demand (136, 103) is slightly higher than the earlier samples but not yet indicative of a sustained regime shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Ladies Denim Push Up Jegging'. Current date is March 4th. Historical demand samples (before P1) averaged ~85 units/period. Over the first three periods (P1-P3), observed demand was 136, 103, and 96, averaging 111.6 units. This suggests a higher demand regime than the pre-game samples, likely due to spring seasonality for denim. Promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in P1 (L=4) are expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in the P6 START observation. Therefore, arriving=0 in P1-P3 is expected. Total in-transit is 418 (129+146+143). Current on-hand is 0, meaning we have missed sales since P1. To recover and maintain a high service level (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period demand average (~112) scaled by (1+L=5), resulting in 560. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the variance of all available samples.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Ladies Denim Push Up Jegging', a core fashion staple. We are currently in Period 5 (March 11, 2019). Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has been consistent, ranging from 53 to 136, with a mean of approximately 93.6. Demand in the most recent 4 periods (136, 103, 96, 84) averages 104.75. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (129 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see in Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (as expected with L=4). Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 574. To protect against stockouts once the pipeline starts delivering, I will use recent_N for demand to capture the slightly higher average seen during the simulation periods (N=4). For sigma, I will use default to maintain a stable safety stock buffer based on the full sample set.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Push Up Jeggings', a staple denim item. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the Period 1 order arriving in the Period 5 conclude message (4 periods). The demand history shows: 83, 67, 107, 53, 116 (pre-game) and 136, 103, 96, 84, 88 (Periods 1-5). Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 101.4, which is slightly higher than the overall average (~93). Given the consistent 4-period lead time, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 41 and in-transit is 488 (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), totaling 529 units. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 captures the current demand regime more accurately than the long-term average, accounting for the slight increase in volume seen since Period 1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand regime stable around 95-105 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product is 'Push Up Jegging', a fashion item that generally experiences steady demand outside of major seasonal shifts. Reviewing the 'Period Conclude' messages, we confirmed in Period 6 that the actual lead time is 4 periods (matches promised). Historical demand since monitoring began at P1 consists of: 136, 103, 96, 84, 88, 84. The initial demand of 136 appears to be a slight outlier or initial burst; the last 5 periods show a stable mean around 91. The on-hand inventory is 103, with 397 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Given L=4, my parameters cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the last 5 samples (N=5) captures the stable regime post-outlier.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU 658030011 shows a significant spike in demand in Period 7 (160 units), nearly double the previous six periods' average (~90). This aligns with seasonal spring demand for 'Ladies Denim' and 'Push Up Jeggings' as weather warms up. The on-hand inventory is 86 and in-transit is 254 (representing orders from Periods 4, 5, 6, 7). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The OR backend needs to account for this recent demand surge to avoid stockouts during the L+1 window. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent trend including the 160-unit peak, providing a safer buffer against sustained higher demand, while keeping L at default (4) and sigma_hat at default to handle the recent volatility increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 7 (160 units vs ~90 average), likely seasonal shift for denim apparel in spring.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Historical data for this Push Up Jegging SKU showed a baseline demand around 80-100 units, with a significant spike (160 units) on March 25 (Period 7). The lead time is consistently 4 periods (order placed in P1 arrived in P5, P2 in P6, P3 in P7, P4 in P8). Currently, we have 145 units on hand and 257 in transit (from P5, P6, and P8 orders). While Period 8 demand returned to 97 units, April typically sees increased demand for spring denim. Given the lead time L=4, we must cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The historical average demand including the spike is approx 106 units/period. Over the last 4 periods (P5-P8), the mean is 107.25. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 captures the recent seasonality shift while maintaining stability. The sigma_hat is set to default to reflect the variance introduced by the P7 spike.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is Ladies Denim jeggings. Historical demand shows a baseline of ~90 units, with a significant seasonal spike in Period 7 (March 25, 160 units). Recent demand (Periods 8 and 9) has returned to lower levels (97, 82), but spring/early summer generally maintains higher interest for this category. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, and P9 arrivals all consistent). I will set L to 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the recent mean which includes the spike and subsequent normalization (avg ~107), providing a buffer for potential spring volatility. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (including the spike) to ensure the backend accounts for the volatility observed during the seasonal shift.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Push Up Jegging L.W' (Ladies Denim). Current date is April 22nd. Reviewing historical demand, we observed a spike in Period 7 (160 units), but demand has since softened significantly (82 units in Period 9 and 51 units in Period 10). This indicates that the earlier spike may have been a one-time event or that the spring demand peak has passed. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (confirmed by arrivals in periods 5, 6, 8, 9, 10). Pipeline inventory is currently high (473 units) relative to recent demand. Since demand has shifted from an average of ~95 to a much lower level (51 last period), I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This N captures the high demand in Period 7 and the recent low demand, allowing the model to adapt to the downward trend while maintaining safety stock for potential volatility. L remains at the default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Following a spike of 160 in Period 7, the last 4 periods have averaged ~97, with a recent low of 51 in Period 10.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/4/29), we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P5-P10, though P11 showed 0 arrivals because P7 had an order of 0). The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has significantly softened over the last three periods (51, 53, and 83 units) compared to the spring peak in P7 (160 units). The current on-hand inventory is 57 with 547 units in-transit. Given the high in-transit volume relative to the softening demand, the strategy is to adjust the forecast using the most recent 5 samples (P7-P11) to capture the transition from the peak to the current lower demand level. Setting L to 'calculate' uses the stable historical lead time. Using N=5 for demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering during this cooling period while accounting for the high volatility seen during the transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening trend confirmed: Post-spike (P7: 160), the 3-period trailing average (P9-P11) has dropped to 62 units, indicating the end of the spring peak for this SKU.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is 'Push Up Jeggings' (Ladies Denim), which saw a demand spike in late March (Period 7) and has since softened. Recent demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has been 97, 82, 51, 53, and 89, averaging 74.4 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P8 order arrived in P12). The pipeline inventory is currently 391 units (from orders in P9-P12), and on-hand is 127. With a lead time of 4 periods, we are planning for a (L+1) window of 5 periods. Total demand across 5 periods at the current average (74.4) is approximately 372 units. Since on-hand + pipeline (127 + 391 = 518) already exceeds this estimated demand significantly, we should minimize ordering to avoid high holding costs and inventory bloat as the spring peak subsides. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this softening trend compared to the early season high.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May. Historical demand shows a peak in late March (Period 7: 160 units) that has since settled into a lower regime. The last four periods (P10-P13) show demand values of 51, 53, 89, and 73, averaging approximately 66.5 units. The shipment from Period 7 (ordered=0) is technically 'concluded' by the arrival of the Period 8 order in Period 12, and the Period 9 order in Period 13, confirming the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is high (208) and in-transit is 237 (from P10, P11, P12). Given the 'softening' demand trend documented in carry-over insights and the current average, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the post-peak stabilization (~71 average) and recent_N of 4 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the spike period. L is stable at 4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a 'Push Up Jegging' (Women's Denim). Looking at the recent demand history, there was a spring peak in late March (Period 7: 160 units), followed by a sustained decline as the season transitioned towards summer. The demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has averaged 67.4 units (51, 53, 89, 73, 71), significantly lower than early-season levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Our on-hand inventory is currently high (297 units) due to large orders placed during the peak (P8-P10) arriving now. With an expected demand of ~70 units per period and a (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, we need roughly 350 units in the pipeline. Current total inventory (On-hand 297 + In-transit 77) is 374, which suggests we are slightly overstocked for the current demand regime. I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to capture this post-peak stabilization at a lower level (~67 units/period * (1+4) = 335), and sigma_hat using the same N to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the earlier spike period.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-spring peak has stabilized at a lower regime of ~65-75 units/period (average 67 over P10-P14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are post-spring peak for this denim item. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~70 units per period. Specifically, the average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 72 units. The on-hand inventory is currently high (297 units), which is approximately 4 periods of supply at the current demand rate. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since on-hand (297) plus in-transit (24) equals 321 units, and the expected demand over (L+1) periods is approximately 360 units (5 * 72), our pipeline is nearly full. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this stabilized post-peak demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to N=5 to capture recent volatility. L remains at the default (promised 4) as arrivals have been consistent with a 4-period lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Ladies Denim Push Up Jegging', which saw a significant spring demand spike (reaching 160 units in Period 7) and has since stabilized at a lower summer regime. For the last 5 periods (P12-P16), demand has averaged 74.4 units per period (89, 73, 71, 74, 65). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (235 units), which is approximately 3 periods of the current demand regime. Considering the pipeline inventory (108 units) consisting of orders from P15 (21 units) and P16 (87 units), the total inventory position is 343 units. With a lead time of 4 and the current period decision (L+1 = 5 periods), the target stock should cover roughly 5 * 74.4 = 372 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized post-peak regime and avoid over-ordering as we move further into the summer season.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern where demand spiked in late March (Period 7) and has since significantly softened and stabilized at a lower regime. Over the last 8 periods (P10-P17), demand has averaged 66.1 units per period, with recent values between 53 and 74. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of orders from P8, P9, P10, P11, and P12. The zero arrival in Period 17 is expected as no order was placed in Period 13. My on-hand inventory (182) and pipeline (170) are currently high relative to the stabilized demand. To avoid excessive holding costs while the backend manages the stock levels, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 to capture this lower demand regime (post-peak). This will align the mu_hat and sigma_hat with the current consumption rate of approximately 66 units/period, allowing the OR backend to properly use the base-stock policy given the SKU's high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P19 (mid-June). Historical data shows demand for these denim jeggings peaked in Period 7 (March/Spring) and has since softened significantly. Over the last 9 periods (P10-P18), the mean demand is 64.9 units, and more recently (P16-P18), it has stabilized even further around 57.6 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 127 units with 198 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, P18). To minimize holding costs during this low-demand summer period, I will set mu_hat to reflect the current softened regime using the last 9 periods (N=9, covering P10-P18), which better captures the post-peak stability than the full history. This prevents the OR engine from over-ordering based on the high spring demand seen earlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for Period 10-18 established at ~65 units/period, down from pre-peak levels of ~95. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (Push Up Jegging) has transitioned from a spring peak into a lower, stable summer regime. The demand in Period 19 was 38 units, reinforcing the softening trend noted in recent periods. Looking at the regime since the post-peak stabilization (Period 10 to Period 19), the average weekly demand is approximately 62 units. Specifically, the last 3 periods (P17-P19) have averaged about 49 units, but to avoid under-reacting to potential stabilization around the 60-unit mark, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the post-spring behavior. In terms of inventory, we have 110 on-hand and 225 in-transit. The in-transit includes orders from P16 (87), P17 (62), P18 (28), and P19 (48). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P15 order arriving in P19).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for Period 10-19 continues to settle lower, averaging ~62 units/period. The most recent three periods (P17-P19) show a further dip to an average of 48.6 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030011' (denim jeggings) has entered a mid-summer trough. Demand has decreased significantly over the last three periods (P18-P20: 55, 38, 22 units). The current period (P21, July 1st) reflects a low-demand regime typical for heavy denim after the spring peak and before any late-summer or back-to-school recovery. Current on-hand inventory (175) and in-transit (169) are sufficient given the current mean of ~38 units/period. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. Since demand is still potentially volatile during this transition, I will use a short-window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to sensitive the OR engine to the recent drop, preventing excessive over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock for standard variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: P18-P20 average dropped to 38.3 units/period, down from the P10-P17 average of ~65. Current date 2019/7/1 suggests a seasonal summer low for this denim SKU.

Analyzing the history, demand has dropped significantly from the spring peak (~100-160 units) and the post-peak stability (~65 units) to an even lower regime. The last four periods (P18-P21) show demand of 55, 38, 22, and 28 respectively, averaging 35.75 units. The current date (July 8) suggests this summer trough is likely to persist. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 209 units on-hand and 107 units in-transit (Total pipeline = 316), the inventory position is extremely high relative to the current demand regime. The target (1+L) period demand base stock (for L=4, 5 periods of demand) would be approximately 179 units at the current mean. Therefore, I am choosing recent_N (N=4) to capture this downward shift and allow the OR backend to minimize orders while the system works through the excess inventory to reduce holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease sustained: Period 18-21 average is 35.8 units/period, confirming a summer seasonal low for this denim SKU. Transitioned from ~62 average (P10-P19) to ~36.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, which is mid-summer for this denim SKU. Demand has dropped significantly from the spring peak (~160 at P7) and the subsequent stabilization phase (~65 units P10-P18). Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has averaged 36.4 units (55, 38, 22, 28, 39), confirming a summer seasonal low. The transition from the previous regime (~65) to this new lower regime (~36) is stable. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current summer demand level. I will use the same N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current lower volatility. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P19, P20, P21, and P22). On-hand inventory is high (198 units) relative to the current demand (~36/period), which covers several lead cycles. The OR backend will likely order 0 given the current pipeline and high inventory compared to the calculated base stock.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of jeggings (spring skinny denim). Current demand analysis shows a significant decrease from earlier regimes. Over the last 6 periods (P18-P23), demand has averaged 40.0 units per period (38, 22, 28, 39, 54, and the sample history shows a drop since mid-June). Although Period 23 saw a slight uptick to 54, the overall summer trend (July) for this specific item remains much lower than the spring peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 192 and in-transit at 31, total inventory is 223 units, which covers approximately 5.5 periods of demand at the current 40-unit average. Given the high stock relative to the current low-demand regime, a conservative mu_hat and sigma_hat are needed to prevent further overstocking while maintaining service levels should demand recover slightly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P18-P23 has stabilized at ~40 units/period, confirming the summer seasonal low (down from ~65 in P10-P17).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 658030011 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) has stabilized at a summer seasonal low. Over the last 7 periods (P18-P24), demand has averaged 37.7 units per period, consistently significantly lower than the P10-P17 average of ~65 and the early spring peak. Currently, on-hand inventory is 195 units, and 23 units are in-transit (ordered P24). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand regime (195 units covers more than 5 periods of demand at ~40 units/period), the OR backend should minimize ordering to avoid high holding costs while maintaining a service level for the low-demand period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this stabilized summer regime and 'default' for other parameters.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th (Period 26). The product is a summer-to-autumn transition item (stretch denim jeggings). Looking at the demand history, there was a significant summer trough (P18-P24) where demand averaged ~40 units. However, Period 25 shows an uptick to 72 units, which aligns with the typical 'Back to School' or late summer peak for denim. Following the regime detection logic, I am calculating the demand forecast using a 'recent_N' approach where N=8 (covering P18-P25) to capture the recent summer baseline while allowing the significant Period 25 jump to pull the average upward slightly (mean ~42). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P20 order arrived P24). The inventory position (On-hand: 123, In-transit: 112) is relatively high, so the OR backend will likely order minimally or zero unless the forecast implies a sustained higher trend. I am using 'calculate' for L to maintain the 4-period average and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to bridge the transition from the summer low to the expected autumn recovery.

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially exiting summer low: Period 25 demand (72) is significantly higher than the P18-P24 average (~40).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a denim jegging, which typically sees seasonal demand shifts. We are currently in mid-August (2019/08/12). Historical data shows a 'summer low' where demand averaged ~40 units (P18-P24). However, the last two periods (P25 and P26) have both recorded 72 units. This consistent increase suggests the autumn/back-to-school transition is starting, moving demand away from the summer trough. I am setting mu_hat based on the average of the last 3 samples (P24-P26: 28, 72, 72) which averages 57.3. Using N=3 for Recent_N captures this upward inflection while smoothing the single low point from P24. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P19, P20, P21, P22, P23, P24 all confirmed L=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand exiting summer low: Period 25 and 26 demand (72, 72) indicates a transition toward higher autumn demand levels, up from the ~40 unit average observed in P18-P24.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently transitioning out of a summer low (avg ~40) into an autumn demand period. Recent demand (P25-P27: 72, 72, 98) shows a clear upward shift. The most recent demand (P27: 98) and the overall context (August, autumn jeans season) suggest demand is returning to the ~95 units/period range observed earlier in the year (P1-P6). Period 27 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout (sold 51 vs demand 98), making aggressive replenishment necessary to meet the 19:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (95% service level). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*95 and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the recent increase in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition to autumn regime confirmed: Period 27 demand reached 98, aligning with pre-summer-low levels of ~95 units/period. The low-demand summer regime (P18-P24, avg ~40) has ended.

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently transitioning into an autumn demand regime. After a summer low (Periods 18-24, averaging ~40 units), demand has climbed back to an average of ~84 units over the last four periods (Periods 25-28: 72, 72, 98, 94). This aligns with pre-summer levels of ~95 units. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand), and we have experienced backorders in Periods 27 and 28 due to the faster-than-expected recovery. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new elevated regime while maintaining a standard observation window. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to provide enough cushion for the current volatility and prevent persistent stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 24 order in Period 28.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P25-P28 reached 84 units/period, marking a full recovery from the summer seasonal low (~40 units).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the autumn regime (September), which historically aligns with pre-summer-low levels (~95 units/period). Demand for P25-P29 has been 72, 72, 98, 94, 78 (average 82.8). Although Period 29 showed a slight dip to 78, the overall trend since P25 confirms a recovery from the summer low (~40). Inventory is currently very tight (on-hand = 11), though significant volume is in-transit (406 units total, with shipments from P26, P27, P28, and P29 pending). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recovered autumn demand level (~83 units/period) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this transition period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the autumn season (September), and demand has rebounded from the summer low (~40 units) to a stabilized autumn regime. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 94.4 units, very similar to the spring pre-peak levels. Notably, we are currently facing inventory stockouts (ending on-hand is 0) despite a large in-transit pipeline (411 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P26 order arrived in P30). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this established autumn demand level (approx. 94 units/period) while acknowledging the high volatility observed in P30 (demand=130). I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect this current volatility. The OR backend will see the massive in-transit pipeline and the stockout, and will adjust orders to maintain the base stock level required for a 4-period lead time plus 1-period review cycle.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand P26-P30 is 94.4 units/period, essentially returning to pre-summer levels. Stockouts occurring due to recent demand spikes (e.g., P30 demand of 130).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn demand regime for this SKU is now clearly established and significantly higher than the summer low. Demand over the last five periods (P27-P31) has averaged 104.8 units, compared to the summer average of ~40. We are currently experiencing stockouts (0 on-hand), with P31 demand at 124 units. Total pipeline inventory is 443 units, which includes 138 (P28), 130 (P29), 43 (P30), and 132 (P31). The P28 order is due to arrive this period (P32). Given the sustained autumn recovery and recent spikes (P30: 130, P31: 124), I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean (~105) and increased volatility. L remains calculated at the observed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed significantly higher: P27-P31 average is 104.8 units/period, compared to the P18-P24 summer average of ~40 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 658030011 (Push Up Jeggings) shows a significant shift from the summer low (~40 units/period) to a robust autumn regime. In the last five periods (P28-P32), demand has averaged 109.8 units (94, 78, 130, 124, 123), which is slightly higher than the pre-summer average of ~95. The most recent three periods (P30-P32) specifically average 125.6 units, indicating a potential escalation or peak in the autumn season. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in P32's conclusion: P28 order arrived in P32). Pipeline inventory is high (446 units), but on-hand inventory is very low (15 units) due to recent stockouts (P30, P31). To prevent further stockouts during this strong autumn demand and account for the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the current ~110 unit average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility (ranging from 78 to 130) in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime established at ~110 units/period (P28-P32 average 109.8), significantly exceeding previous stabilized estimations of ~95. High volatility observed with peak demand reaching 130 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is experiencing a significant autumn/winter demand surge. In Period 33 (Sept 23), demand spiked to 230 units, far exceeding the recent stabilized average of ~110. This surge, combined with stockouts in the last five periods (P27, P28, P30, P31, P33), indicates that the autumn demand regime is both higher and more volatile than previously estimated. The average demand for the last five periods (P29-P33) is 157 units, drastically pulled up by the recent 230-unit peak. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), mu_hat must be adjusted to account for this higher regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent trend (approx 157/week * 5 weeks = 785). Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' N=5 will reflect the increased volatility (Std Dev of {78, 130, 124, 123, 230} is approx 55, which scaled for L+1 is significant).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected: P33 demand spiked to 230 units. The 5-period average (P29-P33) has risen to 157 units/period, indicating a potential early winter peak or high-volatility autumn regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October (Period 35), and demand has spiked significantly, with recent demand reaching 230 and 117 in the last two periods. The carry-over insights indicate an autumn/winter demand regime transition. Although P34 demand (117) was lower than P33 (230), the 5-period average (P30-P34) is roughly 145 units/period. The current 'In-transit' of 650 units covers about 4-5 periods of this elevated demand, which aligns with the 4-period lead time. However, persistent stockouts (ending inventory 0 for 5 out of the last 8 periods) suggest the backend's current base stock is too low. To capture the recent volatility and the potential start of a higher winter plateau, I am switching mu_hat to a recent_N calculation using N=5 (P30-P34) to reflect the 145 unit/period average. This will properly adjust the base stock to target a higher service level during this volatile growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing in autumn regime: P30-P34 average is 144.8 units, but includes a significant peak of 230 (P33) and multiple stockouts. Current pipeline of 650 units is being adjusted to meet this ~145 unit/period average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2248.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the mid-October period (2019/10/14), which is historically a high-growth phase for denim as temperatures drop. Recent demand underscores this: Period 33 peaked at 230, and while Periods 34-35 'cooled' to 117-119, these were likely constrained by low on-hand inventory availability. The demand regime from P33-P35 has averaged 155 units. Given the transition into a potential winter peak, I am utilizing an explicit mu_hat based on an average of 150 units per period across the (L+1=5) period horizon (150 * 5 = 750). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (P24-P31 all arrived with L=4). Although on-hand inventory is low (13), the pipeline is substantial (742), including a large order of 141 units expected to arrive this period (ordered P32). This strategy maintains a high service level to capture seasonal upside while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Mid-October demand (P33-P35) has shifted to a high-volatility regime averaging ~155 units/period, up from the ~110 autumn average.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in a high-volatility autumn/early winter regime for this denim SKU. Demand for the last four periods (P33-P36) has been 230 (stockout), 117 (stockout), 119, and 118, with an average around 146 units. However, the peak of 230 suggests that the true mean might be higher if stockouts hadn't occurred. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, the OR engine covers demand for 5 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this shift toward ~146 units/period (total mu_hat ~730) and account for the high volatility by using recent_N for sigma_hat as well. On-hand inventory is low (36), but there is a substantial pipeline (777) arriving soon based on recently increased order sizes.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility demand regime confirmed from Period 33 onwards, averaging ~150 units/period (observed: P33=230, P34=117, P35=119, P36=118). Stockouts in P33 and P34 suggest demand may exceed observed sales.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is currently in a high-volatility autumn/pre-winter regime. Since Period 33, demand has been characterized by a significant spike (230 units) followed by stabilization around 115-120 units (P34-P37: 117, 119, 118, 115). However, stockouts in P33 and P34 suggest the true underlying demand might be higher than historical sales. The date (Oct 28) and product type (denim jeggings) suggest we are in a peak season. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P33-P37) to capture this recent high-volatility average (~140 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to maintain sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period while accounting for the significant in-transit pipeline (753 units) currently scheduled to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 33-37 stabilized at ~140 units/period (sales + estimated lost demand from stockouts), confirming a robust autumn/pre-winter peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 33-38) has stabilized around an average of 140-150 units/period, factoring in actual sales and lost demand from previous stockouts. The current date (2019/11/04) suggests we are entering the peak late-autumn/early-winter shopping season for denim jeggings. While the last period demand was 150, the 5-period average (P34-P38) is approximately 124 units of realized sales, but with significant stockouts previously, the underlying demand is likely closer to 145-150. Based on the Carry-over Insight from Period 38, I will use an explicit mu_hat grounded in the ~140 unit/period estimate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 700 (5 periods * 140 units) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high volatility in the autumn peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1568.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-November, approaching the peak holiday season. Current demand observations from Period 33-39 show a high-volatility regime with an average of approximately 134 units/period (P33-P39 sales: 230, 117, 119, 118, 115, 150, 97). However, stockouts in P33 and P34 imply true latent demand was higher. The Carry-over Insights suggest a regime level of ~140-150 units. While demand in P39 dipped to 97, this is likely a temporary fluctuation before the late November/December surge for denim apparel. I will maintain a mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (P33-P39) to capture this recent high-volatility regime, which averages 135 units. Applying (1+L) logic with L=4, mu_hat = 5 * 135 = 675. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over these 7 periods to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation of P33-P39 is approx 44; sqrt(5)*44 \u2248 98). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1389.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (2019/11/18). Historical data from Period 33 onwards showed a high-volatility regime averaging ~140-150 units, but the last two periods (P39, P40) have seen a slight cooling to 97 and 92 units. However, looking at the previous autumn patterns, volatility is high and stockouts are costly. Current on-hand is healthy at 359, and in-transit is 389. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the average of the high-demand autumn regime (P33-P40), which averages approximately 130 units per period. This balances the recent lower observations with the previous high spikes of 230 to prevent stockouts as we enter the holiday season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 33-40 shows high volatility with an average of ~130 units/period (reflecting autumn/pre-winter peak). Recent two periods (P39-P40) softened to ~95 units, but risk of spikes remains high based on P33 (230) and P38 (150).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 658030011 shows a peak in late October (P33-P38) averaging ~140-150 units, which has now softened to a stable plateau of ~95 units over the last three periods (P39-P41: 97, 92, 95). This likely reflects the post-autumn/pre-holiday phase for denim. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the P37 order arrival in P41. Pipeline inventory is healthy (329 units), and on-hand inventory is strong (387 units) due to large orders placed during the October peak now arriving. Given the stability of the last 3 periods and the proximity to the holiday season where demand might spike again or drop, I will use a 5-period average (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent softening while still weighing some of the higher demand from Period 38 (150). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the current moderate volatility. This approach ensures high service levels for potential late November/December surges without excessive over-ordering, as the OR backend will subtract the substantial pipeline and on-hand inventory from the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening post-October peak: P39-P41 average is 94.7 units, down from the P33-P38 average of ~140.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering December (Date: 2019/12/2). Historically, the autumn/pre-winter peak (P33-P38) averaged ~140-150 units/period (accounting for stockouts), but the most recent four periods (P39-P42: 97, 92, 95, 109) have stabilized at a lower average of ~98 units/period. This suggests a post-peak plateau before potential holiday/winter clearance shifts. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (~98 * 5 = 490) to avoid overstocking while keeping sigma_hat reflective of the recent volatility (standard deviation from P39-P42). With on-hand inventory at 342 and in-transit at 265 (Total: 607), and an expected pipeline requirement of roughly 490-550 units, the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order this period to lean out inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand softening confirmed: Period 39-42 demand has stabilized at an average of 98.25 units/period, down from the Period 33-38 high-volatility average of ~145 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Ladies Denim Jegging) is currently in a post-peak seasonal phase. After a high-volatility autumn regime (avg ~145 units), demand has softened significantly over the last 5 periods (P39-P43: 97, 92, 95, 109, 44), averaging 87.4 units. Specifically, the drop to 44 units in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019) suggests a sharp seasonal winding down or transition into early December low. Current on-hand inventory (430) plus in-transit (133) totals 563 units. With the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the recent average of ~87 units, our pipeline coverage is approximately 6.5 periods, which is sufficient. Given the sharp drop in P43, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this softening trend while maintaining a buffer against the high volatility seen in Oct/Nov. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current variance. Lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening further in early December: Period 43 demand dropped to 44 units, bringing the five-period average (P39-P43) down to 87.4 units from the previous average of ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1040.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a sustained softening phase following the autumn/pre-winter peak. The five-period average (P40-P44) is 83.4 units, with the most recent two periods (P43-P44) averaging only 60.5 units. Current on-hand inventory (423) is high relative to this softened demand, especially considering the game is approaching its final periods (P45 of 47). Since the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 49, which is past the game's end. Therefore, the priority is to utilize existing inventory (On-hand: 423 + In-transit: 63 = 486 units total) to meet remaining demand (P45, P46, P47) and minimize holding costs for ending inventory. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the recent softening trend (N=5 for mu_hat) and maintain the stable lead time estimate (L=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime secondary softening confirmed in mid-December: Period 43-44 average is 60.5 units, down from the Period 39-42 average of 98.25. Game nearing conclusion; pipeline and on-hand inventory are sufficient for remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1354.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019). The game is nearly over (Period 47 is the likely last period). Current on-hand inventory is 394 units, and demand has softened significantly since the October peak, averaging ~80 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P41-P45). With ONLY 1-2 periods remaining and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now will not arrive until Period 50, well after the game concludes. Therefore, we should stop ordering to avoid excessive holding costs on the 394 units already on hand, which are more than sufficient to cover the remaining demand. I will set mu_hat to a low 'recent_N' average to reflect the late-season softening and prevent the OR backend from triggering a large order, effectively winding down the inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for mid-to-late December (P41-P45) has stabilized at a lower average of ~81 units per period, down from the autumn peak. Game nearing conclusion; focus is clearing existing on-hand inventory (394 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1106.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 (Final Period). The date is 2019/12/30. Total inventory (on-hand 319 + in-transit 115) is 434 units. Demand has stabilized at a late-December average of ~81 units (P41-P45). With the game concluding, any order placed now (Period 47) would not arrive until Period 51 (lead time 4), which is past the game's horizon. The primary objective in the final period is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Current inventory (434 units) is far more than enough to cover the final period's demand (expected ~80 units). To prevent unnecessary ordering and minimize costs, I am setting the lead time to 'default' (4) and forcing the order quantity to zero using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat with a value of 0. This ensures the backend base stock calculation falls below existing inventory (on-hand + pipeline), resulting in no further units ordered.
