Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for Julia RW Skinny Denim Trousers. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 78.6 units (72, 81, 71, 78, 91), showing a slight upward trend in the most recent week. The product is 'superstretch washed denim', a staple item in the 'Divided Collection'. Given the date is mid-February, we are transitions into spring fashion cycles, which often sees stable or increasing demand for denim. Promised lead time (L) is 4. Since we have no inventory (On-hand: 0, In-transit: 0) and no prior history, I will use all 5 historical samples to set the baseline demand. Mu_hat will be calculated as (1+L) * mean demand (5 * 78.6 = 393). Sigma_hat will be sqrt(1+L) * std demand. I'll use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent mean and variance, and 'default' for L since we have no actual lead time data yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a staple item (Superstretch Skinny Denim). In Period 1, demand was 126, which is significantly higher than the initial historical samples (mean ~79). This suggests the historical samples might be pre-season or the product is entering a higher demand phase in mid-February. Because on-hand inventory was 0, we had a stockout (sold 0). In-transit inventory is 92 units (ordered in P1), and with a promised lead time of 4, they aren't expected yet. I will set L to 'default' (4). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (incorporating the 5 historical samples plus the high P1 observation) to capture the upward trend while acknowledging the small sample size. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect the increased volatility from the P1 spike.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a skinny denim trouser SKU. There is a clear stockout: on-hand inventory is 0, and we have failed to satisfy demand in Periods 1 and 2 (126 units each). Historical samples from Jan-Feb 2019 show mean demand around 78.6, but the transition into late February shows a significant jump to 126 units (+60%). This suggests a late-winter/spring-collection demand surge. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 and 2 (totaling 213 in-transit) are not expected until Period 5 and 6 respectively. To address the stockout and the regime shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the lead up and the recent spike) to ensure the OR backend increases the base stock level significantly. Lead time L is kept at default as we haven't seen any arrivals to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods yet.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 1: demand increased from ~79 avg in Jan/Early Feb to 126 (+60%) in late February.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' is experiencing a significant demand surge compared to the Jan/early Feb baseline (avg ~75.4), with late Feb demand averaging 118.67 (126, 126, 104). We are currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) and awaiting the first orders. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4 means N+4), and will be visible in the Period 6 start observation. Consequently, we have not yet observed any 'conclude' messages confirming actual lead time. I will maintain L=4 (default). For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent regime shift (Avg=118.67). Over 5 periods (1+L), mu_hat = ~593. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the current volatility during this stock-out phase.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple item. Initial context showed a demand shift around mid-February to ~126 units, but the last two periods (P3 and P4) showed a cooling trend (104 then 86). Using all 9 available samples (5 historical + 4 game history), the mean is approx 93. Given the recent drop, using the last 5 samples (121, 126, 126, 104, 86) gives a mean of 112.6. Promised lead time (L) is 4. No orders have arrived yet, which is expected as the first order (P1) is due in Period 5's arrival phase and will be visible in Period 6's conclude message. Pipeline inventory is currently 495 (92+121+142+140), covers the immediate lead time. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the shift from the Jan baseline while acknowledging the recent stabilization, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this higher demand regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', which seen a demand spike in February. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has averaged 106.2 units (126, 126, 104, 86, 89). The demand seems to be stabilizing from the initial spike but remains higher than the January historical average of ~78. The first shipment ordered in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), but the pipeline is full (441 in-transit). Since L=4 is confirmed, I will use L=4. For mu_hat, I'll use the average of the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the higher post-January demand regime. For sigma_hat, I'll also use recent_N=5 to account for the volatility seen in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Demand stabilized around 106 units/period (average over P1-P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', which has shown a demand shift since late February. Demand over the last 6 periods averages 107.5 units, which is higher than the initial January samples (~79). Current on-hand is low (10 units), but we have 407 units in-transit. Arrivals in Period 5 and 6 confirm the actual lead time is 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the demand has stabilized at a higher level than January but fluctuates week-to-week (std dev approx 18.5 for the last 6 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the observed lead times are consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Since the arrivals started in Period 5, confirmed by 'conclude' messages For P1, P2, and P3, the supply chain is now flowing. Demand has shifted from the pre-game average of ~79 to a current post-start average of 104.4 units per period (Periods 1-7). Although there are slight fluctuations (ranging from 86 to 126), there is no clear seasonal trend evidence suggesting a massive spike or drop for April yet. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 7 periods of actual performance since the game started. Pipeline inventory (386) plus on-hand (66) totals 452, which covers roughly 4.3 periods of demand at the 104 rate. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods. The OR engine will order the difference to maintain the base stock level. I use recent_N=7 for demand to capture the higher post-start mean compared to the initial sample data.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are managing Julia RW Skinny Denim. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, with orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arriving exactly 4 periods after being placed. Demand has shown significant variability lately, jumping from an average of ~86-89 in early March to 143 in the most recent period (P8). This aligns with seasonal transitions in spring fashion. The demand mean across the last 8 periods is approximately 109.75, but the recent spike to 143 suggests a possible shift toward a higher regime. To maintain high service levels while respecting the equal profit/holding cost ratio ($1.0/$1.0), I will use 'recent_N' for the last 5 periods (P4-P8) to capture this rising trend. This N=5 period demand average is ~103.6. For mu_hat (1+L)*demand, utilizing recent_N (N=5) will provide a responsive but balanced forecast. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility seen in the last period's jump.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Demand spike detected (143 units), potentially signaling a seasonal shift for spring denim fashion. Mean demand for P4-P8 is 103.6 compared to previous stabilization at 106.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we observe the SKU 554450004 (Julia RW Skinny Denim). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by multiple arrivals in P5-P9). Demand is currently in a spring-season phase. From P1-P9, demand has averaged 106.2. Looking at more recent data, P5-P9 demand is 104 (89, 114, 86, 143, 88). The spike to 143 in P8 appears to be a transient outlier or a short-lived peak rather than a sustained shift, as P9 returned to 88. However, given it is mid-April, some seasonal variability is expected. I will use N=5 for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture this recent spring variability (avg 104) while maintaining enough buffer for the lead time (L=4 implies a 5-period horizon). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to account for the heightened volatility seen recently (std approx 24.5). Parameters will maintain a base stock targeting ~520 units for the (L+1) horizon.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for skinny denim trousers typically shows spring seasonality but has recently trended downwards over the last few periods (88 and 66 units) after a spike in Period 8 (143 units). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 99.4 units, which is lower than the early spring peak but higher than some earlier troughs. Pipeline inventory is currently 507 units (420 in-transit + 87 arriving or recently arrived), but we must ensure we cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L = 5). I will use a recent_N window for demand (N=5) to capture the current post-spike stabilization while smoothing out the high variance seen in April. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P5 through P10). sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 5 periods to account for the increased volatility observed in the spring demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-spike: average demand for P6-P10 is 99.4 units with high volatility (sigma), following the early April spike.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/29. The product is skinny denim trousers. Recent demand shows a significant downward trend: P9 (88), P10 (66), P11 (51). This suggests the spring peak observed in early April (P8: 143) has concluded, and we are entering a lower demand regime or post-peak lull. The average demand over the last 3 periods is 68.3 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P1-P7 arrivals). With on-hand inventory at 104 and in-transit at 342 (ordered P8-P11), our pipeline is currently high relative to the slowing demand. To prevent excess holding costs as demand cools, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the immediate downward trend and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to maintain enough safety stock for volatility while demand settles. L remains at the promised/observed level of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 11: post-spring peak decline observed over P9-P11 with average demand dropping to 68.3 units (-32% from previous average).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th. The product is standard skinny denim jeans. Historical demand shows a significant drop starting in mid-April (Period 10), likely indicating the end of the high-demand spring denim cycle. Recent demand for periods 10, 11, and 12 were 66, 51, and 72 units respectively, averaging 63 units/period. This is a clear downward shift compared to the March-April period (which averaged ~100+). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 103 and a large pipeline of 271 units (ordered in Periods 9, 10, and 11), we are currently overstocked for the new demand regime (total pipeline + on-hand = 374, while expected demand over L+1 periods at 63 units/period is only ~315). I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and reduced volatility, helping the OR backend adjust to the lower necessary base stock and potentially pause ordering to burn through excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 10: average weekly demand dropped to ~63 units (-37% from previous spring average) as the peak denim season concludes.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the product (denim skinny jeans) has clearly exited its spring peak. Demand has consistently dropped and stabilized at a lower level since early May. Over the last four periods (P10-P13), demand has been 66, 51, 72, and 64, averaging 63.25 units per period. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 13. Currently, the inventory position is high: 177 units on-hand plus 133 in-transit (orders from P10-P11), totaling 310 units. Against a demand forecast of ~63 units/period and a 4-period lead time, 310 units covers nearly 5 periods of demand. Given the equal weight of Profit and Holding Cost ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50%, meaning we should aim for leaner inventory. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P9.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand shows a confirmed seasonal decline in late April and May, coinciding with the end of the peak spring denim season. Mean demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is approximately 65.2 units (66, 51, 72, 64, 73), which is a significant drop from the earlier spring average of ~100. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (194 units) relative to this newer demand regime. With 50 units in transit (ordered in P11) and the observed demand average, our current inventory + pipeline is approximately 244 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of demand at the current rate. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized lower demand of the last 5 periods. Using L=default as lead time is consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-spring peak: average weekly demand over P10-P14 is 65.2 units, confirming a sustained lower demand level compared to the spring peak (~100 units).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27, 2019. We are in a post-spring peak regime for denim. Looking at the last 6 periods (P10-P15), demand has been: 66, 51, 72, 64, 73, 65. The mean of this stable period is 65.17 units with a standard deviation of 8.01. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every period from P5 through P15 (11 consecutive observations). On-hand inventory is currently high (172 units), ensuring no imminent stockout, but we must align order parameters with the new lower demand level to manage holding costs. I will use N=6 for both mean and volatility to reflect this recent stable regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the product 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' has entered a stable low-demand regime following the spring peak. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P10-P16) is 63.3 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on historical arrivals (P1 through P11 order arrivals confirmed this). The arrival for the order placed in P12 (which was 0 units) correctly correlates with the 0 units arrived in Period 16 conclude. I have an on-hand inventory of 120 and a pipeline of 154 units (orders from P13, P14, P15, P16), totaling 274 units of inventory position. This position is sufficient to cover approximately 4+ periods of current demand (~63 units/period). I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods to capture this sustained lower demand level while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. This product is Julia RW Skinny Denim, which has seen a sustained demand decrease since mid-April following its spring peak. In the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has averaged 59 units, showing a further decline from the 65 unit average observed in P10-P14. The recent demand (P16: 52, P17: 41) suggests we are moving into a summer low-season. Although the promised lead time is 4 periods, we have observed two consecutive periods (P16, P17) where no arrivals occurred despite orders being placed in P12 (0 units) and P13 (0 units). While P13 had an arrival of 138 units, subsequent orders were small or zero, and the pipeline inventory currently sits at 197 units. With on-hand inventory at 79 and demand dropping, the primary risk is overstocking due to high holding costs ($1/unit/period). I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current lower demand trend (avg ~59) and using calculation for L to maintain accuracy based on actual arrival history. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to account for the current demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand regime shift continues downward post-spring peak; average weekly demand for P13-P17 dropped to 59.0 units (-10% from the previous P10-P14 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), demand for skinny denim has clearly entered a late-spring/summer trough. Looking at the last five periods (P14-P18), demand has been: 73, 65, 52, 41, 37. This shows a steady decline from the mid-60s to the high-30s. The average for the last 5 periods is 53.6 units/period, but the most recent 3 periods average only 43.3. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend without overreacting to a single week, while acknowledging that the pipeline is currently very full (209 units in-transit vs a weekly demand < 40). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P14 order arrived in P18). The high in-transit inventory relative to current demand means the OR backend will naturally reduce order quantities to prevent excessive holding costs, especially since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level (q) of 0.50.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: significant downward trend continuing through June; average weekly demand for P16-P18 dropped to 43.3 units, signaling the end of the high-demand season for this denim SKU.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we are in a sustained low-demand regime for this super-skinny denim SKU. The demand over the last three weeks has averaged 43 units (P17: 41, P18: 37, P19: 51), which is a significant drop from the spring average. This aligns with seasonal expectations for heavy denim as temperatures rise. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P18 and P19). I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most current demand floor (~43 units) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. We have 78 on-hand and 139 in-transit (orders from P16, P17, P18, P19). The pipeline is sufficient, so I will rely on the OR backend's base-stock calculation to maintain a lean inventory and minimize holding costs while the demand is low.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a seasonal low: average demand for P17-P19 is 43.0 units, down from the ~65 units observed in May.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in July, typically a low season for skinny denim as summer temperatures peak. Historical demand shows a severe downward trend: demand in Period 20 plummeted to 17 units, significantly lower than the previous weeks (37, 51). The 3-period average (P18-P20) is 35 units per week, but the most recent observation is much lower, signaling potential further decline or a very low basement. On-hand inventory is 128 units and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 72 units, totaling 200 units of stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the extremely low demand (17) compared to the current stock levels (200), we are overstocked for the current demand regime (at 35 units/period, 200 units covers >5 weeks). I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime shift (N=3) to minimize further ordering and allow on-hand inventory to deplete, as holding costs ($1) equal profit ($1) per unit, making overstocking very expensive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime collapsed further in late June: Period 20 demand (17 units) is 60% lower than the P17-P19 average (43 units), confirming a summer seasonal trough for denim.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450004' (Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a high-volatility summer phase. While previous insights suggested a seasonal collapse, Period 21 saw a significant demand rebound (96 units) compared to the Period 20 low (17 units). This suggests that while mean demand has decreased from the spring peak (~100), it has not flatlined. The current average demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 48.4 units. Since on-hand inventory (75) plus in-transit (29) totals 104 units, and the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, we are currently covered for approximately two periods of average demand. To avoid overstocking during this volatile summer period, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the recent mean of ~48 units per period (totaling ~242 for the lead+review window), while using recent_N for sigma to account for the high variance observed between P20 and P21. Lead time remains 'calculate' as the 4-period delivery is highly consistent.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Demand volatility increased in July; demand rebounded to 96 units in P21 after a low of 17 in P20, suggesting a fluctuating summer floor rather than a total collapse.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in a highly volatile summer period for this SKU. After a seasonal low in late June (P20 demand = 17), demand has rebounded significantly in the last two periods (P21 = 96, P22 = 132), resulting in a stockout at the end of Period 22. This suggests a shift toward a mid-summer peak or clearance activity. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on recent history (P18 order arrived in P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and pipeline inventory is 107 units (orders from P19, P20, and P22, noting that P20 and P21 orders were 0). Specifically, P19 (10 units) should arrive in P23, and P22 (97 units) should arrive in P26. To address the recent spike and stockout, I am using a recent window of 3 periods (P20-P22) for mu_hat to capture the upward trend (avg ~81). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the extreme volatility observed between P18 and P22 (37 to 132). These settings aim to restore stock levels through the OR engine's base-stock calculation while respecting the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in July: significant rebound from June seasonal low (avg demand jumped from 43 to 81.7 over P20-P22), leading to stockouts.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late July (P24). A major demand rebound occurred starting P21, with demand levels hitting 96, 132, and 142 units in the last three periods. This represents a significant shift from the June seasonal trough (~40 units/period) and exceeded my previous inventory positions, resulting in stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods. Since the current demand regime (P21-P23) shows a sharp increase, I will use recent_N (N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand momentum. Specifically, the mean demand of the last 3 periods is ~123.33 units. Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L) = 5 periods of this heightened demand ensures we attempt to restock sufficiently to meet this mid-summer recovery.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in July: Period 21-23 average demand jumped to 123.3 units, signaling a strong seasonal recovery or promotion impact following the June trough (avg ~43).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' is experiencing a sharp seasonal rebound in late July. Recent demand observations for Periods 21-24 are 96, 132, 142, and 99, resulting in a 4-period average of 117.25. This confirms the 'July rebound' noted in previous insights. The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline (420 units) due to aggressive ordering in P22-P24 to catch up with the surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P19 order arrived at P23). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current high-demand regime (avg ~117/week), ensuring the base stock level (1+L)*117 = 585 is sufficient to cover demand during the 4-period lead time plus the review period until the next order arrives. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect current high volatility/growth. This strategy aims to replenish inventory quickly while the SKU experiences its summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand regime confirmed for late July: Period 21-24 average demand is 117.3, a ~170% increase over the June trough (~43).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/05. The product is a denim SKU. We are currently experiencing a significant mismatch between supply and demand due to a sharp seasonal recovery in July that caught the system with low inventory. Demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 112.2 units (96, 132, 142, 99, 92), a drastic increase from the June trough (~43). However, we are currently stockouted (on-hand: 0) and awaiting arrivals. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The orders from Period 22 (97 units) and Period 23 (159 units) are expected in Period 26 and Period 27 respectively. We must maintain high mu_hat and sigma_hat settings to allow the OR engine to place large enough orders to refill the pipeline and cover the ongoing high demand regime. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand average of ~112 units, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility during this late-summer recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime in late July/early August: Average demand for P21-P25 is 112.2 units, confirming a full recovery from the June seasonal low.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450004' (Super-skinny denim) is in a high-demand late-summer/back-to-school phase. Demand peaked in July/August, averaging 112.2 units over P21-P25. Period 26 demand remained high at 136 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P22 order arrived in P26). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling all 97 units that arrived. There is a significant pipeline of 479 units (orders from P23, P24, P25), with the P23 order (159 units) expected to arrive in Period 27. To maintain the service level during this high-demand regime while respecting the pipeline, I will use recent_N=6 (P21-P26) to capture the current high mean (~116 units) and volatility. This will ensure the base stock levels cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: demand for P21-P26 averaged 116.2 units, a significant recovery from the June trough, likely driven by back-to-school seasonality for denim.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 28 (mid-August). The carry-over insights and recent history confirm a significant demand surge for this denim SKU, likely driven by 'Back-to-School' shopping. Demand in Period 27 hit a new peak of 180 units. The average demand for the last three periods (P25-P27) is 136 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization around 112-116. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline in transit (422 units). Given the consistent lead time of 4 periods, orders placed now cover demand from P28 through P32. To prevent further stockouts during this seasonal peak, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 7 periods (covering the transition and peak) to capture the upward momentum while acknowledging historical volatility. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this same N=7 window to account for the increased variance seen in July and August (range 92 to 180). Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school peak intensifying: Demand reached 180 units in Period 27, marking a 50% increase over the late-July/early-August average (~116).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the back-to-school season for denim (late August). Demand has surged significantly, with the last two periods showing demand of 180 and 167 units respectively. The average demand over the last four periods (P25-P28) is 143.75 units. Despite recent arrivals, on-hand inventory is zero due to high demand exceeding supply. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 436 units, including orders from P25 (156), P27 (102), and P28 (178). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma) during this peak and the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (suggesting a 50% service level target in the base stock formula), I will set mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (N=4) to ensure the base stock captures the current peak, while relying on the pipeline to cover the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school peak confirmed: Demand averaged 143.8 units over P25-P28, a 24% increase over the early August average (~116).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450004' (Superstretch Skinny Denim) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime driven by back-to-school seasonality. Demand surged from a June low (~43 units) to an average of ~143.8 units over the last four periods (P25-P28), peaking at 180 units in P27. The most recent demand (P29: 134 units) suggests the peak may be plateauing or slightly cooling, but aggregate demand remains high. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 22 units on hand and a high pipeline, the key is to ensure the base stock covers (L+review) periods of high demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 to capture this high-demand regime (avg over P25-P29 is 141.8) and recent_N for \u03c3\u0302 to account for the increased volatility during this period. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will calculate via z*. The current in-transit (489) is substantial, so the backend's capped policy will manage the actual order quantity to prevent overstocking as we move past the Labor Day peak into September.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school peak for denim plateauing in late August: Average demand for P25-P29 is 141.8 units, compared to the P25-P28 average of 143.8. Seasonal high demand is sustained but may have peaked.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September, following a significant back-to-school peak for denim. Recent demand from Period 27-30 shows levels of 180, 167, 134, and 165 units, resulting in an average of 161.5 units per period. While the 'plateau' was mentioned in Period 30's carry-over, the latest demand of 165 units suggests the peak is still very active and volatile. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with high in-transit volumes reaching maturity soon. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (P27-P30) to capture this high-demand regime (avg ~161.5) and ensure L+1 coverage. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current high volatility. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school peak remains high in early September: Average demand for P27-P30 is 161.5 units, which is higher than the previously estimated August plateau of 141.8.

The current date is September 16, 2019, which is just after the peak back-to-school season for denim. Demand has remained very high, with a significant spike to 206 units in Period 31. This confirms that the demand level is sustained above the 140-160 range observed in late August. Inventory is currently zero, and we have 706 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and recent surge, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the high September demand levels for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current high-demand regime (averaging ~170 units/period) while we navigate the transition from back-to-school into the fall season.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: Average weekly demand for P27-P31 is 170.4 units, representing a sustained increase over the August plateau of 141.8 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450004 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a sustained high-demand period associated with September back-to-school and early autumn seasonality. The demand for the most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) has averaged 172.8 units (167, 134, 165, 206, 142), confirming the surge identified in previous periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of orders from P27 and P28 in P31 and P32. On-hand inventory is low (36), and there is a large pipeline (674 units), but the OR backend must maintain a high base stock to cover the L+1 (5-period) risk horizon during this high-demand stage. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-mean and high-volatility regime (sigma is elevated due to the 206-unit spike).

Carry-over insight: September demand surge sustained: Average weekly demand for P28-P32 is 172.8 units, maintaining the high-demand regime throughout early autumn.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' is in its peak autumn/back-to-school season. As of Period 34 (Sep 30), lead-time remains stable at 4 periods (P29 order arrived in P33). Demand has stabilized at a high level; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 168.8 units, while the average over the last 10 periods (P24-P33) is 152.8. Given the current date is the end of September, we expect this high-demand regime to persist through the 'Divided Collection' autumn push. On-hand inventory is low (48), but the pipeline is substantial (569). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring base stock levels are responsive to the current ~170 unit weekly volume. L is set to calculated as lead times are consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: average weekly demand over P29-P33 is 168.8 units, maintaining the high-demand level observed since late August.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35 (2019/10/07), we are transitioning from the peak back-to-school/September demand surge into the mid-autumn season for this skinny denim SKU. Demand in Period 34 dropped to 112 units, which is a significant decrease from the previous 5-period average of 168.8 units (P29-P33). However, one week of lower demand is not yet a confirmed regime shift. The 'Carry-over Insights' indicate that since Period 27/28, demand has been very high, averaging around 170 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 134, and units ordered in P31 (121), P32 (146), P33 (104), and P34 (222) are in-transit. To protect against the high demand levels seen throughout September while acknowledging the potential start of a seasonal cooling, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (covering the high-demand peak plus the recent dip) to ensure sufficient stock in the pipeline. Sigma remains high due to recent volatility, so recent_N=5 will also be used for sigma_hat.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn regime, though demand has cooled slightly from the September peak (averaging ~105 units over the last two periods, P34-P35, compared to ~170 in September). This aligns with a typical post-back-to-school stabilization. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P30, P31). Pipeline inventory is high (567 units), and on-hand inventory is 156. My parameter choices reflect the sustained but slightly moderated autumn demand levels. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the average of the last 5 periods (P31-P35: 206, 142, 197, 112, 99 = avg 151.2), which prepares for continued autumn demand while acknowledging the recent dip. Standard deviation is also calculated over this period to account for the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand is stabilizing after the September surge: average weekly demand for P34-P35 dropped to 105.5 units from the late-summer peak of ~170. Lead time remains reliable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450004 (skinny denim) is exhibiting a clear post-peak decline as the September/Early October 'Back-to-School' and 'Autumn' surge subsides. Recent demand for P34-P36 has been 112, 99, and 93, respectively, confirming a stabilization at a lower level (~101 average) compared to the ~170 peak seen in P28-P32. Currently, inventory is healthy with On-hand: 209 and In-transit: 454 (Total Pipeline: 663), while demand is trending downwards toward late October. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent post-peak demand level (avg ~101), and sigma_hat with recent_N=5 (captures the transition into this lower regime) to account for the volatility during the seasonal cooldown. This will prevent over-ordering as we enter late autumn.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-September surge: average weekly demand for P34-P36 dropped to 101.3 units, signaling a transition from the autumn peak to a standard late-autumn level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-95.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Julia RW Skinny Denim has stabilized at a lower level following the high September/early October autumn peak. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand values were 112, 99, 93, and 109, respectively, resulting in a mean of approximately 103 units per period. This shift represents a transition from an average of ~170 during the peak to a standard late-autumn level. Current on-hand inventory is 204 units, with 350 units in-transit (orders from P34, P35, and P36 expected to arrive over the next three periods). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making the target base stock roughly equivalent to the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1). With an average demand of ~103 and L=4, the target pipeline is ~515. Our current total position (on-hand + in-transit) is 554, which is slightly above the current demand trajectory. I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent stabilization and prevent over-ordering as the season cools further.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-September surge: average weekly demand for P34-P37 is 103.3 units, signaling a transition from the autumn peak (avg ~170) to a standard late-autumn level.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Following the September back-to-school peak for this denim SKU, demand has stabilized at a lower, more consistent level. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has been: 112, 99, 93, 109, and 97, resulting in a mean of 102.0 units per period. This confirms the 'post-September surge' regime noted in recent carry-over insights. Total inventory visibility: On-hand is 329, In-transit is 128 (orders from P35 and P36), totaling 457 units. With lead time (L=4) plus current period (L+1=5), and expected demand of ~102/period, the coverage requirement is ~510 units. I am setting L=4 (promised and verified) and mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the contemporary stabilized demand, moving away from the high September averages. This will correctly align inventory with current late-autumn consumption levels while accounting for the high on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized late-autumn: average demand for P34-P38 is 102 units, consistently lower than the early autumn peak (~170 units).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. The demand for Julia RW Skinny Denim has entered a post-autumn stabilizer phase following the high September/October peak. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 94.7 units, with the most recent sample (P39) at 58 units, suggesting a potential further deceleration as we approach late November. On-hand inventory is currently high (366 units), which is more than sufficient to cover immediate demand given the current mean. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (P35 order arrived in P39). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the stabilized late-autumn demand (avg ~95/period). With 366 units on hand and 86 in-transit (Total pipeline: 452), and a target base stock roughly around (1+4)*95 = 475, the system will naturally place a small order or stay flat. Keeping sigma_hat at recent_N=6 to capture the current volatility of this regime.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand stabilization confirmed: average demand for P34-P39 is 94.7 units, reflecting a clear step down from the autumn peak (~170 units).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has consistently stabilized at a lower late-autumn level. For the last 7 periods (P34-P40), weekly demand averaged 90.1 units, representing a significant drop from the September peak (~170 units). Specifically, the last two periods (P39-P40) saw demand of 58 and 63 units, suggesting a potential further softening as winter approaches. Current on-hand inventory is 336 units with 75 units in-transit (P39-P40 orders). Given L=4, the base stock targets coverage for 5 periods. 336 on-hand units alone cover approximately 3.7 periods of demand at the current 90-unit average, or over 5 periods if demand stays near 60. To avoid excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit) while maintaining a safe service level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, P34-P40) to capture the post-peak stabilized mean (~90 units/week). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand stabilization confirmed: Period 34-40 average weekly demand is 90.1 units, reflecting a clear transition from the autumn peak to a lower winter-approaching baseline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (2019/11/25). Historically, demand has cooled significantly from the September/October autumn peak (avg ~170) to a more stable late-autumn level. Over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), the average demand has been approximately 87 units. The most recent three periods (P39-P41) show even lower demand (58, 63, 65, avg ~62), suggesting a further seasonal step-down as winter approaches. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory (On-hand: 271, In-transit: 115) totaling 386 units effectively covers over 6 weeks of demand at the current rate (~62/week). Setting N=8 for mu_hat captures the post-peak stabilization while acknowledging the recent downward trend. Using N=8 for sigma_hat reflects the reduced volatility compared to the high-growth autumn phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime step-down confirmed for late autumn: Period 34-41 average demand is 87 units, with the most recent 3 periods (P39-P41) averaging 62 units, reflecting a clear transition to winter baseline demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/02. Period 42 showed a massive demand spike of 204 units, which is a sharp departure from the recent downward trend (P39-P41 averaged 62 units). This likely signals a Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional event or early holiday shopping surge. The on-hand inventory has dropped to 67 units. In-transit inventory stands at 164 units (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, no arrival is expected to resolve until P44 (from P40 order). This sudden spike requires a significant lift in the base stock to prevent stockouts during the December holiday season. I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture this immediate surge while acknowledging the volatility, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new high-demand state. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Significant seasonal demand spike detected at Period 42 (204 units), likely linked to Black Friday/Cyber Monday. This breaks the previous late-autumn stabilization pattern and signals the start of the December holiday shopping regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in the December holiday season (Dec 9th). Period 42 showed a massive demand spike (204 units), which likely corresponds to Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Period 43 demand dropped back to 46 units, which is typical for the lull between major sales events before the final Christmas rush. Given that this is a denim SKU from the 'Divided' (youth) collection, demand should remain elevated or volatile through the end of December. Historically, we saw lead times remain stable at 4 periods. Our current on-hand is low (74) relative to the potential for holiday spikes, though we have 315 units in-transit (including a large order of 204 from P43). To manage the remaining periods (44-47), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent high volatility (the spike in P42 followed by the drop in P43). This N includes the 204 outlier and the lower winter base, providing a balanced but responsive \u03bc\u0302 to ensure the OR backend maintains sufficient stock for any late-December surge while recognizing the higher variance (\u03c3\u0302).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: Period 42 spike (204) followed by Period 43 drop (46) suggests a high-variance December regime for this denim SKU.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-December (2019/12/16), navigating the post-Black Friday/holiday shopping season. Period 42 saw a massive spike (204 units) followed by two weeks of much lower demand (46 and 43 units). This indicates high volatility typical of December. On-hand inventory is low (53 units), but the pipeline is substantial (377 units), including the large order of 204 units from Period 43 which is expected to arrive in Period 47. Given the current date and recent volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the post-spike stabilization (avg ~97 units) while acknowledging the high sigma. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P39 and P40 orders arrived on time).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the pre-Christmas week (Dec 23). Historical demand for this denim SKU has shown high volatility in December, with a major spike in P42 (204 units, Black Friday) followed by a sharp drop and then a moderate recovery (P43: 46, P44: 43, P45: 74). As the holiday shopping peak concludes and we head into post-Christmas sales and January, demand typically fluctuates before settling. Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods. The carry-over insights correctly identified the December volatility. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) with N=4 to capture the specific December regime (average ~91.75 units/period) while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat) of this period. This ensures we carry enough stock for potential late-holiday surges or early January demand without over-ordering after the peak.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand regime confirmed with high volatility: Period 42-45 demand averaged 91.75 units, including a Black Friday spike of 204 units followed by a lower baseline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the end of December (2019/12/30). Historically, December for this denim SKU has shown high volatility: a massive spike in P42 (204 units, likely Black Friday) followed by a much lower baseline (averaging 52.5 units over P43-P46). Demand for the last 4 weeks (P43-P46) has been: 46, 43, 74, 47. Based on the seasonal transition observed in Jan 2019 (initial samples around 70-80 units), I expect demand to stabilize at a moderate post-holiday baseline as we enter January. The pipeline is currently very high (391 units) due to a large order (204 units) placed in P43 to cover the P42 spike, which should arrive in P47. Given that the lead time is consistently 4 periods, I will set L to 4. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N=4 to capture the post-spike December mean (~52.5) while anticipating the slight rise towards the January baseline of ~75. For sigma_hat, recent_N=5 is used to account for the heightened volatility observed throughout the holiday season (including the P42 spike).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regime (Late December): Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of 52.5 units (P43-P46) following the Black Friday spike, transitioning towards the 2019 January baseline of ~75 units.
