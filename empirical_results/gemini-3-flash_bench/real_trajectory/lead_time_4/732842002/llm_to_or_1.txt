Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for an 'Embrace S.Skinny' denim product. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend from 0 to 121 units over the last 5 weeks, suggesting a ramp-up phase or seasonal demand as we move into February. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no 'conclude' messages yet, I will use the promised lead time of 4. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), the last 3 observations (14, 52, 121) show a clear accelerating trend. Relying on all samples (average ~37.4) would severely under-order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent growth while the backend applies the (1+L) multiplier. Given the high volatility in these early weeks (std dev is significant relative to mean), I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to ensure the buffer reflects the recent surge.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The historical demand data shows a clear upward trend: 0, 0, 14, 52, 121, and most recently 131 in Period 1. This suggests a seasonal ramp-up for denim trousers as we approach spring. The product is 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' (Ladies Denim), which likely has strong spring demand. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (152 units) is still in transit (promised lead time is 4 periods). We lost 131 sales in Period 1 because we started with 0 inventory. To set parameters: 1) L is set to 'default' (4) as we have seen no arrivals to suggest otherwise. 2) mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high demand (121, 131) rather than the earlier zeros. 3) sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the high volatility of this growth phase. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (4+1)=5 periods of demand (~650 units minus in-transit).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. We have zero on-hand inventory and 325 units in-transit (orders from Period 1 and Period 2). Demand has shown a steady upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 0, 0, 14, 52, 121 (pre-game history), and 131, 157 (in-game history). This looks like a product launch or seasonal ramp-up for a 'Ladies Denim' SKU. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive in Period 5 Arrival Resolution (visible in Period 6 START). We are currently experiencing a stockout because the game started with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. To capture the recent demand surge, I will use a 3-period window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using L=default (4 periods) means the backend will look at (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Given the sharp growth from 52 to 157, N=3 ensures we are weighting the triple-digit demand figures more heavily than the earlier zeroes.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a pair of ladies' skinny jeans with denim technology ('Embrace'). Demand has been significant in the first three periods (131, 157, 108), but sales are currently 0 because on-hand inventory is 0 and the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (152 units), Period 2 (173 units), and Period 3 (167 units) are all in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, the first arrival (from Period 1) is expected to occur DURING Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). Demand averages 132 units/period since Feb 11. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this initial active demand regime, and L to default as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods. Total pipeline is 492 units, which is roughly 3.7 periods of demand coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim item (skinny jeans) with a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1, suggesting a high target service level (q \u2248 0.95). In the first 4 periods of the game, on-hand inventory has remained at 0 because the promised lead time (L=4) has not yet elapsed for the first order placed in Period 1. Historical demand samples (including the seed data) show a clear upward trend followed by a peak and a recent decline: 0, 0, 14, 52, 121 (seed), then 131, 157, 108, 73 (game periods). This suggests a mid-winter/early-spring peak (Feb) that is now cooling. Based on the 4-period lead time, the first shipment of 152 units (from Period 1) is expected to arrive during the next period (Period 5), meaning it will be observable at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 665 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4). mu_hat should reflect the recent average demand to avoid over-ordering as demand appears to be decreasing. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the demand regime during the game periods, resulting in a mean of ~117.25 per period. For a lead time of 4, the horizon is 5 periods (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1288.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'super-skinny high-waist denim' jeans, which is a staple item but subject to early spring fashion demand. We have reached Period 6. Based on the history, the first order (placed in Period 1) arrived in Period 5, confirming the actual lead time L=4. Demand peaked in early February (121-157 units) and has since stabilized to a lower level (around 72-73 units) over the last two weeks. We currently have 80 units on hand and 566 in transit. Total pipeline (566 + 80 = 646) is quite high relative to recent demand (72/week). I will use L=4 (promised and confirmed). For demand (mu_hat), I will use the recent 3 periods (P3-P5: 108, 73, 72) to calculate a more conservative forecast (avg ~84), as the initial launch spike appears to have subsided. Sigma_hat will also be calculated using the recent 3 periods to capture this lower but more stable volatility. This approach prevents over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand regime shifted from launch peak (~140) to post-launch stability (~80) starting P4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1607.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 25th. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 and P2 orders arrived in P5 and P6 respectively). Demand shifted from a launch peak (avg ~130 in P1-P2) to a steadier level (avg ~80 in P3-P6). We have 160 on-hand and 393 in-transit (P3: 167, P4: 173, P5: 53, P6: 0). The P3 order (167 units) is expected to arrive this period (P7), and P4 (173 units) in P8, creating a significant inventory build. I am setting L=4, and using the recent 4 periods (P3-P6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the post-launch stabilization (86.5 units/week) rather than the initial stock-out period spikes. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock covering 5 weeks of demand (L+1) while accounting for current pipeline inventory.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), we observe a significant demand spike in Period 7 (317 units), which deviates from the previous 'post-launch stability' of ~80. This spike coincides with the start of spring, suggesting a seasonal shift for 'Ladies Denim' products. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (10 units), and there are 226 units in-transit (173 from Period 4 and 53 from Period 5). The Period 4 order is expected to arrive this period (Period 8). Due to the high demand in Period 7, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this new trend. I will use recent_N=4 for demand to capture the shift from low stability to the recent spike (average of periods 4-7 is ~138). For lead time, I will continue with the confirmed 'default' (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected Period 7 (317 units), likely seasonal (Spring/April) for Ladies Denim/Trousers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3477.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (conclude), we observed demand of 199, following a massive spike of 317 in Period 7. This confirms a seasonal demand shift for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans likely tied to the spring fashion season (late March/early April). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 388 units in transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P6-P8) is (93+317+199)/3 = 203. Since the seasonal peak is active, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this higher mean and volatility. Setting L to 4 reflects the confirmed lead time. The goal is to rebuild stock to meet this elevated seasonal demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak for Ladies Denim confirmed: Average demand periods 7-8 increased to ~258 compared to previous baseline of ~80.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal period (Spring/April) for Ladies Denim. Demand spikes observed in Period 7 (317), Period 8 (199), and Period 9 (118) indicate significant volatility and a sustained upward trend compared to the early March baseline (~80). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 723 units in transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and recent stockouts (Periods 8 and 9), I need to increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this heightened seasonal regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the Period 7-9 spike characteristics while maintaining the lead time 'default' of 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/4/22). History shows a 4-period lead time is consistent (Orders from P1-P5 arrived on schedule). Currently, we are experiencing stockouts because the seasonal demand spike (Ladies Denim, April peak) exceeded available inventory. The last 4 periods (P7-P10) show demand of 317, 199, 118, and 82, averaging 179 units. The drop from 317 to 82 suggests we are past the absolute peak of the spring surge, but demand remains higher than the P4-P5 baseline of 72. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this elevated demand state while accounting for the recent deceleration. L is set to default (4) as lead times have been stable. Mu_hat and Sigma_hat will use the recent 4 periods to inform the base stock calculation, ensuring we cover the lead time plus one review period (5 total periods) based on the current seasonal regime.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak for Ladies Denim peaked in P7 (317) and is currently decelerating as of P10 (82 units). Mean demand for the surge period (P7-P10) is 179 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we have been out of stock for 3 consecutive periods (P10-P12) due to a lead time bottleneck and a seasonal surge that peaked in Period 7. The consistent lead time of 4 periods suggests the order from Period 8 (335 units) will arrive during Period 12, followed by 388 units in Period 13. Demand is currently stabilizing following the spring peak, with the last two periods (P10-P11) averaging 99.5 units. However, we must account for the high volatility seen during the April surge. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent deceleration and the tail end of the high-demand period (avg ~166 per week). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to maintain a high safety stock buffer given recent demand swings (std ~95). This configuration should help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) as stock finally begins to arrive.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak for Ladies Denim between late March and mid-April (Periods 7-9: 317, 199, 118 units). Since Period 10, demand has stabilized at a lower level (Period 10-12: 82, 117, 107 units), averaging 102 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (Period 8 order arrived in Period 12). Period 11 and 12 had orders of 180 and 0 respectively; Period 10's order of 376 is expected in Period 14. We currently have 228 on-hand and 944 in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11). Given the post-peak stabilization, I will use recent_N (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable demand observed in P10-P12, ensuring we don't over-order as the seasonal surge dissipates.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-seasonal peak: Periods 10-12 average demand is ~102 units, down from the surge peak of ~211 units (P7-P9).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842002' (Ladies Denim) has stabilized following a seasonal spring peak. The mean demand over the last four periods (P10-P13) is 94.25 units (82, 117, 107, 71), showing a clear deceleration from the April surge. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on arrivals in P12 (ordered P8) and P13 (ordered P9). On-hand inventory is 545 units following the arrival of the large P9 order (388 units). Pipeline inventory stands at 556 units (orders from P10 and P11). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 1,101 units, which covers over 11 weeks of current demand. Given the lead time L=4, the backend will target covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current stable mean (~94 units/week), required base stock is roughly 470-500 units. Since current position (1,101) significantly exceeds this, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' where N=4 to reflect the current post-peak stability, and L=4 is maintained as 'default'.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stability confirmed: Periods 10-13 average demand is 94.25 units, down from the seasonal surge average of 211 (P7-P9).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear seasonal peak in late March/early April (P7-P8) that has since subsided. The demand for the last five periods (P10-P14) has stabilized with an average of 94.6 units per period (82, 117, 107, 71, 96). Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 825 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the expected demand for the next 5 periods (review period + lead time of 4). Specifically, (1+L)*mu_hat \u2248 5 * 95 = 475 units. Since on-hand (825) already exceeds base stock requirements, the OR backend's capped policy will correctly result in 0 new orders to avoid incurring further holding costs. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the stable post-peak regime (N=5) to avoid over-ordering based on the past seasonal spike.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842002' (Ladies Denim) is in a post-seasonal stability phase following a spike in late March/early April. Current date is 2019/5/27. Over the last 6 periods (P10-P15), demand has remained consistently low, averaging 94.17 units (82, 117, 107, 71, 96, 92). Inventory is currently very high (913 units on-hand) due to the arrival of orders placed during the peak period (P8-P11). With in-transit at 0 and on-hand sufficient to cover over 9 weeks of current average demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect this stabilized lower demand regime, allowing the OR engine to wind down inventory levels naturally.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stability confirmed for 6 consecutive periods (P10-P15): Mean demand 94.2 units, significantly lower than the P7-P9 seasonal surge of 211 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for the last 7 periods (P10-P16) has stabilized following a seasonal peak in late March/early April. The average demand during this post-peak period is 97.4 units (82, 117, 107, 71, 96, 92, 117), which is significantly lower than the P7-P9 surge. On-hand inventory is high at 796 units, providing roughly 8 periods of cover at current sales rates. No shipments are in-transit as orders were paused while inventory cleared. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P1-P5, P2-P6, etc.). Given the high inventory, the priority remains avoiding further holding costs until stock levels drop closer to a 5-period cover (approx 500 units). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 specifically targets this stabilized demand regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak regime after the April/May seasonal surge for Ladies Denim. For the past 8 periods (P10-P17), demand has averaged approximately 94.6 units, showing no signs of returning to the peak levels observed in P7-P9. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently very high (721 units) because large orders placed during the seasonal peak (P8-P11) have arrived while demand was decelerating. This on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 7.6 periods of demand at the current average rate of ~95 units/period. Since the pipeline inventory is 0 and the current inventory exceeds the needed base stock for (L+1) = 5 periods, the OR backend will correctly order 0 units. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the stable post-peak demand mean and volatility for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, and keep L at default (4).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842002' (Ladies Denim Trousers) has fully transitioned from its spring peak (late March/April) into a stable post-peak demand phase. For the last 9 periods (P10-P18), the mean demand has been 91.1 units. The most recent three periods (P16-P18) show a slight cooling with demand at 117, 75, and 63 units, respectively (average 85). On-hand inventory is currently high at 658 units, with zero in-transit shipments remaining. Given the lead time of 4 periods and a consumption rate of ~91 units per period, the current stock covers approximately 7 periods of demand, which is more than the pipeline target of (L+1) = 5 periods. Therefore, the OR backend will naturally suppress ordering. I am maintaining L at 'default' (4) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture this entire post-peak stability regime accurately, ensuring we don't over-order as inventory gradually depletes.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stability confirmed for 9 consecutive periods (P10-P18): Mean demand 91.1 units, down from the seasonal surge average (P7-P9) of 211 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (Embrace Super Skinny Jeans) has exited its spring seasonal peak (P7-P9) and is now in a stable post-peak phase. Since Period 10, demand has consistently averaged around 90-100 units per week. Inventory levels are currently very high (602 units on-hand) due to large orders placed during the seasonal surge arriving just as demand began to cool. Given the current on-hand inventory and the observed demand trend (last 4 weeks: 117, 75, 63, 56), the existing stock covers approximately 6-8 periods of demand. No new orders are necessary. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Settings mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect the stabilized demand regime (P10-P19) and prevent over-ordering while the system works through existing stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842002' (Ladies Denim Trousers) has entered a period of lower demand following its seasonal spring peak. The 'Post-peak demand stability' regime, which began around Period 10 (mid-April), continues to show a gradual downward trend. In the most recent four periods (P17-P20), demand has averaged 54.5 units per week (75, 63, 56, 24), which is significantly lower than the P10-P16 average of approximately 97. The most recent demand of 24 units in P20 suggests a potential further deceleration or seasonal low as of early July. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 578 units with no units in transit. Given the current average demand of ~55 (recent_4), this stock covers over 10 periods, far exceeding the 5-period requirement (L+1). To avoid excessive holding costs, I will keep mu_hat and sigma_hat aligned with the recent stable-to-declining regime. No new orders are expected to be generated by the OR backend given the high inventory safety margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Average weekly demand decreased from ~94 (P10-16) to ~55 (P17-20). Total stock (578) remains excessive for current demand levels.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans continues its downward trend as we move further into the summer season. P21 observed a demand of 41 units, following P20's 24 units. The average demand for the last five periods (P17-P21) is 51.8 units, confirming a significant drop from the post-peak stability phase (which averaged ~91). Current on-hand inventory is 537 units, which covers over 10 periods of current demand levels. There is no pipeline inventory (in-transit is 0). Because the current stock drastically exceeds the required base stock even for a lead time of 4, the OR backend will naturally order 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect this lower demand regime (P17-P21) and L to default as the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: Average demand decreased to ~52 units/week (P17-P21) as summer seasonality likely reduces interest in heavy denim/trousers.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842002' (Ladies Denim) is in a significant demand downturn as of mid-July (Period 23), likely due to summer seasonality. Demand has dropped from a peak average of ~211 (P7-P9) to a stable post-peak of ~94 (P10-P16), and most recently to a low-regime average of ~51 units/week (P17-P22). With 492 units currently on-hand and an average weekly demand of ~51, the current stock represents approximately 9-10 weeks of supply. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory level, no new orders are necessary. The priority remains to bleed off the excess inventory to minimize holding costs, which are currently high relative to the low demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the current low-demand regime (P17-P22).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: Average demand decreased to ~51 units/week (P17-P22). This represents a 45% decrease from the previous stability level (~94) and a 75% decrease from the seasonal peak (~211).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ladies Denim' (732842002) has consistently declined since Period 17, reflecting summer seasonality. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P17-P23) is approximately 49.1 units per week. With an on-hand inventory of 452 units and zero in-transit shipments, the stock level covers roughly 9 weeks of future demand at this current rate. Given the promised lead time (L=4) plus the current review period (L+1=5), the required base stock (approx. 5 * 50 = 250 units) is far below our current on-hand inventory. No new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (N=7) and continue using the observed lead time (L=4).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Ladies Denim Trousers' continues to decline as the summer season progresses, with the most recent demand (P24) dropping to 17 units. A low-demand regime has been clearly established since Period 17. The average demand for the last 8 periods (P17-P24) is approximately 45.1 units per week. With an on-hand inventory of 435 units and no incoming shipments, the stock level is sufficient for nearly 10 weeks of supply at the current consumption rate. My objective is to maintain zero new orders to allow the high holding cost to be mitigated by natural depletion. I will use a recent_N (N=8) method to reflect this current low-demand stability (P17-P24) while keeping the lead time at the promised 4 periods, as no deviations have been observed lately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 sustained for 8 periods (P17-P24): Mean demand dropped to ~45 units/week from previous stability of ~94. Recent P24 demand (17) suggests further tapering as summer continues.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. We are observing a significant and sustained demand decline for SKU 732842002 (Ladies Super Skinny Jeans), which likely corresponds to late summer seasonality. Since Period 17, demand has shifted from an average of ~94 to ~45 units/week. The most recent demand (P21-P25) averages 41.6 units/week. With an on-hand inventory of 370 units and zero in-transit, we currently hold over 8 weeks of stock at the current demand rate. The OR backend's goal is to prevent ordering while inventory is high and holding costs are accumulating. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (last 9 periods, P17-P25) to align the base stock calculation with the current low-demand reality. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 firmly established for 9 periods: Mean demand 47.3 units/week (P17-P25), vs previous stability of ~91 (P10-P18). Inventory levels remain high relative to current demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans continues to sit in a low-demand regime throughout the summer. Since Period 17, demand has stabilized at an average of roughly 47 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 298 units, which, at the recent average demand rate, covers over 6 weeks of supply. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and a service level target (based on $19 profit / $1 holding cost) that suggests holding enough for (L+1) periods plus safety stock, the current stock level is still significantly higher than the required base stock (~235-250 units). Therefore, no new order is necessary. I will continue using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this sustained lower demand regime (P17-P26), and 'default' for other parameters to allow the backend to use standard calculations while pipeline inventory is depleted.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand showing for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans indicates a potential recovery or shift in the trend. After a prolonged summer slump (P17-P24 avg ~45), demand has increased for three consecutive weeks: 65, 72, and 101 (P25-P27). This suggests the late August 'back-to-school' or early autumn transition is starting, where interest in denim typically rebounds. The average demand for these last three periods is 79.3 units. Given the 197 units on-hand and 153 in-transit (ordered P27, expected P31), we have 350 total units to cover current and future demand. To avoid over-ordering while respecting the increasing trend, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P23-P27) to capture this upward movement while smoothing out the very low P24. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The parameters will target a base stock level that accommodates the rising demand while utilizing existing high inventory to mitigate holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend detected: Demand increased for three consecutive weeks (P25-P27: 65, 72, 101) after the summer low, averaging ~79 units compared to the previous 8-week average of ~45.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26). Demand has shown a clear recovery trend over the last four periods (P25-P28: 65, 72, 101, 77), averaging 78.75 units/week. This follows a summer low of ~45 units/week and likely signals the start of the 'Back to School' or Autumn season for Ladies Denim. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 120 and 216 units in-transit (ordered P27 and P28), the pipeline is starting to fill. However, to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) at the new demand level of ~79 units/week (total need ~395), additional ordering is required to bridge the gap (395 - 336 = 59). I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward trend while ignoring the summer trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Average demand for P25-P28 increased to 78.8 units/week, up from the summer low of ~45 (P17-P24). This likely represents Autumn seasonality for denim.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ladies Denim Trousers' has transitioned out of the summer low (~45 units/week) into an Autumn recovery phase (P25-P29 average: 76.2 units/week). Period 29 demand (66) slightly decelerated from the P27 peak (101), but the overall trend is upwards compared to July. On-hand inventory is now low (54), and while there is 321 units in-transit (ordered P27-P29), the first of these orders (from P27) is not expected until Period 31 (L=4). Therefore, I must ensure the base stock levels cover the current demand regime. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recovery average (approx 76.2 * 5 = 381 units for L+1). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' at its confirmed 4-period level.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the Autumn/September period (Period 31, Date: 2019/9/9). Historical data shows a clear recovery from the summer low (which averaged ~45 units). Demand from Period 25 to Period 30 has averaged 78.2 units, indicating a stable Autumn trend. However, the system is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) as of the start of Period 31, and demand in Period 30 was 88 units. Orders placed in P27 onwards are still in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the P27 order (153 units) is expected to arrive during Period 31 (visible in Period 32). The current in-transit pipeline (382 units) consists of orders from P27 (153), P28 (63), P29 (105), and P30 (61). These should satisfy the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the Autumn recovery (P25-P30) which averages ~78 units per week. Lead time L is stable at 4.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ladies Denim' is currently in an Autumn recovery phase, exiting the summer lows (P17-P24). Over the last seven periods (P25-P31), demand has stabilized at a new mean of approximately 76.3 units/week (65, 72, 101, 77, 66, 88, 65). This is a significant improvement over the summer average of ~45, but lower than the spring peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P27 order arrived P31). We are currently in Period 32. Total inventory (On-hand: 88 + In-transit: 290 = 378) is substantial relative to the current demand mean, providing roughly 5 weeks of coverage. However, the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent over-ordering if we maintain a realistic mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this post-summer recovery regime (76.3 * 5 = 381.5), and use a recent_N sigma to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime established (P25-P31): Mean demand stabilized at 76.3 units/week, up from the summer low of 45 units/week.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn demand regime (post-September equinox). Since Period 25, demand has stabilized around an average of ~73 units per week (P25-P32), which is a recovery from the summer low (~45). The most recent demand (47) is lower than the regime average, but the overall trend since August supports a higher mean than the summer period. Inventory management is now normalized after clearing the massive overstock from P13-P27. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P31 and P32 arrivals). I will use recent_N with N=8 (since P25) to capture this Autumn demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L to maintain the promised/observed lead time of 4.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. We are in the Autumn demand regime for Ladies Denim, which stabilized around Period 25. The mean demand from Period 25 to Period 33 is 75.3 units/week (65, 72, 101, 77, 66, 88, 65, 47, 96). While there is some volatility, the demand is significantly higher than the summer low of ~45. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 113, and there are 215 units in-transit (ordered P30-P33), totaling 328 units. With a lead time of 4, our base stock must cover (L+1) = 5 weeks of demand. 5 * 75.3 = 376.5 units. Current total inventory (328) is slightly below this target. I will use the established Autumn regime (recent_N=9) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a level that maintains service while accounting for the recent demand stabilization.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans is currently in an Autumn stability phase (October). Since Period 25 (the start of the Autumn season), demand has averaged 74.2 units per week (P25-P34). Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), the mean demand is slightly lower at 67.6 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P31, P32, P33, and P34). On-hand inventory is 112, and in-transit is 258. Total pipeline plus on-hand is 370 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate (74.2 * 5 = 371). Given the current status and the need to maintain stock for the lead time + review period (L=4, so 5 periods total), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the Autumn trend since Period 25, while maintaining stability in the sigma_hat estimation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $627.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P32-P35) averages 61.25 units, showing a slight softening from the Autumn peak of ~76 units, but remaining well above the summer low of 45. The 'Autumn' regime appears stable though volatile (demand: 47, 96, 62, 40). Inventory management is currently balanced with On-hand (133) and In-transit (259) totaling 392 units, which covers roughly 6.4 periods of recent average demand. Promised lead time (4) remains reliable as evidenced by arrivals in P31-P35 perfectly matching the orders from P27-P31. I will use a 5-period window (P31-P35) for demand forecasting to capture the current stabilization while acknowledging the recent dip. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate. mu_hat will be estimated from the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the shift towards ~60 units/week. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the recurring volatility in this denim category.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand stabilization: Average demand for P31-P35 is 60.8 units, reflecting a moderate decrease from the initial autumn recovery (~76) but remaining stable compared to summer levels.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for this Ladies Denim SKU has settled into a stable Autumn/Winter pattern following the summer lows and subsequent early Autumn recovery. Over the last six periods (P31-P36), demand has averaged 59.8 units (65, 47, 96, 62, 40, 49). Current on-hand inventory is 138 units, and in-transit is 205 (orders from P33, P34, P35). Total pipeline is 343 units. Given a lead time (L) of 4, the total pipeline must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current mean (~60 units), 5 periods of demand equals approximately 300 units. Since current pipeline (343) already exceeds this, and there is a holding cost of $1/unit/period vs $19 profit, keeping inventory lean is preferable. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current stabilized regime, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans is currently in an Autumn/Winter stabilization phase. Over the last 7 periods (P31-P37), demand has averaged 60.4 units/week, which is slightly lower than the initial Autumn recovery (~76) but demonstrates stability. The current on-hand inventory is 113 units, and there are 196 units in-transit (ordered in P34, P35, and P37). Given a lead time of 4 periods, we expect arrivals to continue smoothly. To maintain a lean inventory while ensuring sufficient service level (q = 0.95), I will base mu_hat on the most recent 7-week stabilized regime (N=7). This uses local mean demand to avoid over-ordering based on the earlier Autumn peak or under-ordering based on the summer low. The pipeline is currently healthy, covering nearly 3 weeks of demand, so the OR backend will likely recommend a smaller order to maintain the base stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 732842002 is in an Autumn/Winter demand phase. Since the end of the Autumn recovery (approx. Period 31), demand has stabilized at a lower level. Average demand from Period 31 to 38 is 59.1 units. The current on-hand inventory is 169 units, and in-transit inventory is 153 units (ordered in Periods 35, 37, 38). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With high pipeline inventory relative to recent demand (mean ~60), the goal is to maintain sufficient stock for the (L+1) window without over-ordering as we move further into Q4. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P31-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Ladies Denim Trousers) has significantly declined in the last period (18 units) and has been trending lower over the past five periods (mean of ~44 units compared to the previous stability of ~61). This likely reflects a pre-holiday lull or end-of-season tapering for this specific 'raw-edge' denim style. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (213) plus in-transit (129) totals 342, which is very high relative to the recent demand mean (~44). I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this most recent downward shift in demand, which will result in the OR backend placing smaller or zero orders to drain the existing surplus inventory and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Demand decreased from Autumn stability (~61) to late Autumn/Winter low (mean ~44, P35-P39), with P39 dropping to 18 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has shifted to a late Autumn/Winter low, with the average demand over the last 6 periods (P35-P40) being 41.0 units, significantly down from the earlier Autumn average of ~76. The last two periods (P39-P40) show even lower demand (18 and 27 units). With 186 units on-hand and 129 units in-transit (total pipeline of 315), the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods) at the current rate (~41 * 5 = 205). There are no pending arrivals for P41 (P36 order was 0), so on-hand will decrease naturally. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (N=6) to avoid further overstocking during this slow period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 35: Mean demand decreased to 41.0 units/week (P35-P40) from the previous Autumn stability of ~61 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' (Ladies Denim) has entered a late-season low. Since Period 35, the average demand has decreased to approximately 41 units per week, with recent demand remaining low at 33 units. This downward trend is consistent with winter seasonality for this specific style. With on-hand inventory at 183 units and 99 units in-transit (due to arrive over the next few periods), the total pipeline of 282 units is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 6 weeks of the game at the current consumption rate of ~41 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (P35-P41) to capture this lower volume regime precisely, which will result in no new orders being placed to avoid unnecessary holding costs as the game nears conclusion.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 732842002 (Ladies Denim) is currently in a late Autumn/Winter low-demand regime, which was confirmed starting Period 35. Over the last 8 periods (P35-P42), mean demand is 42.6 units. The most recent demand in P42 spiked to 62, but given the late-year seasonality (December 2nd) and the previous multi-week trend of lower demand (18-33 units), I will maintain a conservative forecast. On-hand inventory is high at 182 units, and there is an in-transit shipment of 38 units (ordered P39, expected P43). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and a service level target based on a 19:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, current total stock (220) is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand at the current mean. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the late Autumn/Winter regime (P35-P42). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Demand remains in a lower-volume regime that started around Period 35. The mean demand for the last 9 periods (P35-P43) is 40.4 units. On-hand inventory is 197 units, which is quite high (nearly 5 weeks of coverage). There is a small in-transit quantity of 53 units scheduled to arrive in P47 (ordered in P43). Given that the game ends at Period 47, any order placed now (P44) with a lead time of 4 periods would arrive at the conclusion of P48, which is outside the game horizon. Therefore, the parameter setup should focus on minimizing further ordering while maintaining current stock. I will use the established low-demand mean (approx 40) to inform mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to reflect the late-year slowdown. The OR backend will likely zero out orders anyway due to high on-hand levels and the proximity to the game's end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $423.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019/12/16). Demand for Ladies Denim has shifted to a lower Winter regime since Period 35. Average demand from Period 35 to Period 44 is approximately 39.5 units per week, with recent demand showing slight fluctuations but remaining below the Autumn levels. On-hand inventory is 166 units, and there are 67 units in-transit (53 from P43 and 14 from P44). Given that the mean demand for the lead time plus review period (5 weeks) is approximately 198 units (39.5 * 5), the total pipeline inventory (166 + 67 = 233) is already sufficient to cover expected demand at a high service level until the end of the simulation (only 3 periods remain after this decision). No order was placed in Period 41 or 42 because inventory levels were already high. I will set L to its default of 4 and use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current winter demand regime (P35-P44). This will result in a base stock level that prevents excessive holding costs as we reach the final weeks.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019 (Period 46). We are in a low-demand winter regime. Since Period 35, demand has averaged approximately 38.6 units per week (P35-P45), significantly lower than the autumn peak. Most recently, the average over the last 6 periods (P40-P45) is 35.3 units. I will use recent_N=6 to reflect this current stabilized low demand. On-hand inventory is 130, and in-transit is 90 (P43: 53, P44: 14, P45: 23). Total pipeline + on-hand is 220 units. With an lead time of 4, the base stock target (covering 5 periods) at an average of ~36 units/week would be around 180 units. Since 220 > 180, the OR backend is expected to place a minimal or zero order to bleed off excess inventory and avoid further holding costs during this slow period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' super-skinny jeans. Demand has been in a low-seasonal regime (late Autumn/Winter) since Period 35, with mean demand of approximately 41 units. However, looking at the most recent 6 periods (P41-P46), demand has averaged approximately 37.1 units, showing continued stability at this lower level. The actual lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P37, P38, and P39). There are in-transit orders from P43 (53 units), P44 (14 units), P45 (23 units), and P46 (8 units), totaling 98 units. On-hand inventory is 92 units. For Period 47, I will use recent_N (N=12) to capture the demand regime since Period 35, which provides a stable mean for the current winter low. This balances the risk of overstocking during a period of low seasonal interest for denim while maintaining enough buffer for the lead time (L=4, covering demand for 5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Winter demand stability confirmed: Average demand for P35-P46 is 39.3 units, representing a sustained seasonal low for this SKU.
