Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks'. Initial on-hand and in-transit are zero. The primary challenge is the promised lead time of 4 periods, meaning we must cover demand for approximately 5 periods (L+1) to reach a steady state. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) show values of [77, 59, 67, 78, 112]. There is a noticeable uptick in the most recent sample (112), which might indicate an early seasonal shift or a specific promotion. The mean of the history is 78.6. Given the promised lead time of 4, the default mu_hat calculation (1+4)*78.6 = 393. Since this is the first decision period and we have no observed arrivals or lead-time data, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand distribution accurately.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is women's trainer socks. Historical demand shows a significant jump: average demand for Jan was ~70, but Feb 4 was 112, and Period 1 (Feb 11) was 142. This suggests a seasonal uptick or regime shift as we approach spring. The on-hand inventory is 0, units were lost to stockout in Period 1 (demand 142 vs 0 on-hand), and 112 units are currently in-transit (ordered in Period 1). With a promised lead time of 4, these units won't arrive until Period 5. Based on the last 2 samples (112, 142), the mean demand is 127. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this higher demand level for the expected (L+1) period window to ensure the OR backend orders enough to recover from the stockout.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is women's trainer socks. Historical data from Jan/early Feb showed demand between 59-112. However, Period 1 demand was 142 and Period 2 demand spiked significantly to 311. This spike correlates with late February, possibly reflecting a transition to spring/activewear or a specific promotion. Demand has shifted from an average of ~78 to a much higher regime. With on-hand inventory at 0 and cumulative demand of 453 units missed so far, the system is in a stockout. Promised lead time is 4 periods; we placed orders in P1 (112) and P2 (164), totaling 276 in-transit, but these won't arrive until P5/P6. Given the recent demand surge (311 in P2), I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to weight the forecast toward this new high-demand regime. This will increase mu_hat to ensure the base stock level (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is sufficient to meet this elevated demand and recover from the stockout once shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 2: demand increased from ~80 to 311 (+280%). Monitor for persistence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is women's fine-knit trainer socks. Historical demand samples (Early Jan-Early Feb) averaged ~78 units. However, starting Period 2 (Feb 18), demand spiked significantly to 311 and 293 in Period 3, representing a +280% regime shift likely driven by seasonal transition into spring where trainer socks see high demand. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 700 units in-transit. Promised lead time is 4 periods; therefore, the first order (placed Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at Period 6 start). Because we have not yet observed any 'conclude' arrival messages, we cannot confirm actual lead time, so we stick to the 'default' (promised). For demand forecasting, I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the new high-demand regime (avg ~302) while ignoring the lower historical baseline, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for (1+L) = 5 periods of this higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 2 confirmed: avg increased from ~78 to ~302 (+287%) likely due to seasonal spring shift for trainer socks.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which explains the demand surge observed since Period 2 as spring begins. Previous demand (Jan to early Feb) averaged ~78, but the last three periods (P2-P4) have averaged ~269. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (112 units) should arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and be visible in Period 6's status. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost sales in every period so far, it is critical to keep the pipeline full to meet the new higher demand regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility. I will maintain the default lead time (4) as we have not yet reached the point where the first order should have arrived.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees a seasonal surge in spring. Demand history shows a clear regime shift from ~70 units (pre-Feb) to an average of ~230 units (Periods 2-5). The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first arrival (112 units) was immediately consumed by the demand (201 units). With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Period 5 concluded with 1,276 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), totaling 1,276 units. Based on a 4-period moving average of demand (approx 252 units/period), we require a base stock of roughly 1,260 units. However, to account for the sustained higher demand mean (approx 300 in the earlier part of the shift) and seasonal momentum for trainer socks in March, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher demand regime while allowing the OR backend to calculate the safety stock based on the volatility of these recent observations.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). High demand regime (avg ~252) persists into March, correlating with seasonal trainer sock demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late March (2019/3/25), entering peak season for 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical demand from P2 onwards shows a high-demand regime averaging approx 250 units/period (311, 293, 203, 201, 239), a significant jump from the early 70-80 range. Current on-hand inventory is 0 despite arrivals, as demand (approx 239) is outstripping previous smaller orders (e.g., P2 arrived 164 units). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P2 order arrived P6). I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma estimation to capture the current high-demand regime accurately.mu_hat will target (1+L)*~250 = 1250 units for the coverage period. Service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, which the OR engine will use to manage stockouts.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (April 1). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Demand since Period 2 has averaged 267 units/period, significantly higher than the initial baseline. In Period 7, demand spiked to 354, and we finally have a positive ending inventory of 70 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (arrived Period 5, 6, and 7 all show 4-period lead times). Currently, there are 1010 units in transit (ordered P4, P5, P6, P7). Total pipeline inventory (70 on-hand + 1010 in-transit) is 1080 units. With L=4, we need coverage for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the recent demand average (~267), expected demand over 5 periods is 1335. I will set mu_hat based on the high-demand regime (last 6 periods from P2 to P7) to ensure the OR backend aims for sufficient stock to cover this seasonal peak and reduce lost sales.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (early April). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees high demand in spring (Feb-May). Historical demand patterns show a shift from an average of ~80 in Jan to a high-demand regime averaging ~288 since mid-Feb (Period 2-8). Specifically, the last two periods (Period 7-8) showed a further spike to 354 and 385. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (based on concludes from P5-P8). Current on-hand is low (8 units), but we have 1057 units in-transit, including orders from P5 (365 units), P6 (199 units), P7 (123 units), and P8 (370 units). Since lead time is stable at 4, P5 delivery is expected in P9's arrival phase. I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand mean to capture the sustained high-demand regime since mid-February, and calculate for lead time as the 4-period promised lead time is holding true.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further intensified in late March/early April: Avg demand since Period 7 is 369.5, compared to 252 for early March. Trainer sock seasonality is in full peak.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which has entered a sustained high-demand spring/summer seasonal peak in April. Current demand is averaging around 340 units over the last three periods (Periods 7-9: 354, 385, 282), representing a significant increase from early March (avg ~215). The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods, which means we must plan for a 5-period horizon (L+1). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand and sigma estimation to capture this intensified peak regime, setting L to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time reliably. The ending inventory of 91 units and 1095 units in-transit provide a baseline, but the OR backend needs these parameters to maintain a target stock of ~1,700 units (340 * 5) to avoid stockouts during this high-demand period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22. The product is trainer socks, which are in peak seasonal demand. In Period 10, we experienced a stockout (sold 290 with demand of 382), ending with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand regime has shifted upwards in late March/April. Over the last 4 periods (P7-P10), demand values were 354, 385, 282, 382, averaging 350.75 per period. Since L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat captures this current peak regime (approx 1753.75 total). Explicit sigma is set to 50 to handle the observed volatility in this peak window. Given we have 0 on-hand and high pipeline inventory (1324), we rely on the backend OR logic to maintain the base stock level required for the next 5 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 12 (late April), looking at a peak seasonal item (fine-knit trainer socks). Demand has surged significantly; the most recent demand (Period 11) reached 472 units, and the average over the last 5 periods (Periods 7-11) is 375 units, compared to the earlier March average of ~252. We are currently out of stock (on-hand = 0), though 1,589 units are in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P7 arrived P11). Given the high demand and stockout risk during this peak season, I will use a recent demand window (N=5) to capture the current high-velocity regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the latest 375+ unit demand levels rather than the lower historical average, aiming to improve service level while acknowledging lead-time constraints.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak sustained: April demand average (Periods 8-11) reached 380 units, reflecting full trainer sock seasonality. Stockouts occurred in Periods 10 and 11 due to demand exceeding recent arrivals.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and the product is 'fine-knit trainer socks', which is in its peak seasonal window. Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift starting in early March (Period 4), with a further intensification in April. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 393.4 units, significantly higher than the early season. We have experienced stockouts in Periods 10, 11, and 12 because historical orders (placed during lower demand periods) were insufficient. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current demand is the most relevant for the peak season, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this high-demand plateau (avg ~393) and setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the high volatility (std dev ~74) seen during this surge. Our Pipeline consists of 1707 units, and with L=4, we are aiming for a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (approx 1967 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at peak levels during April/May: avg demand for P8-P12 is 393.4. Volatility has also increased during this period.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Demand for fine-knit trainer socks remains in its seasonal peak. Although Period 13 demand (261) was lower than the April average (~380-400), demand can be volatile during peak season, as seen in Period 11 (472). I need to ensure sufficient stock to cover the expected demand over the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (L+1=5). Based on recent evidence from Periods 8-13 (average demand ~371), I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods since Period 5, so I will maintain the default lead time setting. sigma_hat will also be set based on the recent window to account for increased volatility during the peak season.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late May (Period 15). The product (fine-knit trainer socks) is in its peak seasonal window. Recent demand has stabilized but remains higher than the early-year baseline. The most recent demand figures (Period 13: 261, Period 14: 288) suggest a slight cooling or stabilization from the April peak (averaging ~380-400), but remain volatile. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. My pipeline inventory is high (1597 units), so I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (covering the April/May period) to ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock that accounts for both the peak levels and the recent slight dip. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to capture the increased volatility seen during the seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in May: average demand for Periods 11-14 is 376.25, showing high variance compared to the April peak. Trainer sock seasonality remains active.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the demand for 'fine-knit trainer socks' remains in its high seasonal plateau. Analyzing the most recent period block (Periods 11-15), the demand average is approximately 363 units with significant variance (StDev ~84). Lead times have been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 15 conclusion where the Period 11 order arrived). The current on-hand inventory is 320 units, and the pipeline is robust with 1433 units in transit. To maintain the target service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (approx 95% service level), I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the current plateau, as demand has slightly moderated from the peak seen in late April (P11-P12) but remains high compared to the early season.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. We are managing 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which have exhibited strong seasonality throughout spring. Demand peaked in late April and has since stabilized in May. The average demand for the most recent period (P13-P16) is approximately 319.5 units, which is a slight decrease from the April peak (~380 units), suggesting we may be past the absolute peak but still in a high-demand period for the summer. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by the last 12 arrivals). Current on-hand inventory is 429 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 1350 units. To avoid overstocking as we potentially exit peak seasonality while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering May demand) to capture the current stabilized demand levels. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May: average demand for Periods 13-16 is 319.5 units, slightly lower than the April peak of ~380, indicating a potential post-peak summer plateau for trainer socks.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which experienced a significant seasonal peak in April/May (~380 units/period) and is now entering a summer plateau. For the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has moderated slightly, averaging 309.2 units (261, 288, 350, 379, 268), which is lower than the April peak but still high compared to the pre-peak period. On-hand inventory is healthy at 675 units, and 1048 units are in transit (including P14, P15, P16, P17 orders). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the slight cooling from the peak, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and variance to capture the most recent regime shift (post-peak plateau) and avoid over-ordering as seasonality potentially tapers off further into summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in early June: Average demand for Periods 13-17 is 309.2 units, confirming a plateau below the April peak of ~380.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 372860002 (trainer socks) shows clear seasonality: demand surged in late February, peaked in April/early May (reaching averages of ~390), and has stabilized in June. The average demand over the last 6 periods (Periods 13-18) is 305.3. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The inventory position is currently strong with 596 units on-hand and 857 in-transit, which covers more than 4 periods of the current average demand. Setting L to default (4) and using a recent 6-period window for mu_hat (N=6) captures the current post-peak plateau (avg ~305) better than the long-term mean or the April peak. Applying recent_N to sigma_hat (N=6) accounts for the current volatility in the summer plateau regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical demand for the last few periods (P15-P19) has been 350, 379, 268, 286, and 458, which averages to 348.2 units. This indicates that while the April peak (avg ~380) has passed, demand for trainer socks remains robust during the summer months, though volatile. The 'in-transit' inventory is 883 units, consisting of orders from P16 (405), P17 (212), P18 (16), and P19 (250). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 362. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 captures the current summer plateau and its recent volatility (standard deviation remains significant). Setting N=5 focuses on the most relevant recent regime (post-May) while managing the pipeline to avoid excessive holding costs as we move further into summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in June: average demand for Periods 15-19 is 348.2 units, confirming a robust summer plateau despite increased week-to-week volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product SKU 372860002 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a sustained summer high-demand phase. The current date is July 1st, 2019. Historical demand since mid-June (Periods 19-20) has shown a significant uptick (458 and 405 units), compared to the late May plateau of ~310 units. The 5-period average (P16-P20) is 359.2 units, with increased volatility (std dev ~71). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 362 units, with 952 units in-transit (orders from P17-P20). To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am using a recent_N window of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand volatility, and calculate for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak intensified in late June/early July: average demand for Periods 19-20 rose to 431.5 units, significantly higher than the early June plateau (309.2 units). Trainer sock demand remains very strong mid-summer.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', currently in its peak summer season (July). The Carry-Over Insights and historical demand indicate a significant intensification of demand since late June (Period 19), with recent demand figures of 458, 405, and 356 (average ~406). The summer plateau previously identified around 310-340 units has shifted upward to a higher level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 218 and total pipeline inventory at 1232, we must ensure the base stock levels are high enough to cover the remaining summer peak. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and standard deviation to capture this specific late-June/early-July intensification. This provides a mu_hat calculation based on (1+4) * mean(458, 405, 356), which is approximately 2030 units, ensuring sufficient stock for the (L+1) period horizon while recognizing the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak intensified in late June/early July: average demand for Periods 19-21 is 406.3 units, signaling a higher seasonal peak than the 309-348 units seen in early June.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', currently in its peak summer season (mid-July). Period 22 concluded with a stockout (on-hand: 0) because the arriving shipment (from Period 18) was only 16 units, while demand remained high at 354 units. The summer peak identified in periods 19-21 (average ~406 units) dropped slightly to 354 in Period 22, but remains well above the early June plateau. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current summer demand regime (average ~393 units) while accounting for the high volatility observed in recently concluded periods (20-22). This will set 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to levels that prevent further stockouts during this high-demand summer window.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late July, a peak period for fine-knit trainer socks. The demand regime has remained elevated throughout June and July, with the last 5 periods (P19-P23) averaging 381.2 units. Recent periods (P22, P23) resulted in stockouts due to high demand and low arrival volume from previous small orders (P18 order was only 16 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high service level requirements (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), and on-hand inventory at 0, we must maintain a high base stock to capture the remaining summer peak. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and variance to capture this sustained summer intensity (approx. 381 units/period), covering the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak sustained through mid-July: average demand for Periods 19-23 is 381.2 units, maintaining higher levels than the early June plateau.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is in its summer peak. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P19-P24) is 366.0 units, with a notable peak in P19 (458) and P20 (405). The recent demand has slightly cooled to 333 (P23) and 290 (P24), but historical lead-time arrivals (e.g., the small 16-unit arrival in P22) caused stockouts that make these demand figures potentially understated or volatile. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the product category and late July timing, demand is expected to remain high but potentially start tapering as the back-to-school transition approaches in August. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent summer peak behavior while smoothing the recent volatility. This N (6 periods) covers the high-demand window starting from P19.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860002' (trainer socks) is entering August. Historically, we have seen two peaks: one in April/May (~380 units) and a significant summer surge in June/July (averaging ~381-406 units). Demand in late July (Periods 24 and 25) has moderated slightly to 290 and 266 units. This suggests a seasonal cooling following the peak summer vacation period. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P20 arrival in P24, P21 arrival in P25). I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (approx. late June through end of July) to capture the summer profile while acknowledging the high-volume weeks (avg ~337 units). With the current on-hand inventory of 410 and a large pipeline of 1370, we are well-positioned. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand moderated in late July: average demand for Periods 24-25 is 278 units, down from the June/early July peak of ~380-400, indicating late-summer seasonal cooling for trainer socks.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical data for this 'fine-knit trainer sock' product shows distinct seasonal patterns: a spring peak in April (avg ~380), a robust summer plateau in June/July (avg ~380-400), and a clear cooling trend starting in late July (Period 26). The last three periods (P24-P26) have seen demand levels of 290, 266, and 239, confirming a downward trend as summer ends. For Period 27, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period window to capture this cooling trend (avg ~258.5) across the review and lead time (L+1=5). Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 4 periods to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the summer peak. The lead time L is maintained at the default 4, as arrivals have been consistent. The on-hand inventory is healthy (662), and the pipeline (1099) is sufficient to cover the transition as demand moderates.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation confirmed in August: average demand for Periods 24-26 is 265 units, down from the June/July summer peak of 381 units, signaling the end of peak trainer sock seasonality.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern for 'fine-knit trainer socks', peaking in mid-summer (June/July) and moderating as we move into August. Recent demand figures for Periods 24-27 are 290, 266, 239, and 221, confirming a steady downward trend from the summer peak (~400). I am targeting a demand regime of approximately 220-230 units. On-hand inventory is high at 882 units, with 658 units in-transit (orders from Periods 24-26 expected to arrive over the next three periods). Given the declining seasonal demand and high current stock levels, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the moderating demand trend (average of ~254 units per period) and set L to default (4 periods). The OR backend's cap and base-stock logic will likely result in a low or zero order this period to prevent excessive holding costs as seasonality cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation trend confirmed in late August: average demand for Periods 24-27 is 254 units, continuing to drop from the summer peak (previously ~380) as trainer sock seasonality wanes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3084.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is consistently trending downward as the peak summer season concludes (late August, Period 29). The average demand for the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is ~245, a significant drop from the June/July peak of ~380-400. In Period 28, demand was 208, and in Period 27 it was 221, suggesting a stabilization or further decay around the 200-220 level. On-hand inventory is currently high (868 units) due to large orders placed during the summer peak arriving now. Pipeline inventory (464 units) is also high relative to the new demand levels. Combined, the total inventory position (1332) covers over 6 periods of demand at current rates. To prevent excessive holding costs during this cooling phase, I am reducing mu_hat to 1100 (5 periods * 220 units) and using a recent window (N=5) to capture the lower volatility of the current regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation established in late August: average demand for Periods 24-28 is 244.8 units, confirming a return to early-Spring levels as summer seasonality for trainer socks ends.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860002' (trainer socks) has exited its peak summer seasonal phase. Demand has shown a consistent and sustained decline over the last 6 periods, dropping from a peak of ~400 units to a late-August average of 244.8 units. The most recent demand (Period 29: 199) confirms this downward trend as we move into September. We are currently in a high inventory position (913 on-hand) due to previous peak-level orders arriving during this cooling demand phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand regime (~199-245 units), I will set mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture the cooling trend while the high inventory safely covers demand. This will prevent further overstocking as seasonality continues to wane.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed for September: average demand for Periods 24-29 is 237.2 units, a significant decrease from the summer peak (381 units), reflecting the end of trainer sock seasonality.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering early September (Period 31). Historical demand for these 'fine-knit trainer socks' confirms a clear seasonal decline following the summer peak (~380-400 units). Demand has cooled steadily over the last seven periods (P24-P30), with recent values ranging from 189 to 208. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 211 units, which is significantly lower than the full-history average but reflective of the current post-summer regime. On-hand inventory is high at 944 units following several large arrivals from previous high-demand orders. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to ensure the pipeline covers demand for P31 through P35. Given the cooling trend and high on-hand stock, the OR backend will naturally reduce order quantities. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower autumnal demand level and avoid excessive holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling established: average demand for Periods 26-30 is 211.2 units, a decrease of ~45% from the summer peak, indicating a seasonal shift to lower baseline demand for trainer socks in autumn.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860002' (trainer socks) is experiencing a clear seasonal downturn in demand as we move into mid-September. Historical data from the last 5 periods (P27-P31) shows demand values of 221, 208, 199, 189, and 168, indicating a steady cooling off from the summer peak (~380-400 units). The average demand over these last 5 periods is 197 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 776 units, while the pipeline inventory is 184 units (the order from P30). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (last arrival from P26 arrived on P30, exactly 4 periods). Given the high on-hand stock and decreasing demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to reflect the current cooling trend. This will likely result in a very small or zero order from the OR backend because current inventory levels (on-hand + pipeline) significantly exceed the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat aligned with recent observations ensures we don't over-order during this decline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (fine-knit trainer socks) is experiencing a clear post-summer seasonal decline. Recent demand for Periods 30-32 (189, 168, 136) confirms this downward trend. The most recent demand regime (last 5-7 periods) shows an average of ~183, but the very latest samples suggest a drift towards ~140-150. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current 'On-hand' (640) plus 'In-transit' (283) equals 923 units. Given an estimated demand of roughly 150 per week, this provides over 6 periods of cover (923 / 150 = 6.15), which exceeds the (L+1=5) period planning horizon. As the system already has sufficient stock to cover the seasonal cooldown, any large orders now would result in unnecessary holding costs. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent cooling phase (avg ~166) and N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility during this transition. This should naturally lead the OR backend to order very little or zero units until the high inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand cooling confirmed: demand dropped from ~240 (August) to ~164 (September), a further ~30% reduction as trainer sock seasonality concludes.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late September (Period 34), moving into October. Inventory levels are healthy (On-hand: 406, In-transit: 386), which is appropriate given the significant seasonal decline in demand for trainer socks observed since August. Demand in Period 33 spiked slightly to 234, but the overall trend from Periods 28-32 shows a clear cooling (averaging ~180). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high current inventory relative to the lower autumn demand trajectory (~170-200 units per week), I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6, covering Periods 28-33) to capture this lower baseline while acknowledging the recent Period 33 fluctuation. This conservative approach prevents over-ordering during the off-season of a highly seasonal product.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for trainer socks has significantly moderated from the summer peak (~380 units) to an autumn average. In the most recent periods (P31-P34), demand has averaged 188.75 units, though P33 and P34 showed a slight uptick (234 and 217) compared to early September. We are currently in a post-summer demand regime. On-hand inventory is 372, and in-transit is 448 (consisting of orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34). The order from P30 (183 units) arrived in P34 as expected (lead time = 4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (P30-P34) to capture the stabilize demand around 200 units, while accounting for the recent slight increase to avoid stockouts if demand stabilizes slightly higher than the September lows.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling stabilized: average demand for Periods 31-34 is 188.8 units, confirming a significant drop from summer levels (~380) as expected for trainer sock seasonality in autumn.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks' has exited its summer peak (380-430 units) and settled into an autumn baseline. The average demand for the last five periods (P31-P35) is 184.8 units, confirming the 'autumn cooling' noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P30 and P31 arrivals). I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this lower baseline while acknowledging the slight uptick in P33-P34. This prevents overstocking on a high-holding-cost item as we move deeper into October/November, where trainer sock demand typically remains low or further declines. Pipeline inventory (700 in-transit) plus on-hand (204) is sufficient to cover about 5 weeks of current demand, so the OR backend will likely scale back ordering significantly to optimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand baseline confirmed: average demand for Periods 31-35 is 184.8 units, a ~50% reduction from the summer peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-10-21, and the product is trainer socks. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm that we are in a post-summer demand cooling phase. Average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) is 154.6 units, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~380. The most recent demand (P36) was 117 units, suggesting a potential further drop as we approach late autumn. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P34, P35, and P36). On-hand inventory is 186 and in-transit is 768, which is robust given the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower baseline while allowing for the slight volatility seen in October. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current ~150-180 unit demand rhythm rather than the higher annual or summer averages.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand baseline adjusted: average demand for Periods 32-36 is 154.6 units, indicating a continued decline from the early autumn levels of ~185.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2711.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is currently in a seasonal decline phase as we move into late October. The average demand for the last five periods (P33-P37) is approximately 177 units, which is a significant drop from the summer peak (avg ~380). However, the most recent five-period window (P33-P37) is slightly volatile (117 to 234 units) with an average around 177. Using a recent_N window (N=5) captures this stabilized autumn baseline while moving away from the higher summer/early autumn figures. On-hand inventory is 139, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 745, which covers approximately 4-5 periods of demand at current rates (177 * 5 = 885 vs 139+745 = 884). This suggests the inventory position is now well-aligned with the lower demand regime. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P34-P37).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand baseline stabilized: average demand for Periods 33-37 is 177.4 units, confirmed as the post-peak seasonal level for trainer socks.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (trainer socks) is experiencing a post-summer seasonal decline, stabilizing at an autumn baseline. The average demand for the most recent five periods (P34-P38) is 156.8 units, down significantly from the summer peak of ~380 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of P34's order in P38. Currently, on-hand inventory is 253 units with 680 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). My current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 933 units, which comfortably covers expected demand based on the current mean. To ensure the OR backend maintains this service level during the transition, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (156.8 * 5 = 784) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand baseline stabilized: average demand for Periods 34-38 is 156.8 units, confirming a ~60% reduction from the summer peak as seasonal trainer sock demand settles for the year.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Fine-knit trainer sock' in November (Period 40). Historical data and carry-over insights confirm a strong seasonal decline since the late-summer peak (~380 units), stabilizing at an autumn baseline. The average demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) is 130.6 units, but the most recent two periods (P38-P39) have dropped further to an average of 108.5 units. As we move deeper into November, demand for low-cut trainer socks is expected to remain low or continue a slight downward trend until any holiday-related uptick. On-hand inventory is currently high (420 units) with 427 units in-transit (orders from P36, P37, and P38), which is more than sufficient to cover the next 4+ periods of baseline demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the recent stabilized autumn demand (approx 130/week), as using a longer window would overstate demand based on summer peaks. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand cooling phase for trainer socks. Demand has dropped significantly from the summer peak (~380 units) to a late autumn baseline. For Period 39 and 40, demand was 86 and 95 units respectively. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 115.8 units, while the last 3 periods (P38-P40) average 104 units. Given this cooling trend, I will use a recent_N window of 4 to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 492 with 260 in-transit (orders from P37, P38). Total pipeline inventory is 752 units, which is quite high relative to current demand (~100/week). The OR engine will likely keep order quantities at zero until inventory depletes further to avoid high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling intensified in November: average demand for Periods 38-40 dropped to 104 units, a ~70% reduction from the summer peak, indicating a low winter baseline for trainer socks.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the winter low for 'fine-knit trainer socks'. Demand has significantly cooled since the summer peak (~380 units), with the last 4 periods (P38-P41) averaging only 100 units (86, 95, 88). This indicates a strong seasonal decline as consumers shift away from low-cut trainer socks in winter. Inventory levels are currently high (on-hand: 484), which is more than enough to cover the forecasted demand for the remaining 5 periods of the game (484 on-hand / ~100 per period = ~4.8 periods of supply). With an additional 180 units in-transit (due from Period 38 order), we are significantly overstocked for the current low-demand regime. To maximize profit and minimize holding costs, I am setting parameters to prevent any further ordering. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated based on the recent 4-period low-demand baseline (N=4) to accurately reflect the winter trough, while lead time remains at its confirmed 4-period duration.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand baseline for trainer socks confirmed: demand dropped to ~100 units/period (Periods 38-41), representing a ~75% decrease from summer peak levels.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which has shown a strong seasonal decline from its summer peak (~380 units) to a current winter baseline of approximately 100-110 units. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) is 116.4 units, with the last period showing a slight outlier of 182 units (potentially a pre-holiday promotion or random variation). At the start of Period 43, we have 482 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. With a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Based on the recent average of 116 per week, our total needed stock is approximately 580 units. Since on-hand + pipeline is 482, we are slightly below the seasonal safety target. However, given that we are approaching mid-December and the product is specifically 'trainer socks' (highly seasonal for warm weather), I expect demand to remain low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture this winter baseline, while 'calculate' for lead time confirms the stable 4-period fulfillment.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand baseline for trainer socks established: average demand for Periods 38-42 is 116.4 units/period, a ~70% reduction from summer peak levels.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has stabilized at a low winter baseline. For the last five periods (P39-P43), demand has been 86, 95, 88, 182, and 69, resulting in an average of approx 104 units per period. The spike in Period 42 (182 units) is an outlier in the winter context, possibly a brief promotion or early holiday shopping, but the overall trend remains low. On-hand inventory is 413 units, with 184 units in-transit (ordered in P43, expected P47). Since the game ends at Period 47, and the current on-hand inventory already covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the 100-110 units/period rate, and the in-transit order will arrive in the final period, I will set mu_hat to reflect this stable winter regime using the last 6 samples (N=6) to capture the trend while accommodating the recent variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (mid-December), we're in the middle of a low-demand winter baseline for trainer socks. Recent demand (Periods 40-44) has averaged 103 units, significantly down from the summer peak. We are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47). Currently, we have 332 units on-hand and 282 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 43 and 44). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) will not arrive until Period 49, which is beyond the game's conclusion at the end of Period 47. Therefore, ordering more stock now will only incur holding costs or result in leftover inventory that cannot be sold within the game's timeframe. My objective is to satisfy the remaining 2-3 periods of demand while minimizing ending inventory. On-hand inventory (332) already covers more than 3 periods of demand at the current rate (~100/period), so no further orders are necessary. I will set parameters to prevent the OR backend from placing additional orders.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand baseline confirmed: average demand for Periods 40-44 is 103 units, representing a stable low-season for trainer socks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1988.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late December, approaching the end of the year. Historically, demand for trainer socks in the winter has stabilized at a lower baseline compared to the summer peak. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 107.2 units. Recent periods show: P41 (88), P42 (182 - likely a pre-holiday bump), P43 (69), P44 (81), and P45 (116). The average since the shift in P38 is approximately 110 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 216 and 350 units in-transit (ordered in P43, P44, P45), we are well-covered for the short term. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering since the November drop) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current winter baseline while reflecting the recent volatility seen in P42 and P45.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which follows a strong seasonal pattern. We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30). Historical demand shows a significant decline from the summer peak (~380 units) to a winter baseline. Recent demand (Periods 42-46) averaged 115.4 units. Although the promised lead time is 4 periods, we are tracking in-transit orders from Period 43 onwards that have not yet arrived. The in-transit total of 449 units (from P43-P46) is substantial compared to the current winter demand baseline. To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand season while maintaining availability, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current winter demand regime (~115 units/period). Sigma_hat is also set to recent levels to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains at the default promised 4 periods as there is no conclusive evidence of a permanent shift in delivery speed, though arrivals are currently pending for the late December orders.
