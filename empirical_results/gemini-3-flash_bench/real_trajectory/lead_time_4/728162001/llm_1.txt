The most recent observation (Feb 4) was 25 units. As a basic jersey t-shirt, demand is expected to be relatively stable with a slight upward trend as spring approaches in the northern hemisphere. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive at the start of Period 5 and be available for sale during Period 5. To maintain service levels over the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5 periods), I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. With an average demand of ~35 units/period, total needed is 175 units. Since there is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 175 units to establish a pipeline and stock position.",

To maintain a safe pipeline for L+1 (5 periods) of demand, I estimate total need at roughly 37-50 * 5 = 185-250 units. Since 175 units are arriving in P5, I need to order more to cover the gap while accounting for the current stockout. I will order 50 units to bring the total pipeline (in-transit + new order) to 225 units, which provides coverage for the lead time and restores a buffer.",

The P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (P1+4), and the P2 order in Period 6. This means we must cover demand for P3, P4, and P5 before the first shipment arrives. Total demand for P1-P2 was 146. If demand holds at ~100/week (anticipating continued growth), we need ~400-500 units to cover the lead time window. Current pipeline is only 225.

Current on-hand inventory is critically low at 13 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With a 4-period lead time, an order placed today (P34) will arrive at the start of P39. We must cover demand for P34, P35, P36, P37, and P38 (5 periods). Using the current average of ~160 units, total required coverage is 160 * 5 = 800 units. Pipeline currently consists of 437 (ordered P32, arriving P37) and 450 (ordered P33, arriving P38), totaling 887 units. While the pipeline technically covers the 5-period requirement (887 > 800), the 13 units on-hand will result in a stockout during P34-P36 because the first large shipment doesn't arrive until P37. However, placing an order now does not solve the immediate stockout due to the lead time. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 900. If demand remains at ~160, we have coverage for roughly 5.6 periods. To maintain safety stock for the late-autumn regime and avoid another gap, I will place a moderate replenishment order, but since we already have 887 units arriving in P37-P38, I must be careful not to over-order and incur high holding costs ($1/unit).",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt', which exhibits strong seasonal behavior. We are currently in December (Period 44), a low-season for basic jersey T-shirts. Demand has significantly cooled since the September peak, averaging 75.7 units per period over the last 10 periods (P34-P43). Current on-hand inventory is 460 units with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate (~75 units/period), this inventory will last approximately 6 periods. Since the game ends in Period 47, we have 4 periods remaining (P44, P45, P46, P47). Total expected demand for the remaining duration is roughly 300 units (4 periods * 75 units). With 460 units on hand, we already have a surplus that will result in holding costs through the end of the simulation. Therefore, no further orders should be placed to avoid increasing the terminal holding cost penalty.",

  "rationale": "The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt', which is highly seasonal. We are currently in Period 45 (Dec 16), approaching the end of the game at Period 47. Historical data from early 2019 (Jan/Feb) showed demand in the range of 25-50 units per period. Recent demand has dropped significantly (Period 43: 25, Period 44: 14), confirming a winter low-demand regime. Current on-hand inventory is 446 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 3 periods of the game (Periods 45, 46, and 47), even if demand were to spike back to 100 units/period. The lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now would arrive in Period 49, which is beyond the game's horizon. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) and the excess stock relative to the remaining periods, no further orders should be placed.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt, which typically experiences low demand during the winter months (late December/January). This is confirmed by the most recent demand figures (P43: 25, P44: 14, P45: 21) and the historical data from January 2019 (averaging ~39 units per week). Currently, we are in Period 46 (Dec 23), with just one more period remaining in the game (Period 47). We have an on-hand inventory of 425 units and 0 units in transit. Given the low-demand winter regime (~20-40 units per week), our current stock is more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand. Ordering more would only incur additional holding costs without any benefit to service levels, as the next order wouldn't arrive before the game ends due to the 4-period lead time. Therefore, no new order is placed.",

{
  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30), which is the final period of the game/year. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt', which is highly seasonal. The demand history shows that we have entered the 'Winter' low-demand regime, with the most recent periods (P43-P46) averaging ~21 units per week. This aligns with the historical data provided at the start (Jan 2019 demand values: 51, 30, 35, 39, 25). My current on-hand inventory is 401 units. Given that this is the final period of the simulation, any order placed now would not arrive for another 4 periods (well beyond the simulation end), and I already have significantly more inventory than needed to cover any remaining demand for the current period. Carrying 401 units against an expected demand of ~20-50 units will result in high holding costs, but since I cannot reduce existing inventory, the only action is to place an order of 0 to avoid further costs or unnecessary pipeline buildup.",
