Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a Women's Everyday Basic V-neck T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 36 units (51, 30, 35, 39, 25). There is zero inventory on-hand and zero in-transit. Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since it is the first period, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the known history of 36 units/week. With L=4, the system targets stock to cover 5 periods (L+1). The backend will apply a base stock policy but I will ensure L is set to 'default' as we have no actual lead time data yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18) for SKU 728162001 (Women's V-neck T-shirt). This is a basic garment with stable expected demand. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) average 36 units/week. In Period 1, demand was 53, which exceeded the historical average but aligns with the high sample of 51 early in January. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order was only just placed in Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the Period 1 order (53 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 and become visible in Period 6's decision phase. Since we have 0 on-hand and 0 units sold in Period 1, we are in a stockout. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent historical average plus the Period 1 spike (avg \u2248 39), which helps the OR engine set a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+4=5 periods total). Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4 until we observe historical arrival data to suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Product: 'Talia (1)' V-neck T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics). Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, but stockouts are already occurring due to lead time. Promised Lead Time (L) = 4. Historically, demand was [51, 30, 35, 39, 25] in Jan/early Feb, but increased to 53 and 93 in the last two periods. The recent demand jump (93) might be a pre-spring spike. We have 0 on-hand and 107 in transit (from P1 and P2). The P1 order is expected to arrive at the end of Period 5 (visible at P6). Demand is trending upwards. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand (avg ~48) while keeping sigma_hat default to handle the volatility. L is kept as default (4).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a women's V-neck T-shirt, a basic staple. Historical demand from the provided sample (Jan-Feb) averaged 36 units/week. However, the game history (Feb 11 - Feb 25) shows a significant demand increase to 76.3 units/week (53, 93, 83). This suggests a regime shift or seasonal ramp-up as spring approaches. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 194 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3 totaling 53+54+87=194). Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since P1's order was placed in P1, we expect it to arrive in P5 (P1+4), which will be visible in the P5 conclude message. Currently, no orders have arrived, which is consistent with a 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand (avg ~76.3) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. Lead time (L) remains at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Average weekly demand increased from ~36 to ~76 (+110%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a women's basic V-neck T-shirt, which is showing a strong upward demand trend. Historical demand samples (Period 1-4) were 53, 93, 83, and 121, averaging 87.5 per week, significantly higher than the pre-game samples (avg ~36). The carry-over insight already noted a 110% increase. The promised lead time is 4. No orders have arrived yet (Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 5 as the lead time is 4, and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message). On-hand is currently 0 with 305 units in-transit. Demand is accelerating (most recent observation was 121), so I will use the last 4 samples (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime. For L, I will stick to the default promised lead time of 4 until we have actual arrival confirmations to calculate a shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Average demand over the first 4 periods is 87.5, with a peak of 121 in Period 4, vs initial baseline of ~36.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's V-neck T-shirt, and we are entering spring, which typically sees rising demand for basic apparel. Demand has surged significantly: the first four periods saw demand between 53 and 121, but Period 5 skyrocketed to 270. This 460% increase over the initial baseline indicates a major demand shift or a significant seasonal impulse as weather warms. The promised lead time of 4 periods was confirmed by the arrival in Period 5 of the Period 1 order (arrived=53, lead_time=4). However, inventory is critical: we have 0 on-hand because demand (270) completely overwhelmed the arrival (53). With 385 units in-transit, we must aggressively increase our base stock to meet this new demand level of ~270 units per week. I'm using N=3 for demand to weight the recent surge (83, 121, 270) which averages to ~158, but given the trajectory and the nature of the SKU, I will use an EWMA with a high gamma (0.8) for mu_hat to respond quickly to this trend without overreacting to a single spike. Lead time remains 'default' (4), and sigma_hat will use N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Massive demand surge detected: Period 5 demand (270) is 3x the previous 4-period average (~87). Likely early spring seasonal peak for women's jersey basics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck has exploded from an initial average of ~36 to a new plateau of ~268 over the last two weeks (P5: 270, P6: 266), confirming a massive spring seasonal surge. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand far outstripping the small early orders. Total in-transit is 537 units (from P3, P4, P5, P6). The next arrivals (P3 order of 87 and P4 order of 111) are expected in P7 and P8 respectively. To match the current demand regime of ~268 units/week and cover the review period plus lead time (1+4=5 periods), we need a mu_hat around 1340. Using recent_N=2 for mu_hat captures this new peak perfectly. Sigma_hat is set to default to allow the backend to use the full history to gauge volatility, as we only have two data points for the current high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a high-level regime: Periods 5-6 average 268 units/week, up from the previous Period 4 high of 121. Total growth is +640% from the initial Jan/Feb baseline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU '728162001' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a high-demand regime, likely driven by the transition into spring. The demand over the last three periods (P5-P7) has been 270, 266, and 233 (average ~256), which is a significant jump from the earlier baseline. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5, P2 in P6, P3 in P7). Currently, the inventory position is strained: on-hand is 0 due to demand far outstripping supply. Total in-transit is 866. Based on lead time, we expect the order from P4 (111 units) to arrive in the current Period 8 resolution phase. However, with demand hovering around 250 units, a severe stockout persists. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current high-demand plateau (avg ~256). For L, I will use 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now consistently demonstrated. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the high volatility of this new regime. This approach encourages the OR backend to place aggressive orders to eventually clear the backlog and meet the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime verified: Periods 5-7 demand averages 256 units/week, transitioning the product from a low-volume basic to a high-volume seasonal core item. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019-04-08), the product remains in a stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P4 order of 111 arrived in P8). Demand has shown high volatility recently: after a massive surge to ~270 seasonally, Period 8 saw a drop to 136. This suggests we might be past the initial spring peak or experiencing a temporary dip. Given Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we should aim for the median of the demand distribution (the OR engine sets z*=0). To stabilize the forecast against the recent spike followed by the dip, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat (covering Periods 5-8: 270, 266, 233, 136, average ~226) and sigma_hat to capture the high variance during this transition. This ensures the base stock (L+1 periods) is roughly 1,130 units, which properly accounts for the current pipeline of 1,045 units and anticipates the coming arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: After a sustained high-demand regime (avg ~256 in P5-P7), demand dropped 42% in P8 to 136. Monitoring if this is a shift to a lower post-peak baseline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162001 (Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand spring phase with significant volatility. Demand peaked at 270 in P5 and has since fluctuated (266, 233, 136, 167). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 194.4 units. On-hand inventory is 0, with a pipeline of 999 units. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 9 conclude message where the Period 5 order arrived exactly 4 periods later). Given the recent drop from the 260+ levels to an average of ~150 over the last two weeks, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the high-regime mean while acknowledging the recent cooling. This balances against the risk of over-stocking if the peak has passed, while still maintaining a robust base stock to recover from the current stockout situation.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime identified: After a peak of ~270, demand has averaged 151.5 over the last two periods (P8-P9), suggesting a stabilization below the mid-March surge but significantly above the Jan/Feb baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt, which saw a significant demand surge in March (Periods 5-7, avg ~256) followed by a stabilization in April. In the last three periods (P8-P10), demand has averaged 166 units (136, 167, 195), indicating a post-peak plateau that is still substantially higher than the initial February baseline. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Current on-hand inventory is 11 units, with 866 units in transit (including large orders of 416 and 290 from P7 and P8). To set parameters, I am using the last 3 periods (N=3) to define the current demand regime (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), as this captured the post-March stabilization. This ensures the base stock (target level) reflects the current mid-April demand levels rather than being skewed by the March hyperspike.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime stabilized: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is 166 units, compared to the P5-P7 peak average of 256. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' V-neck T-shirt. Current date is 2019-04-29. Analysis of demand history shows four distinct phases: (1) Initial Jan/Feb baseline of ~36, (2) March surge peaking at 270 (Period 5-7), (3) Post-peak stabilization (Period 8-10) averaging ~166, and (4) The most recent demand (Period 11) at 147. The carry-over insights correctly identified the stabilization at ~166. I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture the transition from the peak to the current stable post-peak regime (P8-P11 average: 161.25). L is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on all delivery conclusions. Since we have 280 units on hand and a large in-transit pipeline (450), the OR backend's inventory balancing will likely slow down ordering to prevent excessive holding costs as we move further into late spring, given the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we completed the receipt of the massive orders placed during the March demand surge (Periods 7 and 8). Current inventory is very high (491 units on-hand) against a sharply declining demand trend. Demand dropped to 79 in Period 12, the lowest since early February. This confirms a significant post-peak cooling for this 'Everyday Basic' V-neck T-shirt after the spring peak. The last 5 periods show a decaying demand pattern: 167, 195, 147, 79 (averaging ~147). However, the most recent value (79) suggests we may be returning to the initial baseline (~50-80). With on-hand (491) plus in-transit (237) totaling 728 units, we are overstocked for the current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the steep decline and L back to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed at Period 12: Demand dropped to 79, a 46% decline from the previous 3-period average (147). Product is transitioning out of its seasonal peak towards a lower baseline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162001' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is clearly exiting its seasonal peak. Demand has plummeted from a peak average of ~256 (P5-P7) to 79 (P12) and now 42 (P13). This represents a significant downward shift as we move further into May. Current on-hand inventory (536) is extremely high relative to current demand, covering over 12 weeks at the current rate of 42 units/period. Additionally, 150 units are in transit (ordered in P10 and P12). With holding costs equal to profit ($1.0), the priority is to avoid further overstocking while the system burns through existing inventory. I am setting L to default (4) as lead times have been perfectly consistent. For demand (mu_hat), I am using N=3 to capture the recent sharp decline (avg ~89/week) rather than the long-term historical mean. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the reduced volatility at these lower volume levels. Given the high pipeline inventory and low demand, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero orders, which is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Demand has dropped for two consecutive periods (79 in P12, 42 in P13), down ~80% from the seasonal peak, indicating the end of the spring surge for this basic jersey item.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), the product has clearly transitioned out of its spring seasonal surge into a lower baseline regime. Demand for the last three periods (P12-P14) has been 79, 42, and 50, averaging 57 units/week. This is a significant drop from the mid-March peak which reached 270. Currently, on-hand inventory is 559 units, which is approximately 10 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. With 77 units already in transit arriving next period (P16), the pipeline is heavily overstocked relative to the new demand level. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. My strategy is to set lead time to 'calculate' to continue using the stable 4-period history and use a 'recent_N' of 3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current lower localized mean (~57) without the influence of the high-demand peak. This will minimize further ordering by the OR backend until inventory levels rationalize with the lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at lower baseline confirmed: Periods 12-14 average 57 units/week, marking a persistent ~80% decline from the average demand seen during the March/April seasonal peak (~250).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Talia V-neck T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) has fully exited its spring seasonal peak (which reached ~270 units/week in March). For the last 4 periods (P12-P15), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower baseline, averaging 57.75 units (79, 42, 50, 60). We are currently in May, moving towards summer, where demand for this basic jersey item is expected to remain at this lower, steady level compared to the pre-peak spring surge. On-hand inventory is currently very high (499 units), representing over 8 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on historical concludes. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining high service levels for a low-cost item (Profit=Holding=$1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the new post-peak regime and prevent over-ordering while the system burns through the excess stock.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt) has exited its spring seasonal peak and settled into a lower baseline demand regime. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), demand has averaged 57.4 units (79, 42, 50, 60, 56), which is approximately a 78% drop from the mid-March/April peak. Current on-hand inventory is 520 units with zero in-transit shipments after the arrival of the Period 12 order (which was the only remaining order in the pipeline). The target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock target is the median (\u03bc\u0302). With a current lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. A 5-period demand forecast based on the recent average is approximately 287 units (57.4 * 5). Since our on-hand inventory (520) significantly exceeds this requirement, the OR backend will correctly stop ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this new stabilized low-demand regime for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt, which experienced a significant seasonal peak in demand during March and April (Periods 5-7, avg ~256). Since Period 12 (late April), demand has sharply declined and stabilized at a much lower level. Over the last five periods (P13-P17), demand has averaged 64.8 units/week. Although Period 17 saw a slight uptick to 116 units (potentially due to early summer early-June heat), the current on-hand inventory of 404 units is very high relative to this recent average. With a lead time of 4 periods (making the look-ahead window 5 periods including current demand), the on-hand stock covers over 6 weeks of demand at the current average rate. There are no units in-transit, as ordering ceased to burn off excess stock. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the post-peak baseline for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, while maintaining the default lead time of 4. Given the high on-hand inventory, the OR backend will likely generate a 0-order which is optimal to minimize holding costs while the stock levels normalize.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P17: 116, P18: 151) indicates a significant upward shift from the lower baseline (P12-P16 average of ~57). This surge in June for a cotton jersey V-neck t-shirt suggests a mid-summer seasonal demand peak. I am currently holding 253 units on-hand with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, my current inventory covers approximately 2 periods of the new high-demand level (~133/week). Since the backend OR logic will order 'max(0, base_stock - on_hand - in_transit)', I need to set mu_hat to reflect the current trajectory to trigger replenishment and avoid a stockout in 2-3 weeks. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the transition from 60 units (P15) to 151 units (P18). L remains at the promised 4 periods as consistent historical data (P5-P14, P16) confirms actual lead time is 4.

Carry-over insight: New mid-summer demand surge detected starting Period 17 (2019/6/03): Demand increased from a baseline of ~57 (P12-P16) to an average of 133 over the last 2 periods (+133%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a mid-summer demand surge for this jersey T-shirt. Demand for the last three periods (P17-P19) has averaged approximately 136 units (116, 151, 140), which is a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~57 units. This matches the 'carry_over_insight' from Period 19. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P16 arrival from P12 order). On-hand inventory is 113, and there is a large order of 187 units placed in Period 19 currently in-transit. To ensure we cover demand during the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this 136 units/week surge. This will prompt the OR engine to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the current sustained higher demand regime without being over-influenced by the significantly higher spring peak or lower May baseline.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed over 3 periods (P17-P19): Average demand is 136 units/week, up from the May baseline of ~57 (+138%).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are in a mid-summer demand surge (Periods 17-20), where demand has averaged 126 units/week (116, 151, 140, 98), significantly up from the May baseline of ~57. While Period 20 saw a slight dip to 98, the overall trend supports a higher mean than the historical average. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt', which remains seasonally relevant in July. I will use a 4-period window (recent_N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this surge specifically, as it reflects the current regime. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (L=4). With on-hand inventory low (15) and a large pipeline (353 units from P19 and P20), the OR backend will calculate a base stock against (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Using N=4 provides a mean of ~126, which covers the current summer throughput without over-ordering based on the earlier massive March peak or under-ordering based on the May trough.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (July 8), we are in the middle of a mid-summer demand surge for this V-neck t-shirt. Period 21 demand was high (173), and the average for the current surge (P17-P21) is 135.6 units/week. However, on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in the last period. Large orders placed in Periods 19, 20, and 21 (totaling 519 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the consistent 4-period lead time observed throughout the history, the order from Period 19 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 23 (becoming visible at the start of Period 24). To stabilize the service level during this high-demand summer period, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the summer surge) to capture the current mean of ~136 units. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx 680 units). Given the stockout and the high demand, I will continue ordering to maintain the pipeline until the in-transit units arrive and inventory stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Average weekly demand from P17-P21 is 135.6 units (+138% vs May baseline). Current 4-period lead time remains stable.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a strong mid-summer seasonal surge. Demand in Period 22 reached 227, the highest since the spring peak, and the average for the last 6 periods (P17-P22) has climbed to 150.8 units per week. We are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The next scheduled arrival (from the P19 order) should occur during Period 23's arrival phase, but it will not be reflected until the start of Period 24. Consequently, we must sustain ordering based on this high-demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the summer surge volume (avg ~151) and sigma_hat (N=6) to account for the increased volatility (std dev ~46). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent completed cycles, so I will stick with 'calculate'. This approach aims to replenish stock levels quickly to meet the current high demand while the backend OR logic balances the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio with a target 50% service level.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge significantly accelerated in Period 22: Recent 6-period average (P17-P22) is 151 units/week, with the latest observation (227) suggesting a potential peak similar to the spring seasonal high.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162001' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt) is currently in a sustained mid-summer demand surge. Demand over the last four periods (P20-P23) has been 98, 173, 227, and 221, yielding an average of approximately 180 units/week. This represents a significant increase from the initial summer surge average of 136 and matches the high-volume core status observed during the spring peak. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P19 order arrived in P23). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 568 units (orders from P20-P23). We need to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the current high-regime average (~180/week) to capture the remaining summer peak. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this specific high-demand phase while ensuring the backend computes the safety stock based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge has accelerated to a high-volume regime in Period 22: Average demand for P21-P23 is 207 units/week, comparable to the March seasonal peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a high-volume mid-summer demand regime (Date: 2019/7/29). Over the last 4 periods (P21-P24), demand has averaged 216.75 units/week (173, 227, 221, 246), which is significantly higher than the earlier summer baseline and matches the spring seasonal peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of P19 and P20 orders exactly 4 periods later. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 680 units. To maintain service levels during this active surge and avoid stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this specific high-volume regime. This will calculated base stock level for the L+1 window (5 weeks).

Carry-over insight: High-volume mid-summer surge intensified: Average demand for P21-P24 reached 216.75 units/week, comparable to the March peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162001 (Women's Everyday T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand mid-summer regime. Period 25 demand dropped to 92 units, which is a significant decline from the previous 4-week average of ~216 units. However, this follows a very high peak (227, 221, 246), and a single lower data point is not yet evidence of a sustained downward regime shift, especially since July/August remains prime season for t-shirts. On-hand inventory is 74, with 782 units in-transit. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P23, P24, and P25). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the average of the build-up and the recent peak (avg ~191), ensuring we don't over-react to the single-period dip in Period 25 while still accounting for its effect on the mean. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility seen during this surge.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is an 'Everyday Basic' V-neck T-shirt, which experienced a significant mid-summer demand surge. We are currently in mid-August (Period 27). Reviewing recent demand: P22 (227), P23 (221), P24 (246), P25 (92), P26 (157). The sudden drop in P25 and partial recovery in P26 suggests high volatility or a potential transition out of the peak summer volume. However, given the 'Everyday Basic' nature, demand is unlikely to crash to January levels immediately. I will use the last 5 periods (P22-P26) to capture this high-volume but volatile regime (Avg: 188.6). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P23-P26). On-hand inventory is low (76), and while 726 units are in transit, we must maintain a high base stock to avoid the stockouts observed in P21-P24. I will set L to 4, and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand, high-variance environment.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P22-P26) shows high volume (avg 188.6) but increased volatility compared to the spring peak, with a significant temporary dip in Period 25.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162001' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand mid-summer regime. While demand peaked in Period 24 (246), the last few periods show a softening/volatility (P25: 92, P26: 157, P27: 84). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P22-P27) is 154.5 units per week, which is significantly lower than the P22-P24 peak average of ~231. This suggesting we are moving past the main summer peak as we enter late August. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With 790 units in-transit (P24-P27 orders) and 69 units on-hand, which is roughly 5.5 weeks of cover at current rates, I will use a 6-period recent average (P22-P27) to capture the current volatility and expected seasonal decline while maintaining sufficient service levels for the remainder of the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P22-P27) showed a mean of 154 units but high volatility compared to the spring peak, likely signaling the transition towards late-summer/autumn demand baselines.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162001 (Women's T-shirt) is showing a clear downward trend following its mid-summer seasonal peak. Periods 25-28 show demand figures of 92, 157, 84, and 89 respectively. The average demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) has dropped to 110 units/week, a significant decrease from the previous high-volume regime of ~210 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 258 units on hand and 512 units in transit (expected arrivals in P29, P30, P31, and P32), total pipeline inventory is 770 units. At the current demand rate of ~110, this covers approximately 7 weeks, which is well above the L+1 (5 weeks) planning horizon. Therefore, I am reducing the demand forecast parameters to reflect this new, lower volume regime (N=3) to prevent overstocking and excessive holding costs as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed at Period 28: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P26-P28) is 110 units, down ~49% from the mid-summer peak average of 216 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162001' (a jersey V-neck T-shirt) is currently in a downward demand transition as the mid-summer peak (June-August) concludes and we enter September. In Period 29, demand was 133, and the average of the last three periods (P27-P29) is approximately 102 units, a significant drop from the peak average of ~216. Current on-hand inventory is 393 units, with 244 units in-transit (orders from P26 and P27 arriving in P30 and P31). Total available inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 637 units. Given the lead time (L=4) plus current period coverage (L+1=5), and a projected demand of ~100 units/week, we have roughly 6 weeks of stock. Since the demand is clearly trending down at the end of the summer season, I will use 'recent_N' (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower, post-peak regime and prevent over-ordering. L remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September 2019. Demand in Period 30 was 170 units, following a period of 133, suggesting that the post-summer decline noted in Period 29 has stabilized or slightly rebounded. The 'Women's Everyday Basics' category typically maintains a steady baseline in autumn. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P28-P30) is approximately 131 units. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 326), with a scheduled arrival of 141 units (ordered in P27) expected to arrive during the current period (P31). Given the lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit = 467), we are well-covered for the (L+1) horizon (5 weeks * ~131 = 655 units). However, because holding cost equals profit ($1.00), the backend will naturally be conservative. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent post-peak stabilization (avg ~131), and L as default (4), which aligns with historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-summer surge: Average demand for P28-P30 is 131 units/week, down from the mid-summer peak but significantly higher than the spring baseline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162001 is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' V-neck T-shirt. Current date is mid-September (2019/9/16). Historically, we've seen two major demand peaks: an early spring surge (March) and a mid-summer surge (July/August). Recent demand has stabilized in a post-summer regime, averaging 156.3 units/week over the last 3 periods (P29-P31), which is higher than the early January baseline but lower than the peak summer surge. Since this is an 'Everyday Basic', demand is expected to persist but likely soften as we move deeper into autumn. On-hand inventory is healthy at 301 units, with 187 units in-transit (expected to arrive in Period 35). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50%, making the OR backend's goal roughly to keep on-hand close to the expected demand. I will use a recent_N of 4 periods (P28-P31) to capture the current stabilization trend, as this reflects the most recent demand behavior post-mid-summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in a post-summer regime at Period 31: Average demand for P28-P31 is 139.5 units/week, down from the mid-summer peak (~216) but significantly above the spring baseline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime that has stabilized significantly higher than the initial spring baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P28-P32), demand has averaged 143.6 units (89, 133, 170, 166, 160), showing consistency compared to the volatile mid-summer peak (~216 units). The product, a V-neck cotton jersey T-shirt, is an everyday basic likely to maintain steady demand throughout autumn. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the arrival from P27 concluding in P31 as expected. Inventory levels are healthy with 141 on-hand and 389 in-transit (from orders in P31 and P32). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this stabilized post-summer mean of ~144 units per week, which ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current consumption rate while balancing against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 28-32 show a stable mean of 143.6 units/week, down from the mid-summer peak (~216) but significantly higher than the May baseline (~57).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is entering the end of September (Period 34). Historical data shows demand stabilization at a post-summer baseline. The current average demand from Period 28 to Period 33 is 143 units/week. While on-hand inventory is low (1 unit), there are 577 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, no orders were placed between Period 28 and 30, explaining the current gap in arrivals. However, orders from Period 31 (187 units) are expected to arrive in Period 35, and Period 32 (202 units) in Period 36. This pattern suggests we are currently in a temporary 'stock-out' phase before the next wave of arrivals. To avoid excessive over-ordering while maintaining the current baseline, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=6 (capturing the post-summer stable regime) and keep lead time at the promised 4 periods, which has remained consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a post-summer demand phase (Date: 2019/10/7). Demand has significantly dropped in the most recent period (P34 demand: 46) compared to the stable post-summer average of ~140 units/week (P28-P33). This drop likely signals a seasonal transition into late autumn/winter for T-shirts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (orders from P24-P27 arrived consistently with L=4). However, there is a visible inventory gap: on-hand is currently 0 due to an stockout in P34, where demand (46) exceeded available inventory (1). In-transit inventory (714 units) is substantial, including orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34. While L is stable, I must handle the recent demand drop cautiously to avoid overstocking while ensuring the OR engine recovers from the current stockout. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the transition from the stable post-summer phase (~140) to the lower recent observation (46), effectively averaging down the forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop detected at Period 34 (46 units), down ~67% from the previous 5-period average (141.6). Possible transition to late-autumn lower baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-89.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt' has entered a significant downward shift as of Period 34 (2019/9/30). Average demand dropped from ~140 units (P28-P33) to an average of 47.5 units over the last two periods (P34-P35), marking a ~66% decline. This likely indicates the end of the summer/early autumn season and a transition to a lower late-autumn/winter baseline. In-transit inventory is high (527 units), including large orders from P32 (202 units), P33 (188 units), and P34 (137 units) expected to arrive in Periods 36, 37, and 38 respectively. With on-hand inventory at 138 and these large arrivals pending against a current demand of ~48 units/week, we are significantly over-provisioned. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the new lower demand level and prevent further ordering by the OR backend, allowing existing pipeline inventory to be absorbed.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop confirmed starting Period 34: 2-period average (P34-P35) is 47.5 units, down 66% from the previous 5-period average (141.6). Transition to late-autumn lower baseline in effect.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-160.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162001' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt) is entering late October. Historical data from this time last year (Jan-Feb 2019) showed a baseline of ~36 units/week. Recent observations confirm a sharp downward trend from the mid-summer peak: demand dropped to 46, 49, and then slightly rebounded to 90 in Period 36. The average for the last 3 periods (P34-P36) is 61.6 units, aligning with a post-seasonal lower baseline for basic t-shirts as colder weather approaches. Inventory levels are currently high with 250 on-hand and 325 in-transit (orders from P33 and P34). The order from P33 (188 units) is expected to arrive in Period 37 conclude, and the order from P34 (137 units) in Period 38 conclude. Given the low demand regime (~62 units/week) and high existing pipeline (575 total units), no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent stabilized lower baseline, which will naturally suppress ordering via the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at late-autumn lower baseline confirmed: Periods 34-36 average 61.7 units/week, a ~56% decrease from the September stabilization level (~140).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a late-autumn demand regime, which stabilized starting around Period 34 (late September/early October). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P34-P37) is 67 units/week, a significant drop from the September stabilization level. On-hand inventory is currently high (355 units) following the arrival of orders from the previous high-demand period. With 137 units still in-transit (expected in Period 38/39) and on-hand inventory already covering over 5 weeks of current demand, the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the lower demand baseline. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower regime (expected average ~67*5 = 335), and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current reduced volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is currently in a late-autumn demand regime following a significant drop from the mid-summer peak. Since Period 34 (late Sept/early Oct), weekly demand has stabilized at a lower baseline, averaging 73.8 units over the last 5 periods (P34-P38). The current date is 2019/11/04, moving into late autumn/early winter where demand for basic jersey T-shirts typically remains stable or softens further. Inventory is currently high (391 units on-hand) due to the arrival of orders placed during the previous higher-demand regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand rate (~5.3 weeks of supply), and no units in transit, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the lower baseline period) to reflect the current regime. This will likely result in a zero order this period as we draw down the surplus inventory, minimizing holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the lower demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand stabilization confirmed (P34-P38): Average demand is 73.8 units/week, a ~48% decrease from the Sept stabilization level (~141).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Talia (1) V-neck T-shirt' is an everyday basic. It has gone through two major seasonal peaks (spring and mid-summer). Currently, we are in the late-autumn period (mid-November). The Carry-over Insights indicate a sustained downward shift in demand starting from Period 34 (2019/9/30). The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P34-P39) is approximately 70 units/week (46, 49, 90, 83, 101, 51), significantly lower than the September stabilization level (~141). We have a high on-hand inventory of 340 units and no units in transit. Since the current on-hand inventory (340) already covers nearly 5 weeks of the current demand regime (70 * 4.8), and the lead time is 4 periods, we are overstocked relative to the holding cost (which equals profit). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods to reflect this lower late-autumn baseline. The OR backend will likely generate a zero order to bleed off the excess inventory and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (P34-P39) confirmed: Demand has averaged 70 units/week, a 50% reduction from the September level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a late-autumn demand regime (starting Period 34), which has stabilized at approximately 70 units per week (P34-P40 average = 71 units). The current date is November 18, and we are moving into the late holiday/winter season for a V-neck cotton jersey T-shirt. Historically, this product saw its lowest demand in Jan/Feb (~36/week), so a gradual decrease or relative stability at the current 70/week level is expected before a potentially larger winter dip. The current on-hand inventory is 261 units, with only 10 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 41 plus the lead time (4 periods), totaling 5 periods of demand. At the current mean of 70 units/week, required inventory is ~350 units. With total current inventory (on-hand + in-transit) at 271, we are slightly under-stocked for the 5-period horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand mean and variance since the late-autumn shift (P34-P40). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product is in a late-autumn demand regime characterized by lower and relatively stable volumes compared to summer peaks. Over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), demand has averaged 70 units per week. The system currently has 197 units on-hand and 96 units in-transit (86 from P41 and 10 from P40), totaling 293 units of projected inventory. With a lead time of 4 periods, this current stock covers approximately 4.2 weeks of demand at the current average rate. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and relatively low profit margin ($1.0), the backend logic (q=0.5) will target a base stock level near the median demand. I will use the recent 8-period window (N=8) to capture this stabilized late-autumn demand regime while maintaining lead time at the promised 4 periods, as arrivals have been consistent.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162001' (V-neck T-shirt) is currently in a late-autumn/winter regime. Demand in Period 42 was 134, significantly higher than the recent 8-period average of ~75. This likely reflects a Black Friday/Cyber Monday (late November) surge, a common seasonal calendar event for apparel. Since this is likely a temporary peak followed by a December stabilization or drop, I will use a balanced forecast. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 63 and in-transit at 155 (total 218), and expecting lead time + review period (5 periods) of demand, I need to ensure the base stock covers approximately 5 * 85 = 425 units. The OR backend will calculate the order based on mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat to capture the shift from the low October baseline into the late November volatility, while keeping sigma_hat default to handle the increased variance from the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Late November demand surge detected (134 units in P42), likely related to Black Friday seasonality, interrupting the previously stable late-autumn baseline of 70 units/week.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162001 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck t-shirt. Current date is 2019-12-09, following the late November surge (likely Black Friday) which saw demand hit 134 in Period 42. Demand in Period 43 dropped to 25, suggesting the peak has passed, though historical trends for jersey basics often show high gifting/replenishment demand throughout December. On-hand inventory is 38 units with 325 units in-transit. Shipments from Periods 40 (10 units), 41 (86 units), 42 (59 units), and 43 (170 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 44, 45, 46, and 47 respectively, assuming the stable 4-period lead time. To manage the end of the year and potential post-holiday stabilization, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 6 periods (P38-P43) which captures the late-autumn baseline (avg ~70) and the recent spike, providing a balanced forecast of approximately (1+4) * 75.5 units. Sigma reflects the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late November surge confirmed at Period 42 (134 units), with an immediate drop in Period 43 (25 units), indicating high-velocity promotional volatility for this basic jersey item.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (2019/12/16). Demand has recently shown high volatility due to late-November promotions (Black Friday), with a surge to 134 units in P42 followed by a sharp drop to 25 and 14 in P43-P44. Historically, this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) experienced significant spring and summer surges. As we approach late December and the end of the year, demand is expected to remain at a lower post-promotional baseline before potentially rising again in early spring. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 34, with 331 units in-transit (ordered P41-P44). To avoid overstocking during the year-end lull while maintaining coverage for another potential promotional spike or early spring demand, I will use a 5-period average (N=5) for mu_hat to incorporate both the surge and the recent drop, smoothing the forecast to ~52 units/week (total mu_hat of ~263 for (1+L)). Sigma_hat will use the same window to capture the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand drop confirmed: Following the P42 spike (134), demand fell to an average of 19.5 units in P43-P44 (-85%). Monitoring for year-end stabilization.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. We are in a post-Black Friday/pre-Holiday lull for this basic jersey t-shirt. Following the Black Friday spike (P42, 134 units), demand significantly dropped to an average of 19.3 units/week over the last three periods (P43-P45). The target is to stabilize inventory levels for the year-end and early January periods. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand is 99 units, and 245 units are in-transit (reaching out to P49). Given the low recent demand (avg ~20) and high pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current low-demand regime (avg ~20 * 5 periods = 100 total expected), which will effectively halt ordering until the pipeline digests. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to capture the low volatility of this current regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand crash confirmed: Average demand for P43-P45 is 20 units/week, down from the P34-P39 late-autumn baseline of 70 (-71%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-110.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-holiday, year-end period (2019/12/30). A significant demand drop occurred following the Black Friday spike (P42: 134 units), with demand averaging only 21 units/week over the last four periods (P43-P46). This represents a 70% decrease compared to the late-autumn baseline of 70 units/week. Current inventory status: On-hand = 134 units, In-transit = 186 units (from P43-P44 orders). These in-transit units are expected to arrive in Periods 47 and 48 based on the stable 4-period lead time. Given the extremely low current demand regime and substantial existing/pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 samples (N=4) to reflect the current post-holiday baseline, which will likely curtail further ordering until inventory is digested.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Demand for P43-P46 has averaged 21 units/week, confirming a sustained lower baseline following the year-end peak.
