Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 562245046 is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' 5-pocket skinny jean. Historical demand shows a consistent upward trend over the last 5 weeks (96, 108, 122, 131, 140), suggesting a transition from winter into early spring fashion demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no inventory (0 on-hand, 0 in-transit) and no observed lead-time data yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat), the recent trend is too strong to use a global mean; I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current level (avg ~119 per week). Since total exposure is (1+L) periods, mu_hat will target roughly 595 units. Sigma_hat is also calculated from the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's 5-pocket jeans SKU. Historical demand shows a consistent upward trend: 96, 108, 122, 131, 140, and most recently 155 in Period 1. This indicates a growth regime as we move further into the pre-spring retail season. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the order from Period 1 (149 units) will not arrive until Period 5 (L=4), we are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and lost all demand in Period 1. To capture the recent growth trend and high demand of 155, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to emphasize the most recent acceleration. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of this growth phase. L will remain at 'default' (4) as we have no evidence yet of lead-time deviation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU 562245046 (Womens 5-pocket jeans) is showing a strong upward demand trend: 96, 108, 122, 131, 140 (pre-game samples) followed by 155 and 193 in Periods 1 and 2. This represents a significant acceleration since early February, likely driven by seasonal transition into spring fashion. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we have lost sales for two periods. In-transit inventory is 321 (149 from P1 + 172 from P2). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in P6). To capture the recent momentum, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 (P2: 193, P1: 155, Sample 5: 140; avg=162.67) to elevate the forecast. Sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N=3 to reflect the increased volatility during this growth phase. L is set to default as we have no evidence yet of lead-time deviation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a pair of women's skinny jeans, which typically shows steady growing demand in the early spring. Historical demand (pre-game and P1-P3) shows a clear upward trend: 96, 108, 122, 131, 140 (pre-game) followed by 155, 193, and 207 (P1-P3). This indicates a significant demand regime change compared to the initial samples. Promised lead time is 4 periods. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5, visible in P6 conclude), which is consistent with the promised lead time. Inventory is currently 0, and we have a large pipeline in-transit (529 units). Given the consistent growth, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~185/period) rather than the lower historical average. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L)*mean + z*sqrt(1+L)*std. With L=4, it targets roughly 5 periods of demand. My choice of N=3 for mu_hat reflects the most recent growth trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected from Period 1: demand increased from a pre-game average of ~120 to a recent average of ~185 (+54%) over P1-P3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' skinny jean. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, the first order (placed P1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (read at P6). Consequently, our current on-hand inventory is 0, and all 759 units ordered so far (149+172+208+230) are correctly in-transit. Demand has shown a significant and sustained upward trend: 155, 193, 207, 257. Pre-game average was ~119, but the average of the last 4 periods is 203. Given the steady increase, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this growth. Lead time remains at the promised 4 periods as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest otherwise. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~120 (pre-game) to 203 (+69%) over Periods 1-4, with P4 reaching 257.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18. The SKU is a 'Luna skinny RW' jean, part of the Womens Everyday Collection. Demand has shown a significant and sustained upward trend, growing from a pre-game average of ~115 to 312 in Period 5. The last three periods (P3-P5) average 258.7 units per week. Lead time observation: The P1 order arrived in P5 (L=4), matching the promised lead time. Inventory status: On-hand is 0 due to high demand outstripping the first arrival. In-transit pipeline is 883 (P2-P5 orders). Since demand is accelerating (155 -> 193 -> 207 -> 257 -> 312), the 'recent_N' method with N=3 is appropriate to capture the most recent growth regime for the forecast. I will use L=4 (default) as the observed lead time confirms the promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend accelerating: average demand over the last 3 periods (P3-P5) is 258.7, a 125% increase over the pre-game mean of 115.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 7 (2019/03/25). We are seeing a strong upward trend in demand for this item ('Luna skinny RW' jeans), likely driven by the start of the spring season. Demand over the last three concluded periods (P4-P6) averaged 268.3, compared to the initial pre-game average of ~115. Specifically, demand in P5 reached a peak of 312 before settling at 236 in P6. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (orders from P1 and P2 arrived exactly 4 periods later in P5 and P6). However, the system is currently stock-out constrained (on-hand is 0, and all arrivals are immediately sold), meaning actual demand is likely even higher than sales. To capture the recent accelerating trend while accounting for volatility, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will focus the OR engine on the most recent demand regime (avg ~268), ensuring the base stock level (1+L periods) is sufficient to cover the upcoming 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend continuing: average demand over the last 3 periods (P4-P6) has risen to 268.3, representing a 133% increase over the pre-game mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $832.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW' is experiencing a significant demand increase likely tied to the spring season (April 1st). Recent demand (P4-P7) averages 254 units, compared to the pre-game average of ~115. While P6 and P7 dipped slightly from the P5 peak of 312, they remain high. Arrival data from P5-P7 confirms a stable lead time (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand consistently consumes all arriving units (P5 arrive 149 vs 312 demand; P6 arrive 172 vs 236 demand; P7 arrive 208 vs 211 demand). The pipeline inventory (1182) covers roughly 4.6 periods of current demand, but given we are out of stock and demand is volatile, I will use recent trends (last 4 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the (L+1) window (5 periods) with a more responsive forecast to prevent further lost sales during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Demand over the last 4 periods (P4-P7) has averaged 254 units, significantly higher than the initial seed data, though showing high variance (P5: 312, P7: 211). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245046' (Luna skinny RW jeans) is experiencing a period of high growth and high demand variance during the spring season (April). Actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promise. Initial stockouts (Sold < Demand) occurred through Period 8 because the on-hand inventory was insufficient to cover the realization of demand spikes (P5: 312, P8: 305). Current inventory state: 0 on-hand units with 1,121 units in-transit (orders from P5-P8). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is 264.2 units. Given the high variance and stockout history, I will set mu_hat using the 5-period average (recent_N=5) and increase sigma_hat by using 'recent_N=5' to capture the recent volatility (range 211 to 312). This will calculate a base stock designed to better cover the (L+1) window, ensuring the pipeline can support potential 300+ demand weeks while considering the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains high through early April, averaging ~264 over the last 5 periods (P4-P8), with frequent spikes above 300. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, and the product is a women's skinny jean. Demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime significantly above the pre-game mean. Over the last 5 periods (P5-P9), demand has averaged 263 units (312, 236, 211, 305, 251), showing a sustained shift from the initial 120-140 range. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Currently, we have 22 on-hand and 1131 in-transit. The in-transit includes orders from P6 (346 units), P7 (333 units), P8 (169 units), and P9 (283 units). The P6 order is expected to arrive during the resolution of P10, as the Lead Time is 4 periods. Since the current demand regime has been stable for 5 periods, I will use N=5 for both demand and volatility (sigma) to capture the current mean and high variance (ranging from 211 to 312). Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the confirmed historical arrival data.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the product ('Luna skinny RW' superstretch denim) is moving into late spring. Historical demand since Period 4 has stabilized at a higher level than the initial seed data. The last five periods (P6-P10) show demands of 236, 211, 305, 251, and 184, averaging 237.4 units/week. While P10 showed a slight dip (184), the overall trend since March remains significantly higher than the 120-unit starting mean. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1 to P6). On-hand inventory is 184, and the pipeline is extremely full (1030 units, covering orders from P7-P10). I will use recent_N=5 to capture the sustained higher demand regime of the last 5 weeks for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at a high level: Average demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 237.4, +98% higher than pre-game mean (120), despite a seasonal dip in P10.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical data (P1-P11) shows a shift in demand from a pre-game average of ~120 to a significantly higher mean. Over the last 5 periods (P7-P11), demand has averaged 205.6 units, but with visible volatility (ranging from 177 to 305). The product, 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Collection jeans), is a staple item, but demand appears to be stabilizing after an initial spring surge and a recent dip in late April (possibly post-Easter). On-hand inventory is healthy at 340, with 756 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P11). To account for the recent stabilized demand while maintaining enough safety stock for potential spikes, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6, covering P6-P11) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6). Lead time (L) remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a new high-level regime following the early spring peak. Average demand over Periods 8-11 is approximately 229 units, compared to the initial seed data of ~120.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/06. The product is a staple item (5-pocket skinny jeans). Historically, we saw a demand surge in March/April (averaging ~260-300), which has since stabilized to a lower but steady regime. Over the last four periods (P9-P12), demand has been 251, 184, 177, and 211, averaging 205.75 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 298, and in-transit is 718 (total pipeline = 1016). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since demand appears to have cooled from the early spring peak but remains significantly higher than the initial seed data of ~120, I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand and standard lead time calculations. N=5 covers P8-P12 (demand: 305, 251, 184, 177, 211), which captures the transition to the current post-peak level. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the more recent volatility and mean demand level.

Carry-over insight: Post-spring demand stabilization: Demand has settled into a new regime of ~206 units/period (P9-P12 avg) after the March/April peak (~260+). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Demand for 'Luna skinny RW' jeans appears to have stabilized after the spring peak observed in March/April. Reviewing the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand values are 251, 184, 177, 211, and 225, resulting in an average of 209.6 units per period. This is significantly lower than the peak period (P5-P8 average of 276) but much higher than the initial seed data (~120). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 356 units on hand and 647 in transit (P10 order of 245, P11 order of 59, P12 order of 131, and P13 order of 212), the pipeline is well-stocked. We will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean and volatility to reflect this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient stock for the current demand regime. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if the current pipeline covers the (L+1) window, which is 5 periods of demand (~1050 units), versus the current total inventory (~1003 units).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has settled at 209.6 units/period, down from the March/April peak average of ~276.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand shows a peak in March and April (averaging ~260+ units), followed by a stabilization in May. The last five periods (P10-P14) show an average demand of 188.4 units, with P14 dropping to 145 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P10 order arrived P14). I am currently carrying high on-hand inventory (456 units) and significant in-transit inventory (505 units), totaling 961 units of cover. To avoid excessive holding costs in a post-peak environment while protecting against potential demand variability, I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current regime length (P10-P14) where demand has clearly slowed down from the early spring peak. L=4 remains the appropriate lead time estimate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-peak stabilization (May) shows demand averaging 188.4 units/period (P10-P14), a significant decrease from the March/April peak of ~260 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak in March and April (averaging ~260+ units) followed by a notable cooling trend throughout May. In Period 15, demand dropped to 82 units, confirming a shift into a lower-demand seasonal regime for this denim product as warmer weather approaches. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 158 units, but the most recent two periods (P14-P15) dropped to 145 and 82 respectively, suggesting the mean is currently closer to 150 or lower. On-hand inventory is 433 units with 486 units in transit, which is ample to cover the lead time. Lead time remains consistently observed at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current cooling trend while smoothing the volatility of the most recent dip. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the increased variability seen during this regime transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-peak cooling trend (May) has stabilized significantly lower than Spring levels. Mean demand over P11-P15 dropped to 158 units/period (-25% compared to March/April). Period 15 demand of 82 units suggests a potential new low for the summer season.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Collection) is experiencing a sharp seasonal decline as we enter June. Demand has dropped from a mid-spring high of over 250 units to just 51 units in Period 16, representing a decrease of approximately 80% from the peak. The last three periods (P14-P16) averaged 92.7 units, and P16 alone was 51. Given the product description (skinny superstretch jeans) and the date (June 3rd), a summer lull is expected. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (513) is very high relative to recent demand (8x current weekly sales), and the pipeline (384) will further inflate stock. To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P14-P16) to capture the cooling trend while the OR backend's inventory cap prevents over-ordering during this surplus.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal lull confirmed: Demand has plummeted from a March/April peak of ~260 to a June 3rd low of 51 units. 3-period average (P14-P16) is 92.7 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-535.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (a 5-pocket denim jean) has entered a significant summer seasonal trough. Demand has decreased over the last four periods from 82 to 38 units, with the most recent Period 17 recording only 38 units. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P15-P17) is 57 units. Current inventory is extremely high: on-hand inventory is 687 units and in-transit is 172 units (representing shipments from P14, P15, and P16), totaling 859 units. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we only need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current rate of ~57 units/period, required stock is approximately 285 units. Since 859 units are already available or incoming, we are significantly overstocked and must halt ordering to minimize holding costs. L is kept at 'default' (4) as arrivals are consistent. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent summer demand drop while the OR engine's capping logic prevents unnecessary new orders.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal trough confirmed: June demand for denim jeans has fallen to an average of 57 units/period (P15-P17), a ~70% reduction from the May average of ~188.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (skinny denim jeans) has entered a clear summer seasonal trough as of mid-June 2019. Demand has dropped dramatically from a March/April peak of ~260 to a 4-period average (P15-P18) of approximately 60.7 units. The current on-hand inventory of 718 units is extremely high relative to this new demand regime, covering over 11 weeks of supply at current rates. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the OR engine targets a high service level, but my goal is to prevent further inventory accumulation while demand is low. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (Periods 15-18), which will result in significantly lower orders (likely zero due to the current inventory surplus) and minimize holding costs while the seasonal lull persists.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Luna skinny jeans', a womenswear item. We are currently in late June (P20), which is the peak of the summer seasonal lull for denim jeans. Demand has plummeted from a March/April peak of ~260-310 units to a June average of approximately 61 units (P17-P19: 38, 72, 74). Current on-hand inventory is 684 units, which is extremely high (equivalent to >10 periods of current demand). In-transit inventory consists of P16 (29 units), which will arrive during P20 arrivals. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the low seasonal demand, the priority is to stop ordering and let inventory bleed down to avoid excessive holding costs ($1/unit). I will use an explicit low mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation (which targets (1+L) periods of demand) remains below the current pipeline inventory, resulting in a zero order from the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal lull bottomed: June demand (P17-P19) averages 61.3 units, a significant drop from the May average of 145 units.

Demand over the last five periods has averaged 60.8 units, consistent with the expected low for this category during hot weather. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 644 units with zero in-transit, providing over 10 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. This significantly exceeds the target base stock level for the (L+1)=5 period lead-plus-review cycle. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to reflect this lower mid-summer regime. The OR backend will likely calculate a base stock around 350-400 units, resulting in a zero order given the 644 units on hand, which is appropriate to minimize holding costs while the category clears excess stock ahead of the late-summer 'Back-to-School' transition.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal lull sustained through June/early July: June demand (P16-P20) averaged 60.8 units/period, down from May average of ~150 and March/April peak of ~260.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 (women's skinny jeans) is currently in a deep summer seasonal lull. Demand has stabilised at a significantly lower level compared to the spring peak. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has averaged 68.2 units, with the most recent observation at 88 units. This is a consistent trend throughout June and early July. Current on-hand inventory is 556 units with no units in transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are covered for approximately 8 periods of demand at the current rate (556 / 68.2 \u2248 8.1). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this low-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level remains below our current high on-hand inventory to prevent unnecessary holding costs.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of women's skinny jeans. We are currently in mid-July (Period 23). Historical data and carry-over insights indicate a significant demand peak in March/April (Spring), followed by a cooling trend in May, and a deep seasonal lull in June/July (Summer). Demand bottomed out at 38 units in early June and has recently stabilized/slightly ticked up (P21: 88, P22: 114). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is approx 83.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (442 units) with no units in transit. Given the current demand levels and a lead time of 4 periods, our current safety stock is more than sufficient to cover the (L+1) = 5 period window (approx 417 units needed). The system has already correctly stopped ordering (ordered=0 for several periods) to burn off excess inventory accumulated during the demand drop. I will continue using a recent_N strategy for demand to reflect this lower summer regime, setting N=5 to capture the current trough. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal lull remains in effect; July demand is showing a slight recovery from the June bottom but remains significantly lower (~83 units/period) than the Spring peak (~260 units/period).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of superstretch skinny jeans, which typically experiences a summer lull (June/July) before a potential pick-up for late summer/back-to-school transitions. Current date is July 22 (Period 24). Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) has averaged 85.2 units, showing a slight recovery from the June bottom (~60 units) but still far below the spring peak (~260 units). On-hand inventory is 361 units, which is quite high relative to current demand (~4 weeks of stock if demand remains at 85/week). To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for a possible late summer demand increase, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect the current regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, so method 'default' is used.

Carry-over insight: July demand shows a slight recovery from the June bottom, averaging 85.2 units/period (P19-P23) compared to June's average of ~61 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 (Womens Denim Jeans) is currently at the tail end of a summer seasonal lull. Demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to its Spring peak, with an average of approximately 80 units/period over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). On-hand inventory is 309, with 99 units in-transit (ordered in P23 and P24). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the last observed arrivals (P17-P20). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and the fact that we have over 3 periods of supply already on hand (309 / 80 \u2248 3.86), the objective is to prevent further inventory accumulation while maintaining a safe stock level for a possible late summer/early fall demand recovery. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stabilized summer regime (approx. 80 mean demand) and L=default (4).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization: Demand for denim jeans has held steady at a lower seasonal regime, averaging 79.8 units/period over the last 5 periods (P20-P24).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 (women's superstretch denim jeans) is currently in a summer seasonal lull, but we are approaching August. Historically, demand for jeans often begins a 'back-to-school' recovery in late August and September. Current demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 86.8 units/period, showing a slight uptick from the June bottom (~60). Although inventory levels are high (210 on-hand), the lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders placed today (Aug 5) won't arrive until early September (Period 30). I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand level, while keeping L at 'default' (4) as shipments have been consistent. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the high-variance spring peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans) is showing signs of recovery from the summer seasonal lull. The last three periods (P24-P26) have seen demand of 52, 99, and 137, indicating an upward trend as we approach the 'back-to-school' season. The mean demand over the last 5 periods is 96.6, but the most recent period reached 137. Total pipeline inventory is 337 (73 on-hand + 264 in-transit), which covers approximately 2.5 periods at the current peak demand of 137. Given the 4-period lead time, we must prepare for continued seasonal growth. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend while maintaining stability, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school recovery detected: Demand increased for three consecutive periods (P24: 52, P25: 99, P26: 137), suggesting the end of the summer lull and the start of a seasonal climb.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans) is entering the back-to-school and autumn recovery phase. We have seen four consecutive periods of demand growth: P24 (52), P25 (99), P26 (137), and P27 (183). This clearly demonstrates a shift from the summer lull (avg ~60-80) back toward higher mid-year levels. Period 27 ending on-hand inventory is 0, and we saw lost sales (demand 183 vs. 83 sold), indicating our previous logic was too conservative. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward trajectory, I will use a short lookback (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture this acceleration (avg ~140, but P27 was already 183), which the backend will scale by (1+L)=5. I will also use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. This setup aims to aggressively restock to meet the autumn demand climb and prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Autumn demand recovery confirmed: Demand increased for four consecutive periods (P24-P27) rising from 52 to 183 units (+250% from summer bottom).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a significant back-to-school/Autumn demand recovery. Demand has increased for five consecutive periods (P24: 52 to P28: 187). The product, 'Womens Everyday Collection skinny jeans', is highly seasonal and typically sees a sustained peak during the late-August to October period. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in the last two periods. The recent 3-period demand average is 169 units, up from the summer bottom of ~60. To capture this upward trend while accounting for the high volatility of seasonal shifts, I will use mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the recent acceleration (P25-P28: 99, 137, 183, 187). Sigma_hat is set using the same window to capture the increased volatility of this recovery phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery accelerating: Demand increased from 52 (P24) to 187 (P28), with the last two periods exceeding 180 units. This marks the end of the summer lull and the beginning of the Autumn peak regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for denim jeans is in a strong 'Back-to-School/Autumn' recovery phase. Period 29 demand (163) and Period 28 (187) confirm we have exited the summer lull (avg ~60-80) and are likely returning to a regime similar to the Spring peak (avg ~200-240). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time is stable at 4 periods. With a lead time of 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the current trajectory and historical performance of this SKU during its last peak (March/April), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the upward momentum (P25-P29 mean: 136.2) while acknowledging that the next few periods are expected to be higher than this average. I will use recent_N for sigma to account for the increasing volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery confirmed: Demand averaged 162.3 over the last 3 periods (P27-P29), up from the summer bottom of ~60. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 (denim jeans) is experiencing a sharp seasonal recovery characteristic of late summer/early autumn (back-to-school). Demand has surged from a summer low of ~60 to 300 in Period 30. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P28-P30) is 216.7. With on-hand inventory at 0 due to the rapid demand increase, we are relying entirely on the pipeline (713 units). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. To capture the current upward momentum and ensure the service level for the upcoming autumn peak, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most current demand regime of ~217 units/period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the high volatility (163 to 300) observed during this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand surge confirmed: Demand reached 300 units in P30, with a 3-period average (P28-P30) of 216.7 units, effectively returning to Spring peak levels.

=== Period 31 Summary ===
562245046: ordered=338, arrived=150 units (ordered on Period 27, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=150, demand=349, sold=150, ending on-hand inventory=0

Daily Reward (R_t): $600.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (denim jeans) is in a sharp Autumn/Back-to-School surge, with Period 31 demand reaching 349 units, continuing the upward trajectory from Period 30's 300 units. This mirrors the Spring peak levels and confirms a significant regime shift from the summer lull. The current 3-period average (P29-P31) is 270.7 units. Given the velocity of the increase and historical peaks, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this momentum. I will also use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility associated with high-demand periods. We are currently out of stock (on-hand = 0), so aggressive ordering is necessary to meet the L+1 demand window. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School peak confirmed: Demand has surged for three consecutive periods exceeding 200 units (P29: 163, P30: 300, P31: 349), establishing a high-demand regime similar to the Spring peak (~260-300 units).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for denim jeans is currently in a high-demand Autumn/Back-to-school peak. Recent demand observations for Periods 30, 31, and 32 are 300, 349, and 354 units respectively. This represents a sustained regime shift significantly higher than the summer lull and comparable to or exceeding the Spring peak. The average demand over the last 3 periods (N=3) is 334.3 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a substantial pipeline of 1122 units. Given the inventory position and the clear upward trajectory, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to catch the peak and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the high volatility (std dev) associated with these larger volumes. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time + current period (L+1=5) at this new high-demand level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Demand for the last 3 periods (P30-P32) averaged 334.3 units, exceeding the Spring peak average (~260) and marking a 448% increase from the summer bottom (~61 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $884.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245046' (denim jeans) is experiencing an intense Autumn/Back-to-School demand surge. Period 33 demand spiked to 709 units, more than double the previous week's record high of 354. This suggests a significant seasonal peak (likely late-September/early-October shopping). Current on-hand inventory is 0, while pipeline inventory is 1285 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the massive jump in Period 33, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat to account for this new peak (averaging the extreme spike with the preceding high-demand weeks) to ensure the OR backend places sufficiently large orders to recover from stockouts while the surge lasts. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~400 units per period over the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified significantly: Period 33 demand reached 709 units, a 100% increase over the previous 3-period average (~334), establishing a new high-volatility regime for late September.

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 562245046 (skinny jeans) has entered an intense autumn peak, with recent demand reaching extreme levels (P33: 709, P34: 448). This follows the typical 'Back-to-School' and 'Fall' clothing cycle seen in the garment industry. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and despite a large pipeline in-transit (1885 units), recent stockouts indicate that our base stock needs were underestimated due to the sudden volume increase. Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), average demand is ~430 units, compared to ~334 units in the period prior. The 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 will capture this current regime (~430 units/period). For sigma_hat, recent_N with N=5 is chosen to capture the significant increase in volatility (standard deviation) associated with these high-volume spikes. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P30-P34). Setting these parameters allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of this high-demand regime while the capped policy prevents over-ordering if this is a momentary spike.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand regime intensified (P30-P34): average demand increased to 430 units/period, with a significant spike of 709 units in P33. Previous autumn recovery average was ~216.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for denim jeans (SKU 562245046) has entered a high-volatility Autumn peak regime. Period 33 demand spiked to 709 units, followed by 448 (P34) and 375 (P35). Over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged approximately 447 units. The 3-period average (P33-P35) remains even higher at 510 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stockout situation (on-hand 0 for several periods) and the significant demand increase compared to the summer lull, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the full scope of the Autumn peak, resulting in a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~447 units) across 5 periods (L+1). I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the elevated volatility (Standard Deviation ~150+) observed during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) averaged 447 units/period, with a significant maximum of 709 (P33), establishing a higher-volume and higher-volatility regime compared to the Spring peak (~260).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 is currently in a high-demand Autumn peak regime (Date: 2019/10/21). Analysis of the last 5 periods (P32-P36) shows a mean demand of 435.8 units/period with significant volatility (standard deviation ~160, largely driven by the P33 spike of 709). Although demand in the most recent period (P36) was lower at 293 units, the overall regime remains significantly elevated compared to both the Summer lull (~61) and Spring peak (~260). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 137 and a large pipeline (In-transit: 2091), the goal is to maintain the base stock to cover demand during the lead time + review period (5 periods total). I will use the last 5 periods (regime_length = 5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current high-volume, high-variance behavior while preventing over-ordering if the peak is starting to subside. Since N must be at least 3 and we have 5 periods of this clear regime, N=5 is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1029.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the late Autumn season (late October). Historical demand peaked significantly in late September (P33: 709) and has since stabilized at a high levels (P36: 293, P37: 310). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is approximately 427 units, though this is heavily skewed by the P33 outlier. Excluding the outlier, the underlying high-regime demand is closer to 300-350 units. On-hand inventory is 211, and we have a very large pipeline of 1964 units due to aggressive ordering during the peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given that we are past the initial Autumn surge and demand is showing signs of moderate stabilization, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the high-regime average while smoothing the P33 spike. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen during this peak season. This approach ensures we maintain a sufficient base stock for the current high-demand regime while the OR backend's capping mechanism prevents over-ordering against the already substantial pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand has stabilized at a high level following the late September surge; average demand (excluding P33 spike) is approximately 320 units/period (P34-P37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for 'Luna skinny RW' jeans is in a high-volume Autumn/Winter regime. Over the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 381.6 units, reflecting significant volatility (ranging from 293 to 482). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 462 units, and the pipeline is robust at 1510 units (orders from P35-P38). To maintain high service levels during this volatile peak season while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current high-demand average (approx 381.6 * 5 = 1908 for mu_hat calculation). Sigma is set with 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the increased variance observed in October. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the sustained high demand and the high volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand regime (P34-P38) average has moved to 381.6 units/period, with high volatility (Standard Deviation approx 80).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), we are in the high-demand Autumn/Winter season for denim jeans. Demand has stabilized at a high level with significant volatility; the average over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 349.6 units, while the longer-term Autumn average (P30-P39) is 385.4 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilization at ~350 units. Standard deviation remains high (approx 78 over the last 5 periods), so I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to ensure adequate safety stock for the high-volatility environment and the 80% service level target (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)). Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P31-P35 orders all arrived with L=4).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand has settled into a high-volume, high-volatility regime averaging ~350-385 units/period (P30-P39). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, approaching the holiday season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Demand for denim jeans has remained high and volatile, averaging 349.4 units per period over the last 10 periods (P31-P40). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P36-P40) show a slight cooling from the late September peak, averaging 332.4 units, but still significantly higher than summer or spring levels. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory (864) plus in-transit (748) totals 1,612 units, which is slightly above the expected demand for the (L+1) window (approx. 5 * 332 = 1,660). Given we are entering the peak retail weeks of late November, I will maintain a high demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 10 periods to capture the volatility (sigma_hat) and volume of the autumn regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a robust base stock for potential holiday shopping spikes.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season entry: Demand remains in a high-volume autumn regime (avg ~350, P31-P40) with significant volatility (std ~135) as we enter the late November retail peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the late November retail peak (Period 42: 2019/11/25). Demand has been high and stable over the last five periods (P37-P41), averaging 307 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 98. Although the previous 'Autumn peak' (P33-P34) saw spikes up to 709, the recent regime is more consistent. With on-hand inventory at 840 and a pipeline of 1072, we are well-positioned. The lead time continues to be exceptionally stable at 4 periods. Given we are in the week of Cyber Monday/Black Friday, I will shift the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the recent 5-period average (N=5) to ensure the base stock captures the current high-volume level, while using the last 5 periods (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the sustained volatility observed in the autumn/holiday transition.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (late Nov): Average demand stabilized at ~307 units (P37-P41) with high volatility (std ~98) compared to the summer lows.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019 (Period 43). Period 42 showed a massive demand spike to 999 units, confirming a major retail peak (Black Friday/Cyber Monday week). This spike depleted on-hand inventory to 120 units. With lead time stable at 4 periods, order projections must account for this heightened volatility and volume. While demand may stay elevated for the holiday season, the 999 spike is likely the absolute peak. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the transition into the holiday peak) to capture the higher mean (~430 units/period) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the extreme variance observed recently. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 999 units (Black Friday), a 225% increase over the previous 4-period average (approx 307).

Daily Reward (R_t): $852.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the December holiday season (Period 44). Period 42 saw a massive demand spike of 999 (Black Friday), followed by 922 in Period 43, indicating sustained high demand. Historical data for this Women's denim SKU suggests that the peak extends through early December. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the small arrival from Period 39 (93 units) was insufficient for the 922 demand. Our pipeline (in-transit) is 1604 units. Looking ahead at arrivals: P44 expects 119 (P40 order), P45 expects 581 (P41 order), P46 expects 0 (P42 order), and P47 expects 904 (P43 order). The shortage in P43 and the gap in expected arrivals for P46 create a risk of stockouts during the holiday peak. I will use 'explicit' methods to project a mean demand of 750 units/period for the (L+1) horizon, reflecting the sustained high volume observed in the last two periods, while maintaining high volatility (sigma_hat=300) to account for holiday shopping swings. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed: Sustained demand >900 units/period observed across P42 (999) and P43 (922).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final weeks of the year (mid-December), following the massive Black Friday/early December peak (P42 demand: 999, P43: 922). Period 44 saw a sharp drop to 210, which likely marks the post-peak normalization before any potential secondary Christmas/End-of-Year clearance surge. With the game ending in Period 47, we have 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47). There are 2729 units currently in-transit, which includes the large orders from P41 (581), P43 (904), and P44 (1244). The order from P41 (581 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 45 resolution phase. Given the extreme volatility and the shift from the ~900+ regime back down to 210, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to blend the high-peak periods with the recent drop. sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the high variance observed during the holiday season (~350-400) to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock to capture any final year-end demand spikes without being overly penalized by holding costs on the massive pipeline already arriving.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization detected in Period 44 (demand 210) following the late Nov/early Dec peak (averaging ~960 in P42-43).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for denim jeans has entered a post-holiday normalization phase after the late November peak (P42: 999, P43: 922). Demand in P44 (210) and P45 (245) indicates a return to the pre-holiday Autumn regime, which averaged approximately 350-380 units/period (P34-P38). Given the date is Dec 23rd, 2019, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease as the primary gift-buying season concludes and transitions into the post-Christmas/New Year lull. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With a massive in-transit pipeline (3138 units) from large orders placed during the peak (P43: 904, P44: 1244, P45: 990), there is a significant risk of overstocking if demand continues to soften. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the volatility of the peak-to-post-peak transition while acknowledging the high inventory already in transit. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N 5 to account for the extreme variance observed during the Black Friday/Holiday surge.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization: Demand dropped from a peak of ~960 (P42-P43) to an average of 227.5 (P44-P45), returning towards the high-autumn regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $534.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-holiday normalization phase following the Black Friday/Early December peak (averaging ~960 units in P42-P43). Demand has dropped to an average of ~210 units over the last three periods (P44-P46). Historically, the lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. However, we observe a fulfillment gap: order P42 (placed 11/25) should have arrived during P46 (12/23) but 'arrived=0' was reported in the P46 conclude message. This suggests a potential 1-period delay or a bottleneck during the late December period. I will set L to 'explicit' at 5 to account for this observed delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers the additional period of risk. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent normalization level (approx 210 units/period) rather than the extreme holiday spikes. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=6 to include both the high-volatility peak and the subsequent drop, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety buffer during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Lead time delay observed: Order P42 (ordered Period 42) did not arrive in Period 46 as expected (actual lead time > 4 periods).
