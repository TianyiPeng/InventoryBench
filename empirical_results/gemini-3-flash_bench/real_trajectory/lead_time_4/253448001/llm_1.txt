While it has some seasonal peaks around Valentine's Day (which is February 14th, during this period), it generally sees steady demand. b) Demand Analysis: Historical data for the past 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows demand ranging from 39 to 70 units, with a mean of 56. I expect a slight uptick this week due to the Valentine's Day calendar event. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. With an order placed in P1, I expect it to arrive at the start of P5 (decision P6). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. I need to cover demand for periods 1 through 5 (L+1 = 5 periods). e) Forecast: Using a mean of 56 and accounting for a potential Valentine's peak, I'll estimate demand at ~60 per period. To cover 5 periods (P1-P5) and leave a small safety stock, I need approximately 300-340 units in the pipeline.",

While the previous insight noted a shift to ~33, Period 8 saw a significant jump to 55.

I need to cover demand for Period 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 (the arrival of today's order).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are in Period 43 of 47. The product is a push-up bra, which typically sees stable demand but experienced a significant peak in August. Current demand has returned to a stable autumn level with a slight uptick in late November (P41-P42 average: 51.5 units), likely due to pre-Christmas shopping. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 178 units. With 5 periods remaining (P43, P44, P45, P46, P47), and an estimated average demand of ~52 units (recovering slightly from the autumn low), the total required inventory to cover the remaining game is approximately 260 units (52 * 5). However, any order placed now (P43) would arrive in P47, covering only that final period's demand. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the fact that we have 178 units on hand (enough to cover ~3.4 periods of demand at recent rates), ordering more would likely result in unnecessary holding costs for units that won't be sold before the game ends. The priority now is to clear the remaining stock to maximize ending profit.",

Period 44 (2019/12/9) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The game ends at Period 47. We are currently at the start of Period 44. The order placed now (Period 44) with a lead time of 4 periods would arrive at the start of Period 48 (due to the 4-period lead time + 1-period observation delay mechanism), which is after the game has concluded. Therefore, any order placed now or in the future will only incur costs without the possibility of generating revenue. Current on-hand inventory is 158 units. The average demand over the recent stable period (P31-P43) is approximately 34.6 units per period. With only 4 periods of demand remaining (P44, P45, P46, and P47), total expected demand is roughly 138 units (34.6 * 4). Our current inventory of 158 units is sufficient to cover this demand. Since Profit ($4) is only 4x the Holding Cost ($1) and we are liquidating, maintaining any additional safety stock through new orders is economically counterproductive.",

Therefore, ordering more stock is physiologically impossible to impact sales and would only incur unnecessary holding costs if it were to arrive. My current on-hand inventory is 113 units. Based on the demand regime identified over the last several weeks (averaging ~42 units over P41-P44), I have enough stock to satisfy demand for the remaining 3 periods (45, 46, and 47) even if a slight spike occurs. My primary goal now is to deplete existing inventory to minimize holding costs at the end of the simulation.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 46 of 47, which is the penultimate period of the simulation. The simulation concludes after Period 47's demand resolution. Any order placed now in Period 46 with a lead time of 4 periods would not arrive until Period 50, which is well beyond the end of the simulation. Therefore, no additional inventory can be acquired to satisfy the remaining demand. We must rely entirely on the current on-hand inventory of 48 units. Historically, demand for this microfibre push-up bra has averaged around 33-35 units since the autumn drop-off (Period 31 onwards), with recent fluctuations between 20 and 65 units (P41: 45, P42: 58, P43: 20, P44: 45, P45: 65). Given there are only two demand phases left (Period 46 and Period 47), and we already have 48 units on hand, there is no benefit to ordering. The inventory strategy is now purely focused on minimizing ending inventory to avoid unnecessary holding costs, as arrivals are impossible before the game ends.",

{
  "rationale": "We are currently in the final period of the game (Period 47). The game ends at the conclusion of this period. Placing an order now would be illogical because any order placed in Period 47 would not arrive until Period 51 (given the 4-period lead time), which is well past the game's horizon. Period 46 ended with 0 inventory after a high demand of 71 units, which exhausted the remaining stock. Historically, the period after Christmas/pre-New Year (late December) often sees a cleanup of seasonal stock or moderate demand; however, since there is no inventory left and no way to replenish it before the simulation ends, the only action is to place an order of 0 to avoid unnecessary costs or inventory holding charges if the simulation were to extend (though it won't).",
