Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is a basic jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) has been [54, 36, 43, 32, 55], resulting in a mean of 44 and a standard deviation of approximately 10.4. Since this is the first period and on-hand inventory is 0, we need to establish a baseline order. The promised lead time is 4. Given the nature of 'Divided Basics' jersey t-shirts, demand is relatively stable but can fluctuate slightly. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the most recent pre-game demand characteristics. For lead time, I will start with 'default' (promised L=4). mu_hat calculation by OR backend will be (1+4)*44 = 220. sigma_hat will be sqrt(1+4)*10.4 \u2248 23.25.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the SKU '717490015' (T-shirt in soft jersey), the historical demand provided (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 44 units (54, 36, 43, 32, 55). In Period 1 (starting Feb 11), the demand was 41, which matches the existing regime. Current on-hand is 0 because the order placed in Period 1 (62 units) is in-transit (promised lead time is 4). Since current demand is stable and there is no seasonality spike yet for basic jersey T-shirts in mid-February, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent stable mean and standard deviation. N is set to 6 (the 5 historical samples + Period 1 demand). For lead time, I will use the default promised lead time of 4 until arrival confirmation suggests otherwise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' in the 'Divided Basics' category, which typically sees stable but slightly increasing demand as spring approaches. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 44 units. However, observed demand in P1 (41) and P2 (73) suggests a potential upward shift or high volatility (avg = 57). Inventory is currently 0 because orders have a promised lead time of 4 periods, meaning the P1 order should arrive in P5. The backend OR calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, leading to z* = 0. We must ensure mu_hat covers demand for (L+1) periods (4+1=5). Based on recent demand (P1:41, P2:73) and historical data, an average demand around 50-55 is reasonable. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent samples (including P1 and P2) while smoothed by the historical tail. For L, I will stick to 'default' as we haven't reached the first expected delivery yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Cat Tee' is a basic jersey T-shirt. Historically (pre-game), demand averaged ~44 units/week. Since the game started, demand has surged: 41 (P1), 73 (P2), and 82 (P3), likely due to seasonal transition into spring. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have only completed 3 periods, no orders placed within the game should have arrived yet (P1 order is expected in P5). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 196 units in-transit (62+59+75). Because current demand (avg ~65 over last 3 weeks) is significantly higher than pre-game (avg ~44), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this upward shift for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time (L), I will stick with the promised 'default' of 4 until we have arrival data to verify actual performance.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a Cat Tee (Jersey Basic), which typically sees a demand increase as spring approaches in March. Historical demand samples (Pre-period 1) averaged 44 units/week. However, observed demand in Periods 1-4 has been 41, 73, 82, and 50 (average 61.5). The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4. An order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible in Period 6). I will maintain the promised lead time of 4. Since the demand shows a slight upward trend compared to the initial samples (potentially seasonal for spring), I will use the recent 4 periods of observed demand to set mu_hat. This ensures we are accounting for the recent higher demand (avg ~62) rather than the older lower samples (avg ~44). Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on these recent 4 periods to capture the increased volatility (ranging from 41 to 82).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows a slight upward trend compared to the initial 5 samples (P1-P5 demand: 41, 73, 82, 50, 50; avg ~59 vs. pre-game avg ~44). The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 12 units, and we have significant pipeline inventory (246 units) from orders placed in P2-P5. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's critical ratio q = 0.5, which targets a 50% service level. My parameters aim to stabilize the order flow based on recent demand. I will use N=5 for demand (recent regime) and N=3 for lead time (since we only have one observation so far, but it matches the promise). mu_hat will be estimated from the 5 periods of gameplay data.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU is a 'T-shirt in soft jersey', a basic garment item. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has fluctuated between 32 and 82 units. Recent periods (P1-P6) show a mean demand of approximately 62 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and so far, the actual arrivals (P5 and P6) have matched this precisely (4 periods). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, with 225 units in-transit. The in-transit units are: P3 (75), P4 (101), P5 (11), and P6 (38). Based on the lead time of 4, the P3 order (75 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 7. Demand is relatively stable but high relative to current supply; I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For lead time, 'default' is sufficient as observed lead times match promised.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (observed P1 and P2 orders arrived in P5 and P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a basic jersey t-shirt. Reviewing historical demand: Period 1-4 averaged ~61.5 units/week, while Period 6-7 saw a significant increase to 76 and 91 units respectively. This suggests a seasonal uptick as we enter spring/summer (April). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 235 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4, which has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7. Since demand is showing a clear upward trend (Mean of last 3 periods is ~72.3, last 2 is ~83.5), I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this growth while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen in recent weeks compared to the earlier quiet period.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019/04/08). History confirms the actual lead time is 4 periods (as promised), with orders from P1-P4 arriving exactly in P5-P8. The product is a 'Cat Tee' (Jersey Basic), which typically sees stable demand but can be influenced by early spring seasonality. Observed demand in the last 8 periods has averaged 66.25 units, showing a slight increase from the initial pre-game samples (avg 44). However, recent periods (P6-P8) have shown higher volatility and higher mean (mean=78.3) compared to the start of the game. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent lift (P4-P8 mean is 67, which is a safe middle ground) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for recent fluctuations. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as the observed 4-period lead time matches the promised duration.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt, which typically sees rising demand as spring progresses toward summer. Historical demand samples (54, 36, 43, 32, 55) and recent period demand (P1-P9: 41, 73, 82, 50, 50, 76, 91, 68, 57) show a mean of roughly 62 units/period, but with considerable volatility and an upward trend in the last few weeks (avg 72 over the last 4 weeks). Pipeline inventory is 291 units, with on-hand currently at 0 due to a stockout in Period 9. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the product type and the timing (mid-April), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the higher recent demand levels while setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods. This should help the OR engine set a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the recent demand acceleration.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a jersey basic T-shirt, which typically sees stable but slightly increasing demand as spring progresses toward summer. Historical demand samples (before simulation) averaged 44 units, but simulation demand (last 10 periods) has increased significantly to an average of 65.5 units, with a peak of 91. The service level target is 50% (Profit = Holding Cost), so balancing stockouts and holding costs is vital. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P1-P6 orders all arrived at L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after several stockouts. The inventory pipeline is 304 units: Period 7 (85), Period 8 (104), Period 9 (64), and Period 10 (51). The Period 7 order (85 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 11) and should satisfy current demand. I will use the recent demand regime (last 10 periods) to forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the recent mean (65.5) is noticeably higher than the initial samples (44).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift identified: Simulation demand (P1-P10) averages 65.5 units, a 48% increase over initial pre-simulation samples (avg 44). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (April 29, 2019). Analyzing the history, demand from P1 to P11 has averaged approximately 67 units per period, which is significantly higher than the pre-simulation average of 44. This confirms the regime shift noted in Period 11. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, ..., P7 arrived P11). In the last period (P11), the P7 order of 85 units arrived, leaving 3 units on-hand. We have 243 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Given the product is a staple T-shirt ('Jersey Basic') and the dates are moving into late spring/early summer, demand is expected to remain high or slightly increase due to seasonality. To capture the current demand regime while smoothing out weekly volatility, I will use recent_N with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use calculate for L as the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/06. Historical demand since Period 1 shows a mean of 68.1 units, significantly higher than the pre-simulation average of 44. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P7-P12) shows an even higher sustained average of 79.1 units (80, 82, 67, 57, 68, 91), indicating a strong upward trend or shift in the 'Divided Basics' jersey t-shirt category as spring/summer peaks approach. The lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods (orders from P1 through P8 all arrived in L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 27, and in-transit inventory is 228 (consisting of orders from P9: 64, P10: 51, P11: 24, P12: 89). The order from P9 (64 units) is expected to arrive this period (P13). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level (q=0.5). To capture the recent demand level while accounting for the seasonal upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to cover the simulation period (P3-P12) and setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14. Historical analysis of the simulation periods (P1-P13) shows a demand regime significantly higher than the initial pre-simulation samples, with a simulation average of 63.3 units/period (compared to 44 initially). However, Period 13 saw a sharp drop to 26 units. While this could be a random fluctuation, it may signal the start of a cooling period after a high-demand phase. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1 through 9. Currently, 'In-transit' inventory is 258 units, covering orders from P10-P13. To maintain stability while acknowledging the recent high average but potential volatility (P13 drop), I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) set to N=13 to capture the full simulation regime, and 'recent_N' for L to capitalize on the confirmed actual lead time stability. Sigma_hat will also use the last 13 periods to capture the recent variance increase.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: The product is a basic jersey T-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 76, with 209 in-transit. Demand analysis: Early simulation periods (P1-P12) showed a higher average demand around 69 units. However, recent periods (P13 and P14) have shown a significant drop to 26 and 40 units respectively. This could indicate a cooling off after a spring peak or general volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P5 through P14). Since demand appears to be shifting again or becoming more volatile, I will use a recent window (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the higher levels seen in late April with the lower levels seen in May, providing a safer buffer while awaiting more data points to confirm if the recent drop is a new sustained low regime. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is currently reliable.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt'. Historically, demand shifted at Period 1 from an average of 44 to 65.5. However, the last three periods (P13-P15) have seen demand of 26, 40, and 72, averaging 46. This suggests a potential cooldown from the mid-spring peak as we enter late May, or simply high volatility. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 28 plus 195 in-transit (orders from P12-P15). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, aiming to meet the mean demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (averaging P11-P15 demand) to capture the recent high volatility and potential downward trend, yielding a base stock that covers (1 + L) periods of demand. This balances the risk of stockouts against the high holding costs seen in recent periods (P13-P14).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Jersey T-shirt, which typically sees steady demand in June (P17). Reviewing the historical demand during the simulation (P1-P16), the average is 64.1 units, which aligns with the demand regime shift noted in Period 11 (avg 65.5). However, demand has shown some volatility recently (low of 26 in P13, high of 72 in P15). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 56 and in-transit units at 183 (covering orders from P13-P16), we are well-positioned for the immediate future. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand behavior since the identified regime shift, while keeping the lead time at the default promised/observed value of 4.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 18 (June 10th). Analyzing historical demand from the simulation start (Period 1 to Period 17), the average demand is 62.5 units per period. Recent data (last 5 periods) shows a slight cooling to 48.2 units, though this follows a high-demand period in late April/early May. The product is a jersey t-shirt, consistent with steady summer demand. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 108 and in-transit at 172, we have 280 units covering the next 5 periods (pipeline inventory). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we aim for the base stock to match mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). To normalize against recent fluctuations while acknowledging the overall higher regime since Period 1, I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat (which includes periods 8-17, averaging 56.4 units) and recent_N=10 for the volatility estimate to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient buffer without over-ordering during the current slight dip.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (June 17), we are managing a basic Cat Tee. The demand regime identified at Period 11 (mean ~65.5) has cooled significantly over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), averaging only 46.3 units/period, which is closer to the pre-simulation baseline. This drop coincides with the transition from Spring into early Summer. Lead times have remained perfectly stable at 4 periods across all 14 concluded order cycles. On-hand inventory is healthy (73), and we have 188 units in the pipeline. Given the recent softening of demand, I am using a recent_N window (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower demand level (approx 46/week) and avoid over-ordering, while maintaining the L=4 based on consistent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Average demand decreased from 65.5 (P1-P12) to 46.3 (P13-P18), aligning back with pre-simulation levels as seasonality shifts into mid-June.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical demand shows a regime shift starting around Period 13 (early May), where average demand dropped. Demand from P13 to P19 has averaged 48.7 units (26, 40, 72, 61, 42, 37, 63). This is lower than the peak seen in March/April but consistent with the pre-simulation baseline for this 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt SKU. Recent demand is somewhat volatile (\u03c3 \u2248 16), which we must account for. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting parameters to reflect this recent lower-demand regime (N=7) ensures the base stock calculation, covering (L+1) periods, is grounded in current seasonal trends without over-ordering as we move through summer. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that accounts for on-hand (20) and in-transit (178) inventory, ensuring the service level is balanced against holding costs.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 21 (July 1st). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since Period 13, a demand regime shift was identified with a lower mean compared to the spring peak. Analyzing demand from Period 13 to Period 20, the average is (26+40+72+61+42+37+63+61)/8 = 50.25 units. The most recent demand samples from June (Periods 17-20) are [42, 37, 63, 61], averaging 50.75. This suggests that the drop reported in the carry-over insight (Period 19) has stabilized around ~51 units per week. For Period 21, being early July, we expect steady summer demand for t-shirts. I will use recent_N with N=8 (covering the current regime since P13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized demand. Lead time (L) remains 'default' at 4 periods as observed consistently.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, we experienced a massive demand spike (151 units), which is the highest observed to date and significantly exceeds the previous demand regime average of ~46 units. This spike on 2019/07/01 likely correlates with early July summer sales or holiday events. The on-hand inventory was completely depleted. Total in-transit is 133 units (ordered in Periods 18-21: 18, 0, 46, 69). The Period 18 order (18 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 22, while the Period 19 order (0 units) means no arrival in Period 23. To prevent stockouts against this new volatility, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to focus on the most recent 9 periods (P13-P21), which includes the lower June regime and this new July spike, providing a more responsive but tempered forecast compared to using only the spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand volatility detected starting Period 21: Demand spiked to 151 (+226% over previous regime avg).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime triggered by summer seasonality (July), with demand spiking from an average of ~46 units (P13-P20) to 151 (P21) and 187 (P22). This represents a +300% increase. The product description (Cat Tee / Jersey T-shirt) confirms summer peak relevance. Although On-hand inventory is 0, there is a total pipeline of 237 units (orders from P19-P22). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Because the demand shift is extremely recent and severe (only 2 data points), but clearly seasonal, I will use recent_N=2 to capture this spike in Mu_hat and Sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the new levels. This will raise the base stock target drastically to recover from the current stockout and match the ~170/week demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for July: P21-P22 average demand is 169 units, a 265% increase over the P13-P20 average of 46 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand peak period (July seasonality for a jersey T-shirt). Demand in the last three periods (P21-P23) has been 151, 187, and 150, averaging 162.7 units per week. This is a massive increase (+250%) over the spring/June average of ~46 units. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand inventory is 0 for P21, P22, and P23). The shipment from P19 (0 units ordered) arrived as 0, which further exacerbated the stockout in P23. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on this new high-demand regime (N=3) to ensure the OR backend increases base stock levels significantly to capture the July surge. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect the increased volatility during this peak.

Carry-over insight: July peak demand confirmed (P21-P23): average demand increased to 162.7 units (from ~46 in previous regime). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a July high-demand regime for 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which is expected given the summer seasonality. The average demand over the last four periods (P21-P24) is 154.25 units, significantly higher than the previous spring/June levels (~46-65). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for P21-P24) because the orders placed before this spike were based on lower historical demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P20 order arrived in P24). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a massive pipeline (600 units) triggered by recent high orders, we must continue to signal the OR backend to maintain a high base stock to capture this peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the specific July spike (avg 154.25 * 5 = 771.25) and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility (std dev of ~24 * sqrt(5) \u2248 54). L is set to 'default' as 4 periods remains accurate.

Carry-over insight: July high-demand peak sustained: Period 21-24 demand average is 154.25 units, confirming a shift from previous average of 46 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490015' (Cat Tee) had a significant demand spike in July (P21-P24), averaging ~154 units. However, Period 25 (July 29) shows a drop to 80 units, suggesting the peak summer demand may be tapering off as we enter August. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline (703 units) following heavy ordering during the July peak. To avoid significant overstocking while demand transitions, I will reduce the forecast. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat, covering the tail end of the July peak and the recent drop (P21-P25 avg ~119), which sets mu_hat to (1+4) * 119 = 595. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 5 periods to capture high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed at Period 25: Demand dropped from July peak avg (~154) to 80 units (-48%) as the calendar moves into August.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 27 (mid-August), the model detects a clear tapering in demand following the July seasonal peak. July (Periods 21\u201324) averaged ~154 units, while the first two weeks of August (Periods 25\u201326) have dropped to 80 and 82 units respectively, representing a nearly 50% decline. The product is a basic jersey T-shirt, which typically sees high summer demand through July and stabilizes or dips as the school season approaches. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high in-transit volume (581 units) resulting from peak-season orders (P23: 211, P24: 198, P25: 172) that will start arriving in Period 27/28, there is a significant risk of overstocking if parameters aren't adjusted downward immediately. I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 2 periods to reflect this lower demand regime (~81 per period) and calculating metrics across (L+1)=5 periods. This will signal the OR backend to stop ordering, as the pipeline inventory far exceeds the current demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed for August: Period 25-26 demand averaged 81 units, down from the July peak average of 154 units (-47%).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late August (2019/08/19). Historical consumption patterns show a significant tapering compared to the July peak. The high-demand July period (P21-P24) averaged ~154 units. Since Period 25 (Late July/August), demand has dropped to an average of 78 units (80, 82, 72). This confirms a new regime for August. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 179 units on-hand and 370 units in-transit (P24: 198, P25: 172), we have a total of 549 units covering the lead time window. Given the current demand average of ~78 units, 549 units covers approximately 7 periods of demand, which is sufficient for the L+1 (5 period) requirement. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the August tapering, and L as default (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-243.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic jersey T-shirt. Historically, we saw a significant peak in July (Periods 21-24, averaging ~154 units) which has now tapered off in August. Current data from Periods 25-28 shows demand levels of 80, 82, 72, and 67, averaging 75.25 units per period. This confirms the August tapering identified in carry-over insights. We are currently overstocked (On-hand: 310) because large orders placed during the July peak (Periods 23-24) arrived after demand had already dropped. With a lead time of 4, the target inventory (base stock) should cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent average of ~75 units, we need approximately 375 units to cover the pipeline. We currently have 310 on-hand and 172 in-transit, totaling 482 units, which is already above the required level. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the lower August demand level. This will signal the OR backend to stop ordering until the current excess inventory is depleted, balancing the holding cost against the lower projected demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late August: Period 25-28 demand average is 75.3 units, down from July peak of ~154 units (-51%). Current inventory levels are high due to lagged arrivals of peak-period orders.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering September (Period 30). Demand has shifted from a July peak (~154 units/week) to an August average of 69.5 units/week (Periods 25-29). This aligns with the 'Divided Basics' T-shirt category tapering after summer. Current on-hand inventory is very high (425 units) because peak-period orders (placed in July) have arrived while demand was falling. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand balance and the downward demand trend, the focus is on clearing inventory to minimize holding costs while setting a conservative restock level for the autumn baseline. I will use the last 5 periods (August data) to define the new demand regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to avoid over-ordering based on the July outlier spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for September: average demand for August (P25-P29) settled at 71.6 units, a significant decrease from the July peak of 154 units. High on-hand inventory (425) suggests no new ordering is required for several periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early September (2019/09/09). Following the significant July demand peak (avg ~154), demand has stabilized in a lower regime for August and early September. Specifically, demand from Period 25 to 30 has averaged 66.5 units (80, 82, 72, 67, 57, 38), showing a steady downward trend as we move further into the post-summer season. Our current on-hand inventory is very high at 387 units due to the arrival of large orders placed during the July peak (Periods 23-25). With current demand around 40-70 units per period, this stock will cover approximately 5-8 periods of demand. No new orders have been placed since Period 25, and there is no in-transit inventory remaining. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My parameters aim to prevent any further ordering until the current surplus is liquidated. I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 6 periods (August/early September regime) to reflect this lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed September demand regime: Average demand for P25-P30 has dropped to 66.5 units (from the July peak of 154). Inventory surplus from July orders is being liquidated.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-September (Period 32). The demand for this SKU (Jersey Basic T-shirt) has transitioned from its July peak (~154 units/week) into a lower autumn regime. Over the last 5 periods (P27-P31), demand has averaged 55.8 units, which is consistent with early-year and mid-June levels as seasonal demand for light t-shirts cools. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Our primary concern is the significant inventory surplus (342 units on-hand) resulting from large orders placed during the July peak that arrived as demand started to taper. With a holding cost equal to profit ($1.00), minimizing excess stock is critical. Given the current average demand of ~56 units, the 342 units on-hand cover approximately 6 periods of demand, which is more than the cycle length (L+1 = 5). Therefore, we will continue a policy of no new ordering by using 'recent_N' parameters that reflect current lower demand, allowing the OR engine's base-stock calculation to stay well below the 342 on-hand + 0 in-transit units. I am choosing N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent downward trend and stabilization since late August.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a post-peak seasonal phase. After a significant demand spike in July (average ~154 units), demand has stabilized in August and September. The current demand regime (Periods 30-32) shows an average of 39 units per period (38, 45, 34). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 308 units due to large orders placed during the July peak that arrived during the August slowdown. With a current demand rate of approximately 40 units/period and a lead time of 4 periods, the total inventory required to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 200 units. Since current on-hand inventory (308) significantly exceeds this requirement and there is no pending in-transit pipeline, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) to capture the stabilized late-summer/early-autumn demand level, allowing the OR backend to naturally suppress ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized: Average demand for P30-P32 is 39 units, confirming a return to baseline levels following the July peak and August taper. High inventory surplus remains from late-July peak orders.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a low-volume regime following the July peak and August taper. The most recent demand samples (P30-P33: 38, 45, 34, 67) average 46 units, which aligns with the baseline pre-peak levels observed in early June. On-hand inventory is currently 241 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 5.2 periods. Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, and the base stock calculation (treating \u03bc\u0302 as 46 * (1+4) = 230) would be below or near the current on-hand + pipeline inventory, the goal is to continue liquidating the surplus to minimize holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this stabilized September baseline. This will keep orders at zero while the inventory naturally draws down to a more efficient level.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. We are in a post-peak seasonal regime where demand has stabilized back to baseline levels. Recent demand (P30-P34) shows an average of approximately 41.2 units per period (38, 45, 34, 67, 22), which is consistent with the pre-July peak levels. On-hand inventory is 219 units and there are no units in transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods (L=4), the inventory position of 219 units covers approximately 5.3 periods of average demand (219 / 41.2). Since the base stock calculation for (L+1)=5 periods of demand at this mean would be roughly 206 plus safety stock, and we are currently at 219 units with no incoming orders, the OR engine will likely correctly place zero or very small orders. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this current September/October stabilized demand level. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P30-P34 is 41.2 units, mirroring the pre-peak baseline and confirming the end of the August taper.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 14, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a low-volatility baseline regime following the July peak and August taper. The most recent demand samples (P30-P35: 38, 45, 34, 67, 22, 29) average 39.2 units, which is consistent with the pre-simulation baseline. On-hand inventory is currently 190 units with zero in-transit. Given a forecasted lead time (L) of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With an average demand of ~40, the required inventory position is approximately 200 units. Since on-hand inventory (190) is very close to this requirement and there is no significant risk of stockout in the immediate future, I will maintain parameters that reflect this stabilized demand. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent October/September stability. The backend will likely trigger a small order to nudge the inventory position toward the base stock level.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a low baseline regime since late September. The most recent demand samples (P32-P36) are 34, 67, 22, 29, 30, averaging 36.4 units\u2014consistent with the pre-July baseline (~44) and significantly lower than the July peak (~154). On-hand inventory is 160 units, and there are 6 units in-transit (ordered P36). With a lead time of 4 periods, we are protected for the next 5 periods (L+1). At the current average demand of ~36.4 units per period, 160 units will last approximately 4.4 periods. This means we are reaching the point where new orders are necessary to prevent a stockout 4 periods from now. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime (approx. 40 units/period) and set L to default (4 periods). The OR backend will calculate a base stock around (1+4)*40 = 200 units. Since on-hand (160) + in-transit (6) = 166, the backend should place a small replenishment order.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 28, 2019. Demand has stabilized into an October regime, averaging 29.8 units over the last five periods (P33-P37: 67, 22, 29, 30, 34). This aligns with the pre-peak baseline and the 'carry-over insight' from Period 35. On-hand inventory is 126 units, supplemented by 30 units in-transit (ordered P36-P37). Total pipeline (156) is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate (29.8 * 5 = 149), meaning we are nearing the point where small replenishment orders are appropriate. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P29). I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-peak trend while maintaining enough variance for safety stock, as demand has been more stable since the August taper.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Historical demand has stabilized into a baseline regime following the July peak and subsequent August/September taper. The average demand from Period 30 to Period 38 is approximately 35 units per week, which aligns with initial pre-simulation and June levels. The on-hand inventory has liquidated from a peak of 425 units down to 110 units. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a stable demand around 35, the total pipeline requirement (L+1) is approximately 175 units. Currently, on-hand (110) plus in-transit (86) equals 196 units, which slightly exceeds the immediate base stock requirement. However, as the calendar moves into November, I expect a potential late-year uptick or at least stabilized demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9, from P30 onwards) to capture this post-peak baseline accurately. Lead time remains constant at 4 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P40 (2019/11/11). Historical demand analysis confirms that we have transitioned from the July high-demand peak (avg ~154) back to a stable baseline regime starting around P30. The average demand for the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39) is 31.9 units, which aligns with the pre-simulation baseline. On-hand inventory is 93 units, and there are 86 units in-transit (ordered P36-P38). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all observed arrivals. No arrivals have occurred since P29 because no orders were placed between P26 and P35 while liquidating the surplus from the summer peak. The orders placed in P36 are expected to arrive in P40 conclude (visible in P41). To maintain the current baseline, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the stabilized late-autumn demand pattern.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical demand analysis shows a stable baseline regime following the July peak and subsequent August/September taper. Between Period 30 and Period 40, the average weekly demand is approximately 31.5 units, which is notably lower than the pre-simulation baseline of ~44, suggesting a late-autumn seasonal dip. On-hand inventory is 85 units, and in-transit inventory is 80 units (from P37 and P38), totaling 165 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the current low demand trend (P38-P40 average is 15.6 units), the total inventory of 165 units is sufficient to cover approximately 5-10 weeks of demand, well exceeding the (L+1) = 5 week coverage target. Therefore, I will use a conservative recent demand window (N=10) to reflect the recent slowdown while maintaining 'default' lead time settings to avoid over-ordering during this period of inventory liquidation.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime shift: Average demand for P36-P40 has dropped further to 22.2 units, significantly lower than the P30-P35 average of 39 units, indicating a seasonal low for basic T-shirts.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The demand for the last six periods (P36-P41) has been consistently low, averaging 18.5 units, which reflects a seasonal dip for basic T-shirts as we enter winter. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 97, In-transit: 56) total 153 units, which is significantly more than the required base stock for the current demand regime (estimated at ~5 units per period * 5 periods = 25-100 units depending on safety stock). Specifically, the 56 units in transit (ordered in P38) are expected to arrive in P42. With 97 units already on hand and demand hovering below 20 units/period, there is a risk of excessive holding costs. No further ordering is required at this stage. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the contemporary low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: November/December demand regime confirmed as seasonal low: Average demand for P36-P41 is 18.5 units, down from ~40 in October. Holding costs are now a primary concern due to high residue inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). The demand analysis confirms a seasonal low for this SKU (Basic Jersey T-shirt) that began in November. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P36-P42) is 20.57 units, a significant drop from the October average of ~40. On-hand inventory is currently 132 units, which, at the recent demand rate of ~21 units/period, provides approximately 6 periods of coverage. Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, current stock plus incoming shipments (though none are currently in-transit) is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). To avoid accumulating excess inventory and incurring high holding costs in this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 7 periods (N=7). Sigma_hat is also set to the recent 7 periods to reflect the lower volatility in this stable, low-demand phase. No new ordering is expected under these parameters given the high on-hand stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. The SKU 717490015 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a seasonal low demand regime typical for late Q4. Analysis of the last 8 periods (P36-P43) shows demand has averaged 20.25 units, which is significantly lower than the P30-P35 average of 39.5. Currently, on-hand inventory is 114 units with 0 units in-transit. At the current demand rate (~20 units/period), the existing stock covers approximately 5-6 periods of demand. Given the lead time (L=4) plus review period, the total lead time coverage needed is 5 periods (L+1). 114 units is more than double the required coverage (approx 50-60 units). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current low-demand regime and maintain the default lead time (4 periods), allowing the OR backend to liquidate excess inventory without placing new orders.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019, approaching the end of the game (Period 45 of 47). Demand for this basic jersey T-shirt is in a seasonal low (averaging 15.4 units over the last five periods: P40-P44). On-hand inventory is 102 units, while the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since there are only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47) and current inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 6-7 periods of demand at the current rate (102 / 15.4 \u2248 6.6), no further orders should be placed to minimize holding costs. Setting L=4 and mu_hat to a low 'recent_N' value ensures the base stock calculation remains below the current inventory level, effectively leading the OR backend to place zero orders.

Carry-over insight: December demand confirms a deep seasonal low: average demand for P40-P44 is 15.4 units, a 60% decrease from the October average (~39 units).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 (soft jersey T-shirt) is currently in a deep seasonal low corresponding to the December holiday period. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P40-P45) is 17.7 units, and the most recent demand was 29 units. On-hand inventory is 73 units with 0 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the current average of ~18 units/period, we need approximately 90 units to cover the risk period. Our on-hand inventory of 73 is slightly below this requirement, but holding costs are high ($1.0) and equal to the profit ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio is 0.5. At this ratio, the OR backend aims for the median demand. Since 73 units already covers about 4 periods of demand at the current rate and demand is likely to remain low as we enter late December/early January for this 'Divided Basics' item, I will set parameters to maintain a lean position. I'm using a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (P40-P45). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 47 (late December). Historically, demand for this item (soft jersey T-shirt) decreased significantly in November/December to an average of ~15-20 units, but the most recent period (P46) showed a sudden spike to 40 units, possibly due to post-holiday or New Year demand. On-hand inventory is currently 33 units with 16 units in transit (ordered in P46, expected P50). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Given the profit ($1) vs. holding cost ($1) balance, the OR backend targets a 50% service level inherently, but the safety stock will protect against volatility. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (P40-P46) to capture the recent low demand while weight the recent spike (Avg ~22). Sigma_hat will be set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility seen in the last week.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in Period 46 (40 units) following a sustained low of ~15 units throughout December; potentially signals a shift in demand as the calendar year ends.
