Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows values: 54, 36, 43, 32, 55 (Mean: 44.0). Demand is relatively stable but shows some variance. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we must order immediately to cover the demand that will occur during the lead time and the first period the shipment arrives (Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Total coverage needed = (L+1) * Expected Demand. Forecasted demand is ~45 units/week. 5 periods * 45 units = 225 units. Considering the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), I will target slightly above the mean to ensure we don't stock out while waiting for the first shipment, but I won't over-order excessively. An order of 220 units covers the pipeline for approximately 5 weeks of demand.",

From historical data (Jan-Feb), demand averages ~44 units/period (54, 36, 43, 32, 55). b) Demand Regime: Period 1 demand was 41, which sits right in the historical range. No major spikes due to seasonal events are expected in mid-February for a basic tee, though spring transitions often see steady growth. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4. The order of 220 from P1 is in transit and expected to arrive in P5 (P1+4). d) Inventory: On-hand is 0. Demand for P1 was missed (sold 0). The pipeline (In-transit) is 220 units. e) Order Logic: To maintain a service level covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx 44 * 5 = 220), the current pipeline matches the target. However, since the P1 order won't arrive until P5, we will continue to stock out for P2, P3, and P4. Ordering more now won't solve the immediate stockout but would arrive in P6. I will order 50 units to start covering P6 demand, assuming 220 covers P1-P5 usage (though P1-P4 will be lost sales).",

  "rationale": "The product is a Jersey Basic T-shirt (717490015). We are currently in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). Analyzing recent demand, the SKU has entered a low-volume winter regime, with demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) averaging ~16 units/period (16, 17, 14, 12, 21). On-hand inventory is currently 103 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 6+ periods of demand at the current average rate. Given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P43) would arrive in P47, which is the final period of the game. Since the on-hand inventory (103) significantly exceeds the projected total demand for the remaining 5 periods (P43-P47), which is estimated at ~80 units (16 units/period * 5), and holding costs are $1/unit/period, any additional ordering would only increase holding costs without contributing to additional sales. No order is required.",

  "rationale": "The product is a 'Divided Basics Jersey T-shirt', which exhibits high seasonality. We are currently in December (Period 44), a low-demand period for short-sleeve basics compared to the July peak. Recent demand (Periods 38-43) has consistently averaged ~16 units/period, with the most recent observation at 18. We have 85 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (Periods 44, 45, 46, 47) and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 44) would arrive during Period 48, which is after the game concludes. Therefore, an order placed now is useless for satisfying demand. With 85 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~16-20 units per period, the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods (estimated total remaining demand = 4 * 20 = 80 units max). Ordering more would only incur additional holding costs or result in ending inventory with no reward benefit.",

  "rationale": "The product is a soft jersey basic t-shirt. Current inventory (73 units on-hand) is substantial given the established low-volume winter regime. Demand has been steadily declining: the last 7 periods (P38-P44) show demand units of 16, 17, 14, 12, 21, 18, 12, averaging approximately 16 units per period. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P45, P46, P47) and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P45) would arrive in P49, which is after the game's conclusion. Therefore, placing an order would incur procurement costs and increase ending inventory without the possibility of generating sales. The current on-hand stock of 73 is more than sufficient to cover the expected total remaining demand of ~48 units (16 units/period * 3 periods) through P47.

{
  "rationale": "The product is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt,' which is a staple item but highly seasonal (peaking in summer). We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), which is mid-winter. Historical data shows demand has significantly decelerated from the July peak of ~163 units to a winter regime of approximately 15-25 units per period. The last few periods (P41-P45) demand values were 12, 21, 18, 12, 29, yielding a 5-week average of 18.4 units. On-hand inventory is 44 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 50. Inventory of 44 covers approximately 2-2.5 periods of demand at the current rate (18.4/week). Since there is only 1 period remaining after the current decision (the game ends at the conclusion of P47), and current on-hand inventory (44) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for P46 and P47 (estimated ~20 per period), ordering more would only result in unnecessary holding costs for the final period without the possibility of arriving in time to be sold (since lead time is 4).",

This is Period 47 (December 30, 2019), which is the final week of the game. On-hand inventory is 4 units and there are 0 units in-transit. Since the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 47) would not arrive until after the game has concluded (Period 51).
