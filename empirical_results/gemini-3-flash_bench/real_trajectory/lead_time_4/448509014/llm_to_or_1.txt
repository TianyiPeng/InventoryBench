Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 448509014 (jeans). History shows demand growing from single digits in early January to 278 in the most recent week. This upward trend suggests a pre-spring ramp-up. Promised lead time is 4. I need to set parameters that cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the significant jump last week (106 to 278), the 'recent_N' method with N=3 will better capture this emerging regime than the full history mean. I will use N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the increased volume and volatility observed over the last three weeks.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a high-waisted denim trouser. We see a significant jump in demand from early January (low single/triple digits) to the most recent observation in Period 1 (demand=258) and the sample from Feb 4 (demand=278). This suggests a strong pre-spring regime shift. In Period 1, we ordered 328 units which are currently in-transit. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we expect this to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Current on-hand is 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1. To stabilize, I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this new 'high-demand' regime (~214 units/period) and recent_N=3 for volatility (sigma_hat). I'm keeping L at default (4) as we have no evidence yet of lead-time deviation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. The product is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a style of jeans. Looking at the historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4: 3, 175, 168, 106, 278) and the game history for Periods 1 and 2 (258, 315), there is a clear upward trend. The jump from ~150 to ~300 indicates a positive demand shift, likely as we move further into the spring fashion season. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with significant lost sales in P1 and P2 (573 units total). Total in-transit is 697 (328 from P1 + 369 from P2). Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the P1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at P6). Since we have no concluded arrivals yet, we cannot infer actual lead time shifts. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent high demand (278, 258, 315). For L, I will stick to default (promised 4). For sigma_hat, recent_N=3 will reflect the high volatility of the recent surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 2019 (P1); average weekly demand increased from ~150 to ~290 (+93%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is a pair of slim mom denim trousers, which typically sees stable or growing demand in early spring. Based on the historical demand samples (P-3 to P0: 3, 175, 168, 106, 278) and the completed periods (P1: 258, P2: 315, P3: 291), there is a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 1. The average demand over the last 3 periods is ~288 units, compared to the earlier average of ~150 units. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 1029 units in-transit. No orders have arrived yet, which is expected as the promised lead time is 4 periods; the order from P1 should arrive in P5 (visible in P6). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime, and stick to the default lead time as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a seasonal denim item (Divided collection). Historical demand jumped from ~150 to ~300 in Feb/March 2019. Observations for P1-P4 show demand of 258, 315, 291, and 335 (average ~300). Current on-hand is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (328 units) are expected to arrive DURING Period 5 (this period) and will be visible in the P5 conclude message. Pipeline inventory is 1365 (sum of orders P1-P4). While the carry-over insight noted a shift at P3, the data from P1-P4 is remarkably stable around the 300 mark. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current regime (avg ~300). With profit=1 and holding=1, the service level is 50%, so the OR engine will aim to keep inventory at the median. L is set to default (4) as we haven't seen the first arrival yet to confirm any drift.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is denim trousers, and we have observed a consistent demand regime since early February (P1) averaging ~306 units per week (258, 315, 291, 335, 332). The promised lead time is 4 periods, which was confirmed by the arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5 (lead_time = 4). No orders are currently overdue. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 5 demand (332) slightly exceeded the incoming Period 1 shipment (328). Total in-transit is 1171 (covering orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). For Period 6, I will use L=4 (promised). For mu_hat, I'll use the average of the last 5 demand samples (306.2) multiplied by (1+L) = 5, which equals 1531. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the volatility of the current demand regime. The high pipeline and demand require steady reordering to maintain service levels in this high-demand period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is a staple denim item (Slim Mom Denim TRS). The carry-over insight correctly identified a demand regime shift starting in Feb 2019, where average weekly demand stabilized around 290-300 units (samples: 258, 315, 291, 335, 332, 294; mean \u2248 304). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Currently, we have 75 units on hand and 1162 in-transit. The OR engine calculates base stock for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 0.50, which means the OR engine will aim for the median of the demand distribution. I will set L to 4 (promised/actual), mu_hat to cover 5 periods based on the recent regime (N=6), and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). Evaluating history, the promised lead time L=4 is consistent (orders from P1, P2, and P3 arrived exactly in P5, P6, and P7). Demand has been high, significantly exceeding our inventory in Period 7 (413 units demand vs. 407 available). The Cary-over Insight notes a shift to ~290/week, but recent samples (P4-P7) show an average of 343.5. Specifically, P7 saw a spike to 413, which might be related to early spring/April demand for denim. With 0 on-hand and 1114 in-transit, we must ensure upcoming arrivals cover the L+1 window. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this higher mean (~344), and L=4. This will target a base stock sufficient for the sustained higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased further: P4-P7 average demand is 343.5, up from the previously identified ~290 (+18%).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS'. Demand has shown a significant upward trend, specifically spiking to 521 in Period 8, confirming the upward shift noted in previous carry-over insights. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is 390, significantly higher than earlier averages. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to high demand outstripping supply. Total in-transit is 1204 units (ordered in P5, P6, P7, P8), which aligns with the pipeline required to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. I am setting L to 'calculate' to use the observed 4-period lead time. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (~390/week). sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the increased volatility (std dev) seen during this spike. This configuration helps the OR backend set a base stock high enough to service the growing demand while acknowledging the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased again: P5-P8 average demand is 390, up from the previously identified ~343 (+13%). This marks a sustained uptrend throughout Feb-April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The item is a 'Slim Mom Denim TRS' in the 'Divided' collection, which typically sees high demand in the spring. Observed lead time is stable at 4 periods (P5-P9 arrivals all confirm L=4). However, we are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have lost sales in 4 out of the last 5 periods due to stockouts. Demand shows a strong, albeit volatile, upward trend: P6: 294, P7: 413, P8: 521, and then a dip to P9: 220. The carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift, but the recent average is even higher; the mean of the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 356, but P7-P8 peaked significantly. Given the stockouts, the observed demand likely under-represents true latent demand when items were unavailable. To ensure we cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (total 5 periods of demand), I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (capturing the spring ramp-up) to calculate (1+4)*356 = 1780. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the increasing volatility seen in the last several weeks.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant peak in late March/early April (P7: 413, P8: 521) followed by a sharp drop in mid-April (P9: 220, P10: 199). This indicates that the early spring denim surge may have peaked. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 161, with a very high in-transit pipeline of 1420 units (covering orders from periods 7, 8, 9, and 10). Given that holding costs equal profit ($1.0), overstocking is as penalizing as understocking. I will use the most recent 4 periods (P7-P10) for mu_hat to account for the post-peak cooling (average ~338) and the standard deviation over the same period for sigma_hat. This approach prevents over-ordering based on the P8 outlier while respecting the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak correction: Average weekly demand dropped from 390 (P5-P8) to 338.25 (P7-P10), indicating the end of the early spring denim surge.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we have observed a significant demand drop from the spring peak (~390/week) to a much lower level. Looking at the last three periods (P9-P11), demand was 220, 199, and 176 respectively, indicating a downward trend as we move towards late spring/early summer. The average of these three periods is 198.3. This product (Slim Mom Denim) appears to have passed its peak seasonal surge observed in March and early April. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on all concluded arrivals (P1-P7 orders have arrived exactly on time). Inventory currently shows 269 units on hand and a very large pipeline (1247 units), which includes recent large orders placed during the peak. Given the current demand trajectory, the pipeline is more than sufficient. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this new lower demand regime using a window of the last 4 periods (P8-P11) which averages 279, gradually lowering the baseline to avoid excessive overstocking while acknowledging the sharp drop to ~180 in the most recent two weeks.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: Demand has dropped significantly from the spring peak (~390) to a current average of ~187 over the last 2 periods (P10-P11), suggesting a seasonal shift out of the primary denim buying window.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509014' (Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS) has clearly passed its spring peak (late March/early April) and is now in a lower demand regime. The last three periods (P10-P12) show demands of 199, 176, and 169 respectively, confirming a stabilization significantly below the previous peak of ~400-500. Currently, On-hand inventory is 526 and In-transit is 821, totaling 1347 units. Given the recent average demand (approx. 180 units/week) and the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 * 180 = 900 units. Since our pipeline (1347) already exceeds this coverage, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower demand level and prevent the OR engine from over-ordering. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4, consistent with delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level post-spring peak: P10-P12 average demand is 181.3 units, down ~53% from P8 peak.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in mid-May (P14). Historical demand shows a clear seasonal peak in late March/early April (Spring surge), followed by a significant decline. Demand for the last 4 periods (P10-P13) has been 199, 176, 169, and 111, averaging ~164 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is very high (971 units) due to the large orders placed during the peak period (P8 and P9) arriving now. With demand dropping (111 in P13), 971 units represents over 8 weeks of supply at current rates. The lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods. Given the high on-hand and in-transit (265 units from P10-P11), we are significantly overstocked relative to the current low-demand regime. Using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat correctly captures the post-peak average demand (~164) to prevent further over-ordering and allow inventory to bleed down through sales.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: P10-P13 average demand is 163.75 units, confirming a sustained downward trend from the April peak of ~400-500 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-911.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), the 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' is in a sustained post-peak cooling phase. Following the spring peak in April (where demand reached ~500), the last four periods (P11-P14) have shown a steady decline: 176, 169, 111, and 107 units. The current on-hand inventory is 1018 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate of ~100-110 units per week. The pipeline contains 111 units from Period 11 (expected to arrive in Period 15 conclusion). Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 1129, which covers roughly 10-11 weeks of the current demand regime. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs and address the clear downward seasonal shift, I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (N=4) to ensure the OR backend recognizes the drop and avoids placing new orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at lower regime: P11-P14 average demand is 140.75 units, reflecting the seasonal wind-down of the spring denim peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical data confirms that the spring demand peak for denim occurred in March and April, with weekly demand peaking over 500 units (P8). Since the peak, demand has consistently declined: P13 (111), P14 (107), and P15 (84). This confirms a seasonal exit from the high-volume spring window. We currently have an on-hand inventory of 1,045 units, which is significantly higher than the aggregate demand expected over the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5). At current demand levels (~85-100/week), we have over 10 weeks of stock. The priority is to avoid incurring excessive holding costs (equal to profit at $1/unit). I will set parameters to stop further ordering by using a recent_N (N=4) sample to capture the low-demand regime (average ~103) and keeping the lead time at default. The pipeline is clear (In-transit: 0), and the on-hand stock is more than sufficient to cover the 95th percentile of seasonal demand for the foreseeable future.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline confirmed: Average weekly demand from P12-P15 is 117.75 units, a ~65% drop from the P7-P10 average (338.25), marking the seasonal transition into early summer low-volume state for this SKU.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. Historical demand confirms a steady decline following the spring denim peak. Demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has been 169, 111, 107, 84, and 75 units, respectively. The average over the last four periods is 94.25 units. We currently have 970 units on-hand with zero units in-transit. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (q = 0.5). With 970 units on-hand, we are significantly overstocked relative to the current demand regime of ~75-100 units/week. No new orders are needed (pipeline inventory already far exceeds expected demand for the lead time + review period). I will set L to 'calculate' to continue using the confirmed 4-period lead time. Mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current low-demand summer regime, and sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the decreasing volatility. The resulting base stock will be much lower than our current on-hand inventory, correctly resulting in zero additional orders and minimizing further holding costs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509014' (Slim Mom Denim) is in a significant seasonal decline following a spring peak that peaked around Period 8 (April). Current demand has plummeted from over 400 units to just 60 units in Period 17. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 910 units, while the current demand trend (last 4 periods: 84, 75, 60, and 107 in P14) averages approximately 81.5 units per week. With zero in-transit and a massive stock surplus (910 on-hand vs. ~400 units needed for the next 5 periods), no new orders are required. The OR backend will automatically zero out orders if the base_stock calculation is lower than inventory, but I will facilitate this by utilizing 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 (capturing the current low-demand regime:Periods 14-17) and maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods. The goal is to avoid any further accumulation of holding costs while satisfying the remaining low-volume summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline continues: Average weekly demand from P14-P17 is 81.5 units, down from 117.75 in P12-P15 (-30%), confirming the SKU is in a low-volume summer trough.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained low-demand summer trough following the spring denim peak. Demand has consistently declined over the last several periods: P14 (107), P15 (84), P16 (75), P17 (60), to P18 (46). The current average demand (P16-P18) is approximately 60.3 units per week. With zero in-transit and 864 units on-hand, the current inventory level is sufficient to cover over 14 weeks of demand at the current rate (864 / ~61 = 14.1). This far exceeds the safety stock requirements for the (L+1) horizon (5 weeks). The holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0), which makes the target service level 50% (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), meaning we should strictly minimize excess stock. I will use the last 3 periods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-volume regime and prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while the current bloat is cleared.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a deep summer trough, with demand continuing to decline or remain very low (P16-P19 demand: 75, 60, 46, 55). At Period 20, we have 809 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With current weekly demand averaging ~59 units over the last 4 periods, we have over 13 weeks of inventory on-hand. Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.00), making the target service level roughly 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). To minimize further holding costs, no new orders should be placed until this inventory is significantly depleted. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the low summer demand regime and set L to default (4), which, combined with high on-hand levels, will result in the OR backend placing zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline persists: Average weekly demand from P16-P19 is 59 units, confirming the deep summer low-volume state first identified in P16-P18.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a deep summer low-demand regime, with demand consistently declining from a spring peak. The most recent 4 periods (P17-P20) show an average weekly demand of 49.75 units (60, 46, 55, 38). Current inventory on-hand is 771 units, which covers over 15 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit per unit ($1.00), excess inventory is highly penalizing. No new orders have been placed since Period 11, and no further units are in transit. The objective is to stop all ordering and deplete the massive inventory surplus. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current low-volume state, though the base stock calculation will naturally result in zero orders due to the high on-hand balance.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained low-volume summer period. Historical demand has consistently declined from a spring peak of ~400 units to a current average of approximately 60.25 units over the last four periods (P18-P21). Current on-hand inventory is 662 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next 4+1 periods (estimated at ~300 units total). The holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), which means the OR backend will favor a lower service level (q=0.5) to minimize overstocking. Since the on-hand inventory already covers more than 10 weeks of current demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the low-volume summer regime and ensure the base stock calculation remains well below current on-hand levels, naturally resulting in zero orders while managing the holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in summer trough: Period 18-21 average demand is 60.25 units, confirming a deep seasonal low for this denim SKU in July.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-332.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a seasonal recovery phase. After a sustained summer low (Period 18-21 average: ~60), demand has increased for two consecutive periods (P21: 109, P22: 165). This likely represents the 'back-to-school' or late summer transition for denim jeans. Current on-hand inventory is 497 units with no units in transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, total coverage needed is for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the most recent demand (165) as a proxy, 5 periods of demand would be ~825 units. Since on-hand (497) is significantly less than this, the OR engine needs to place an order. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this upward movement (average of 109, 165 and the previous low of 38 is ~104 per period, or 520 for mu_hat). However, a more conservative approach to stop over-ordering while demand is still fluctuating is to use the 'recent_N' method for the last 5 periods to capture the turn. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility as demand shifts from the trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: July recovery detected. Average demand increased from 60 units (P18-21) to 137 units (P21-22), indicating the start of a late-summer seasonal upturn for denim products.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant seasonal recovery in demand as we move into late July and August, likely driven by back-to-school and late-summer denim shopping. Average weekly demand has surged from ~60 units (P18-P21) to ~165 units over the last three weeks (P21: 109, P22: 165, P23: 222), with a clear accelerating trend. The current on-hand inventory is 275 units, which matches the most recent week's demand but is insufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus current period (L+1=5 periods). With no inventory currently in transit and lead times confirmed at 4 periods, a significant order is needed to prevent impending stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the steep upward momentum (average ~165), resulting in a base stock level targeting approximately 825 units (5 * 165) plus safety stock. This will trigger a replenishment order to rebuild the pipeline for the late-summer season.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand surge confirmed: Demand accelerated from 109 (P21) to 222 (P23), with a 3-week average of 165.3 units, signaling a strong seasonal recovery from the summer trough.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (slim mom denim) is experiencing a strong late-summer/pre-fall seasonal recovery. Demand increased from a summer low of ~60 (P18-P21) to 137 (P21-P22), and even with a slight dip this week to 164 from last week's 222, the 4-week average (P21-P24) is 165 units. This matches the 'Late-summer demand surge' identified in carry-over. Based on the previous spring cycle (Feb-April), where demand rose from 250 to 500, I expect this upward trend to continue as we enter the 'Back to School' and autumn shopping window. I will set mu_hat using recent_3 (periods 22-24) to capture this higher mean of ~184, which results in a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time. This will ensure we maintain availability during the seasonal uptrend while the profit/holding cost ratio (1:1) keeps us from over-ordering if the trend plateaus.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Fall seasonal recovery confirmed: Demand average for P22-P24 is 183.7 units, a 206% increase over the P18-P21 trough average (60).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the early August (Back-to-School/Fall transition) period. Demand has recovered from its summer trough (avg ~60) to a higher regime (P22-P25 average ~180). Recent demand in P24 was 164 and P25 was 170 despite stockouts, indicating a need for higher stock levels. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 498 units in-transit (orders from P24 and P25). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since we have a clear regime shift from summer lows to fall recovery, I am using recent_N=4 to capture the last month of activity (P22-P25) which reflects this upward trend without being skewed by the deep summer lows (May-June). This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the current demand of ~180 units/week over the (L+1) horizon.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak of the Back-to-School/Fall denim season (mid-August). Demand has surged from a summer low of ~60 units (P18-21) to a sustained average of 199.5 units over the last 4 periods (P23-26: 222, 164, 170, 242). I am currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) with 725 units in transit (ordered P24-26). Since promised lead time is 4 periods, I expect the order from P24 (259 units) to arrive in the next period (P28) and be visible in the P28 conclude message. To maintain the service level during this high-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand level (~200 units/week). L is kept at 'default' (4) as historical arrivals have consistently matched the promised lead time. The goal is to ensure that on-hand + pipeline inventory covers the upcoming 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained Back-to-School demand regime confirmed: P23-P26 average demand is 199.5 units, a 230% increase over the summer trough (P18-P21 average 60). Seasonality indicates high demand will likely persist through August and September.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained Back-to-School/Fall seasonal recovery. Demand has increased from a summer trough of ~60 units (P18-P21) to an average of 217.5 units over the last 4 periods (P24-P27). Specifically, the last two periods saw demand of 242 and 294, indicating a continued upward trajectory. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 988 units in-transit. The orders placed in Period 24 (259 units) and Period 25 (239 units) are expected to arrive in Period 28 and Period 29 respectively, based on the stable lead time of 4 periods. Since the current demand regime is trending upwards, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture the back-to-school surge, while maintaining the default lead-time of 4. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) during this high-demand window.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Back-to-School demand growth: P26-P27 average demand is 268 units, up 34% from the P23-P26 average of 199.5 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' is currently in a sustained 'Back-to-School' and early fall seasonal recovery. Since the summer trough (P18-P21 avg: 60), demand has significantly increased, with the most recent 4 periods (P25-P28) averaging 226.5 units. The last two periods averaged 247 units, confirming a strong upward trend. On-hand inventory is low (59), but a pipeline of 829 units is expected to arrive starting next period (orders from P25 onwards). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture this higher fall demand regime while keeping sigma_hat based on the same period to account for the increased volatility during this growth phase. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Fall demand regime confirmed: P25-P28 average demand is 226.5 units, a 277% increase over the summer trough (P18-P21 average 60). Current demand levels are plateauing near the previous spring peak (~230-250 units).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the 'Back-to-School' and Fall seasonal recovery phase. Demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to the summer trough, with the most recent 4-week average (P26-P29) at 227.75 units. Period 29 demand (175) shows a slight dip compared to the P28 peak (200) and P27 peak (294), but overall volume remains significant. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in P28 and P29. The pipeline inventory (835) combined with on-hand (123) totals 958 units, which covers approximately 4.2 weeks of demand at the current average rate (~227 units/week). To ensure adequate stock for the persistent Fall demand regime and account for the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (suggesting a 50% service level target), I will use the recent 4-period demand average (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current plateau while L remains at the default promised lead time.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained Fall/Back-to-School demand regime. Over the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 238.6 units (242, 294, 200, 175, 282). This is a significant increase from the summer trough and aligns with the 226.5 average identified in the P29 carry-over. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the three most recent arrivals (P28-P30). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this Fall plateau while ignoring the earlier low-volume summer data. On-hand is low (68), but a significant in-transit pipeline (789) exists from recent orders (P27-P30). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 weeks will allow the OR engine to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) during this seasonally high period.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Fall demand regime confirmed: Period 26-30 average demand is 238.6 units, reflecting a stabilized high-volume state after the summer trough.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical demand for this denim SKU shows a clear seasonal pattern: a spring peak (Feb-April), a deep summer trough (June), and a strong late-summer/fall recovery (Back-to-School season starting late July). We are currently in the sustained Fall demand regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 247.4 units. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the conclusion of orders from P24-P27 arriving exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is low (45), but the pipeline is healthy (849 units in-transit). Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the median of expected demand to minimize the sum of lost sales and holding costs. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the stable observed lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (P27-P31) to capture the current high-demand Fall plateau, which is significantly higher than the summer trough but seems to have stabilized compared to the rapid growth seen in August.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Fall demand plateau confirmed: Period 27-31 average demand is 247.4 units, representing the high-volume state for the September/Back-to-School season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volume Fall/Back-to-School demand regime (Sept 2019). The demand average over the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is approximately 238.4 units, consistent with the identified plateau in carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is 1088 units (orders from P29-P32), while on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and zero on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) to maintain the current stock levels and ensure the backend OR logic maintains a high enough base stock to meet the 230-250 unit weekly demand. sigma_hat will also use N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 482 units, significantly higher than the previous 5-period plateau of ~247. This spike is likely a late September/early October seasonal peak. However, looking at the spring cycle, demand peaked in Period 8 and then sharply declined. I must balance capturing this potential momentum without over-ordering as we approach October. On-hand is currently 0, with a pipeline of 947 units (expected arrivals from orders in P30, P31, P32, and P33). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent spike to 482, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to catch the upward trend while remaining cautious of the high holding cost ($1/unit) and potential post-peak drop-off seen in earlier seasons.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Fall demand surge: Demand spiked to 482 units in Period 33, significantly higher than the P27-P31 average of 247.4 (+95%), suggesting a late-cycle seasonal peak before a likely October decline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-10-07. We are entering October, which historically saw a significant demand drop in the previous seasonal cycle (April/May). Recent demand reached a late-cycle peak of 482 in Period 33, but corrected to 262 in Period 34. This matches the 'late-cycle seasonal peak' identified in Period 34's carry-over. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0) due to the Period 33 surge, but 1266 units are in-transit, including 323 units ordered in Period 31 that should arrive in Period 35. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to account for the peak and the recent correction (avg ~320), while acknowledging that October often brings lower demand for this category. L is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak correction confirmed: Demand dropped from 482 (P33) to 262 (P34), suggesting the late-cycle fall peak has passed and demand is entering an October seasonal decline phase.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU has entered an October seasonal decline phase following a late-September peak (P33). Demand has dropped significantly from 482 (P33) to 262 (P34) and then to 156 (P35). This pattern mirrors the spring behavior where demand spiked and then settled into a lower regime. The current average demand for the last two periods (P34-P35) is 209 units. However, looking at the previous year's trend/seasonal cycle for denim, we expect a further drop as temperatures cool and consumers move away from early autumn shopping toward winter gear. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture this immediate downward trend, while maintaining a default sigma_hat to account for recent high volatility (P33-P35 swing). The in-transit pipeline (1276 units) is very high, largely due to large orders placed during the P32-P34 surge (orders of 339, 104, 500 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The OR backend will likely minimize new orders this period given the large pipeline against falling demand.

Carry-over insight: Second seasonal peak post-summer trough concluded at Period 33; demand is now in a confirmed October contraction phase (average 209 units over P34-P35, down from peak of 482).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a post-peak October decline. After the late-September demand spike to 482 units in Period 33, demand has dropped to 262 (P34), 156 (P35), and 174 (P36), averaging 197 units over the last 3 periods. This aligns with the previous spring transition where demand dropped sharply after a peak. Current on-hand is 332 and in-transit is 937 (total inventory 1269), which is very high relative to the contracting demand. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining market, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (average demand ~197) to project a lower base stock. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand contraction confirmed: Average demand from P34-P36 is 197.3 units, down ~60% from the P33 spike (482 units), signaling the end of the fall/back-to-school peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-104.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late October/early November phase. Historical data shows demand has contracted significantly following the late-September peak (P33: 482 units). Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has stabilized at an average of 189.5 units (262, 156, 174, 166). This indicates a post-back-to-school plateau. On-hand inventory is 270 units, with 833 units in-transit (orders from P34 and P35 totaling 833 units are due in P38 and P39). Given the holding cost of $1.0 is equal to the profit of $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning we should aim to carry only enough inventory to meet the median demand. Current pipeline (On-hand 270 + In-transit 833 = 1103) is very high relative to the current demand regime (~190/week), covering approximately 5.8 weeks of demand. With a lead time of 4, we are already over-indexed for the next month. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current post-peak contraction regime for both mu and sigma, which will signal the OR backend to stop ordering and bleed off excess inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand analysis shows the SKU has successfully passed its Fall/Back-to-School peak (P33, 482 units) and has stabilized in a post-peak contraction phase. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 189.4 units (262, 156, 174, 166, 189), significantly down from the September high-volume state. Current on-hand inventory is 581 units with 333 units in-transit (ordered P35, expected arrival P39). This provides a total pipeline of 914 units. Given the lead time is 4 periods, total coverage needed (L+1) is 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~190 units/week, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 950 units. We are currently well-stocked. To avoid excessive holding costs during this seasonal wind-down, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the stabilized post-peak demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime stabilized: Average demand from P34-P38 is 189.4 units, confirming a consistent lower-volume state following the late-September peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. The SKU (denim trousers) is in a confirmed post-peak contraction phase following the September 'Back-to-School' surge. Average demand from P34-P39 is 178.8 units, showing a steady decline from the P33 peak of 482. Most recently, P39 demand was 126 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 788 units with 33 units in transit (due in P40), totaling 821 units available or incoming. Given the current demand level (~130-180 units/week) and a lead time of 4 periods, a base stock to cover 5 weeks of demand (L+1) would be approximately 178.8 * 5 = 894 units. Since pipeline inventory (821) is very close to this requirement and the demand trend is downward as we move into November, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P34-P39) to reflect this stabilized post-peak regime. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (6) to capture current volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand contraction confirmed: average demand from P34-P39 is 178.8 units, reflecting a lower-volume state as the fall season transitions into winter.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a late-autumn/early-winter contraction phase. In Period 40, the on-hand inventory is 669 units, which is high relative to the most recent demand levels (P34-P40 average of ~170). The current in-transit inventory is only 107 units, as the orders from P36-P38 were 0. The demand average for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 154.8 units, showing a steady decline from the September peak. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the OR backend will target. My parameters reflect the lower demand regime and the need to shed excess inventory. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend (current 5-week avg is ~155). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical conclusions.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-autumn demand contraction confirmed: Average demand for P36-P40 is 154.8 units, a 13% decrease from the P34-P39 average (178.8), reflecting the typical seasonal dip for denim trousers as winter approaches.

LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained late-autumn demand contraction. Demand in Period 41 was 82 units, continuing the downward trend from the late-summer/fall peak. As of Nov 25, we are approaching the holiday season and winter; historical patterns from earlier in the year suggest denim demand may continue to cool or stabilize at a lower baseline (similar to the summer trough) before any potential spring recovery. The average demand for the last five periods (P37-P41) is 136.4 units, but the most recent two periods (P40-P41) average 100.5 units, indicating a more aggressive decline. With on-hand inventory at 587 units and 107 units in-transit (total 694), we currently have ~6-7 weeks of coverage at recent demand levels. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the lower demand regime while weighting for the recent dip, and sigma_hat similarly to account for reduced volatility in this quieter phase. No new orders are likely given the high on-hand stock and declining demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand contraction continues through late November; 2-week average (P40-P41) is 100.5 units, down significantly from the P34-P39 average of 178.8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-9.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering December after a relative low in November (save for Period 42's spike to 289, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales). Historical demand over the last 3 periods (P40-P42) averages 163.3 units. Given the seasonality of denim, demand often stabilizes or increases slightly for the holiday season before the January clearance. Inventory is currently sufficient with 298 units on-hand and 107 in-transit (ordered P39-P40), following the logic that recent periods had high ending inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (P39-P42 = 154 units) to account for the late-November spike while acknowledging the overall downward trend from the autumn peak. Sigma_hat is calculated manually over the same period to capture the recent volatility caused by the sales event.

Carry-over insight: Late-November demand spike confirmed (P42 demand 289), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday; average demand P40-P42 is 163.3 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Period 42 showed a significant demand spike (289 units) likely tied to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (69 units). This pattern is typical of holiday sales cycles. The carry-over insights confirm a general late-autumn contraction interspersed with these event-driven peaks. On-hand inventory is 262 units, and we have 380 units in-transit (74 from P40, 306 from P43). The P40 order is expected to arrive in Period 44 (the current period) based on the stable 4-period lead time observed consistently in the history. For the OR backend, I am setting L to 'default' (4 weeks). I'm using a 'recent_N' of 5 for mu_hat to capture the post-peak late-autumn average (approx 135 units/week) while smoothing the Black Friday volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' of 8 to capture both the low-demand periods and the high-volatility spike, ensuring a safety buffer for any pre-Christmas demand fluctuations.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand is currently in a post-Black Friday seasonal lull. Historically, demand for this 'slim mom denim' SKU dropped significantly after the late November spike (P42: 289 units) to a much lower level (P43-P44 average: 77 units). This aligns with seasonal patterns where denim demand dips during the mid-winter holiday season before the spring recovery observed at the start of the year (P1-P4 demand was ~300). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P39 and P40 orders both arrived exactly in 4 periods). With 251 units on-hand and 349 units in-transit (orders from P43 and P44), and only 3 periods remaining in the game, the current pipeline is sufficient to cover the expected low demand (avg ~80 units/period) while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit). I will use a recent_N strategy for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the current lower demand regime without over-ordering for the end of the game.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand contraction: Average demand for P43-P44 is 77 units, down from the P42 peak of 289, reflecting a deep December seasonal low.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. Historical demand for this denim SKU shows a deep seasonal trough in late December/January (see Period 43-45 demand: 69, 85, 56). The recent Black Friday spike (P42: 289) has fully subsided. I expect demand to remain low for the next several weeks before the spring regime shift typically seen in February. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 195 and total in-transit at 488 (orders from P43, P44, P45), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current low-demand regime (~70 units/week). My parameters use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-volume December state, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on previous autumn peaks while maintaining a safe buffer for the eventual spring recovery.

Carry-over insight: December seasonal trough confirmed: Average demand for P43-P45 is 70 units/week, reflecting a return to low-volume state after the late-November spike.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The SKU (Denim Slim Mom Trousers) is in a deep seasonal trough following the Black Friday spike. Recent demand for Period 43-46 has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 63.25 units per week (69, 85, 56, 43). This aligns with the historical pattern observed in early 2019 where demand was also lower before the spring surge. Current on-hand inventory is 152 units, which covers approximately 2.4 weeks of current demand. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 488 units, consisting of orders from P43 (306), P44 (43), and P45 (139). The P43 order is expected to arrive during the current period (P47) as the inferred lead time from recent successful deliveries (P39, P40) remains 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and low seasonal demand, the priority is to avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs, especially since the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, requiring a balanced service level. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the current low-volume winter regime.
