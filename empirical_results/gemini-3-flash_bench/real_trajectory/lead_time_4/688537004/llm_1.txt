Historically, demand started at 0 in early January and rose to 69-88 units per week by late January/early February, coinciding with the approach of spring/vacation season. Given the date is February 11th, we are entering the pre-spring peak for swimwear. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My decision for Period 1 will arrive in Period 5 (L=4). Therefore, I must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Current on-hand is 0. Recent demand is around 88 units/week. Since the demand is trending upward but has stabilized at 88 over the last two weeks, I will estimate an average of 90 units per period for the next 5 periods. Total required pipeline = 90 units * 5 periods = 450 units. To be slightly conservative while establishing a safety buffer for a seasonal item, I will order 450 units.",

Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 43 units per week over the last 10 periods (P34-P43: 71, 40, 34, 21, 35, 35, 48, 25, 75, 37). There are only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47). With 778 units currently on-hand and an average weekly demand of ~43, we have roughly 18 weeks of supply. Given the game ends in Period 47, we have a massive surplus. No further orders are required, as on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to meet the remaining demand while minimizing further holding costs.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a swimwear item (bikini bottoms), which is highly seasonal. We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December), and the game ends at Period 47. Historical data shows that demand is currently in a 'terminal' low regime, averaging approximately 30-40 units per week during the late autumn and winter months (recent periods: 35, 37, 75, 25, 48, 35, 35, 21). On-hand inventory is 743 units with zero units in transit. Given that there are only 3 periods remaining (45, 46, and 47) and the delivery lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive after the game has concluded (Period 49). Furthermore, our current stock of 743 units is significantly more than enough to cover the expected demand of ~120-150 units for the remaining duration. Ordering more would only increase holding costs without any potential for additional sales or profit.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a swimwear item (bikini bottoms), which is highly seasonal. We are currently in late December (Period 46). Historical data from earlier in the year shows that demand for this item starts very low (approx. 70-90 units/week in Jan/Feb) before rising significantly in March and peaking in June/July (max 799). Current demand in Nov/Dec has been hovering between 25-75 units, with the most recent Period 45 demand at 32 units. On-hand inventory is 711 units, which is significantly higher than the current demand rate and sufficient to cover the expected winter baseline and the initial spring ramp-up. Given a holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $1.0, there is high pressure to minimize excess stock. No further orders are needed until inventory levels significantly decrease or the upcoming spring season demand exceeds the current buffer.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a swimwear bottom (688537004), currently in a low-demand terminal regime as of late December (Period 46 concluding, Period 47 beginning). Demand has consistently trended downward since the peak in June/July (Period 20: 799 units) and has averaged approximately 35 units per week over the last 10 periods (P37-P46). With an on-hand inventory of 696 units and zero in-transit, the current stock covers nearly 20 weeks of demand at the present rate. Given that the next seasonal upswing for swimwear typically doesn't begin until February/March (Q1) and the holding cost is $1.0 per unit/period (balanced with $1.0 profit), maintaining excessive inventory is costly. New ordering is not required as the current pipeline and on-hand stock are more than sufficient to cover the established demand regime for the next several months.",
