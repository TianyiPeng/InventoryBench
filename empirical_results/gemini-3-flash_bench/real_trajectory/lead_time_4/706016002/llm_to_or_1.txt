Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 706016002 is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple fast-fashion item. Historical demand (5 samples) shows mean=526.6, std=78.8. The most recent demand (2019-02-04) was 649, suggesting a potential upward trend or seasonality as we move toward spring. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no inventory (On-hand: 0, In-transit: 0) and zero lead-time history yet, I will use the 'default' lead time method and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the recent higher demand (N=5). As this is the first period, the goal is to initiate the pipeline to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand immediately.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim (High-waisted jeans). Analysis of historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 11) shows: 557, 438, 489, 500, 649, and 544. The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 529.5 units. The demand appears relatively stable with a slight upward trend in early February before settling. Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. In Period 1, 659 units were ordered and are currently in-transit; however, on-hand inventory started at 0, resulting in 544 lost sales in Period 1. Since L=4, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 start observation. To ensure future demand is met while account for the 1-period observation lag and the L=4 lead time, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use the mean of the available 6 samples to forecast demand and standard deviation for safety stock. Method 'recent_N' with N=6 captures the entirety of our known history for this SKU.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a core high-waisted denim item. Previous samples (Jan-Feb) show demand between 438-649. Periods 1 and 2 had demands of 544 and 545, consistent with the historical mean of ~523. Inventory is currently 0 because arrivals have not yet started (promised lead time L=4). Orders from P1 (659 units) and P2 (649 units) are in-transit. Since no arrivals have occurred, literal lead time cannot be inferred yet; however, we stay with the promised lead time L=4. Demand appears stable. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (uniting the 5 historical points and the 2 observed game periods) to capture the current stable regime.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is a staple item. Initial stock started at 0, and because the promised lead time is 4 periods, no shipments have arrived yet (first arrival expected Period 5). Consequently, no sales have been made, and backlogs are accumulating. Historical demand samples (last 5) average ~526, and actual demand during the first three periods (544, 545, 451) average ~513. There is no evidence of a regime shift or lead-time deviation yet, as the first order from Period 1 is not due until next period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (5 historical samples + 3 game samples) to stabilize the forecast around the observed mean of roughly 520 units per week. With L=4, the base stock will target (1+4)=5 periods of demand. Sigma will be calculated from the same sample window to capture current volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS, a staple 'Divided Collection' item. Historical demand (pre-game + Periods 1-4) shows a mean of approximately 521 units per week (Samples: 557, 438, 489, 500, 649, 544, 545, 451, 435). Demand appears relatively stable without a strong seasonal trend evident in early March for this category. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 2582 units. Since no orders have concluded yet, we cannot infer a deviation from the promised lead time. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to allow the backend to use all realized data once it arrives, and 'recent_N' with N=9 (all available samples) for demand and volatility to capture the full recent distribution.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first order (Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand history (including pre-game and observed periods) shows samples: 557, 438, 489, 500, 649 (pre-game) and 544, 545, 451, 435, 464 (game history). The mean across these 10 samples is roughly 507.2. There is no strong evidence of a regime shift yet; demand remains relatively stable. On-hand is 195, and in-transit is 2157 (representing orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Total pipeline inventory is 2352. Using L=4, the base stock should cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 507.2 = 2536. Since current pipeline is 2352, the system should order approximately 184 more units. I will use 'default' for L to stick to the confirmed lead time and 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full stable history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1 order arrived in P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), we are managing a denim product ('Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS'). The carry-over insight and arrival history (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6) confirm the actual lead time L = 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand for this SKU shows stability: the five pre-game samples averaged ~526, and the first six periods of play have averaged ~483. Recent demand (last 4 periods) is very consistent around 450-460 units. Pipeline inventory is currently 1940 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6), with arrival of the P3 order (641 units) expected during this period (visible next period). Total inventory position (on-hand 383 + in-transit 1940 = 2323) is robust against a (1+L) = 5-period demand window (~2250-2500 units). I will use the recent 6 samples (live play data) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they reflect the current in-game demand regime better than the older pre-game samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS. Observed demand over the last 7 periods has been relatively stable, ranging from 435 to 545, with a mean of 491.7. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, and 7 conclusions). Current on-hand is 482, and in-transit is 1571. The 1571 in-transit includes orders from P4 (633), P5 (234), P6 (432), and P7 (272). The P4 order is expected to arrive during Period 8 (visible at the start of P9). With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level q is 0.95. I will continue using the promised lead time of 4. For demand (mu_hat), recent data suggests stability, so I'll use recent_N with N=7 to capture the full game history mean (~492). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=7 to reflect the observed volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019/4/08). Analyzing the demand history, we observe a significant spike in Period 8 (795 units) compared to the prior 7 periods (avg ~496). This aligns with early April seasonality for fashion items. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P1-P4). Total demand samples (including pre-game) show a mean of 537. To account for the recent demand surge while acknowledging earlier lower volumes, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (mu_hat) with N=4 to capture the upward trajectory of late March/early April. I will keep Lead Time (L) at the promised default of 4 as it matches observations. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=4 to better reflect the increased volatility seen in the recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 8: demand increased from an average of ~500 to 795 (+59%), likely due to early April seasonal trends for denim.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Periods 5-9). A significant demand regime shift was noted starting Period 8, where demand jumped to 795 before settling back to 538 in Period 9. The average demand for the first 7 periods was approx 497, while the average for the most recent 2 periods is 666 (+34%). With on-hand inventory nearly depleted (16 units) and pipeline inventory (2103 units) covering orders from Periods 6-9, we need to maintain a higher base stock to cover the (L+1)=5 period lead time. Since demand for skinny denim often spikes in early spring but can be volatile, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand to capture the new, higher regime while balancing the dip observed last period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019-04-22). The product is a SKU of High-Waisted Skinny Denim. Historical demand showed a significant spike in Period 8 (795 units) but has since cooled down in Periods 9 and 10 (mean of last two periods is ~481). The carry-over insight from Period 9 noted a 59% increase, but the actual demand for the last two periods suggests that spike may have been a temporary seasonal burst rather than a sustained regime shift. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (23), and while in-transit (2539) covers the pipeline, the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent cooling of demand while still weighting the spike slightly, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen during that April period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019/4/29). Recent history shows a stockout in Period 11 (demand 385, sold 295, ending on-hand 0). Although Period 8 showed a spike to 795, the subsequent periods (P9: 538, P10: 425, P11: 385) suggest that the demand surge was temporary or seasonal. The mean of the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 535.75, which is closer to the long-term average than the P8 peak. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, and P11 conclusions). There are 3165 units in transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11), which significantly exceeds current on-hand inventory. Given the stockout and the lead time of 4, the target inventory must cover 5 periods (L+1). I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the recent mean demand of ~536 while accounting for the high volatility seen in P8. This ensures we order enough to recover from the stockout without overcompensating for the single P8 outlier.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/5/6 (Period 13). We are managing Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS. Reviewing the history: Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P8 order arrived P12). Regarding demand, my Period 9 insight noted a spike in early April (P8-P10, mean ~586); however, the last two periods (P11-P12) show mean demand dropped to 369. This suggests the spring peak has subsided as we move into May. On-hand inventory is 221. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is significant at 2784 units. Specifically, orders from P9 (825), P10 (868), P11 (898), and P12 (193) are in transit. The arrival for P13 will be the 825 units from P9. Given the recent drop in demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the slow-down while maintaining safety for potential volatility. I'll use recent_N for sigma to account for the recent variance between the peak and the subsequent drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: After an early April peak (avg ~586), demand has cooled significantly in late April/early May to ~369 (-37%).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Demand for this denim SKU has entered a lower regime. After an early April peak (avg ~586), demand in the last three periods (P11-P13) has averaged 339 units (385, 353, 280), confirming the cool-down noted in the Period 13 carry-over insight. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 766, with a large pipeline of 2111 units (orders from P10, P11, P12, and P13). For P14, I will use recent trends to set parameters: mu_hat will be based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current lower demand level (~339/week). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. This approach prevents over-ordering as the season trends downward into mid-May.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), the SKU '706016002' (skinny denim) is entering a lower demand regime following an April peak. Recent demand (Periods 11-14) has averaged 351.75 units, significantly down from the early April surge. The carry-over insights confirm this cooling trend. On-hand inventory is currently high (1245 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the April peak (e.g., 868 units arriving in Period 14). With 1243 units currently in-transit (898 ordered in P11, 193 in P12, 152 in P13) and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the pipeline is more than sufficient. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The OR backend will likely order zero or very few units because the on-hand + in-transit inventory far exceeds the calculated base stock for the current demand level.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/05/27), we are in a late-spring/early-summer demand phase for the superstretch denim trousers. Historical data and recent trends show demand stabilizing after the early April peak. The last three periods (P13-P15) show demand of 280, 389, and 471 respectively, netting an average of ~380 units per week. This aligns with the 'cooled' regime noted in Period 13 carry-over insights. Currently, the inventory position is very high: on-hand inventory is 1,672 units with 345 units in-transit (reaching P16 arrival and P17 arrival). This total inventory of ~2,017 units vastly exceeds the required base stock for a lead time of 4 periods (~1,900 units at 380 demand/week). Therefore, the system correctly ordered 0 units in the last two periods. My parameters aim to stabilize this by using a recent_N (N=5) window to capture the post-peak demand mean of ~375. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to allow the high on-hand inventory to drawdown while maintaining a service level that avoids stockouts should demand fluctuate slightly upwards.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the SKU 706016002 (skinny denim) is entering the summer season. Historical data shows demand has stabilized recently after the early April peak and late April cooling. Over the last 4 periods (P13-P16), demand has averaged 406.5 units (280, 389, 471, 486), showing a steady recovery back toward the 400-500 range. Lead time is consistently 4 periods per arrival history. Current on-hand inventory is high (1379 units), with 267 units still in-transit (P13 and P16 orders). The inventory position (1646) is high relative to the recent demand average, so the OR backend will likely mitigate further ordering to avoid excess holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the stabilization after the April volatility, and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the current variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized in May/early June around an average of ~400 units following April's volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has stabilized following the volatility observed in April. Over the last four periods (P14-P17), demand values were 389, 471, 486, and 429, averaging 443.75 units. This represents a consistent regime after the May cooldown. The lead time remains steady at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrival events. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (1102 units) due to large orders placed during the April peak arriving now. With an in-transit pipeline of 635 units (ordered P14-P17) and an expected weekly demand of ~444 units, the total inventory position covers approximately 4 periods of demand. To maintain the service level while reflecting recent stability, I will use recent_N (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time (4 periods).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim has stabilized in early summer following the April volatility. The most recent five periods (P14-P18) show a mean demand of 438.2 units (389, 471, 486, 429, 416) with a standard deviation of 40.5. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Although Period 18 reported 0 arrivals, this is consistent with the order of 0 placed in Period 14 (P14+4=P18). Pipeline inventory currently includes orders from P16 (115), P17 (520), and P18 (516). Total on-hand (686) plus in-transit (1151) equals 1837 units, which covers over 4 periods of present demand. Given the high service level requirement (profit $19 vs holding cost $1), I am using the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain the current stable performance without over-ordering due to previous April spikes.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (2019/6/24), we are in a stable demand regime for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim'. Over the last 4 concluded periods (P16-P19), demand has averaged 428 units (486, 429, 416, 381), confirming the stabilize-around-400 insight from Period 17. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time is 4. Analysis of history confirms this: orders from P1-P13 all arrived with exactly a 4-period lead time. However, Period 18 and Period 19 conclude messages showed 0 arrivals. This is expected behavior for a lead time of 4: the order from P14 (ordered 0) was due in P18, and the order from P15 (ordered 0) was due in P19. The next arrival should be the 115 units from P16 arriving in P20, and the 520 units from P17 arriving in P21. Current on-hand is 305 and in-transit is 1652. Total pipeline is 1957. Since demand is stable, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current mean (~428) and volatility. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level consistent with a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 21 (July 1st). Demand has stabilized in June at an average of approximately 375 units (Periods 17-20: 429, 416, 381, 274). On-hand inventory is low (146), but pipeline inventory is very high (1881), containing orders from P17 (520), P18 (516), P19 (501), and P20 (344). There were no orders in P14 and P15, which explains the zero arrivals in P18 and P19. The P16 order (115) arrived in P20, confirming the 4-period lead time remains consistent. Since the current demand regime has been stable for 4 periods and the product is a standard 'Divided Collection' denim SKU, I will use a recent_N window of 4 to capture the current stabilization. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the high pipeline while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the lead time PLUS the review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/08. Demand for the skinny denim product has stabilized in June and early July, averaging approximately 342 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 17-21). This is a slight decrease from the previously observed May average of ~400, but represents a consistent summer baseline. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 17 order in Period 21. Currently, there is an inventory gap: on-hand inventory is 334 units, while Period 18 and Period 19 orders (totaling 1017 units) are overdue or delayed (as they would have arrived in P22 and P23 under normal drift, but were '0' in the conclude messages for P18 and P19). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1468 units confirms these orders are still active. To manage this period, I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable summer trend (avg ~342), and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) remains at the promised/observed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in early July (Periods 17-21) at an average of ~342 units/week, down ~15% from the May average of ~400.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the SKU '706016002' (High-waisted skinny denim) is in a stable summer demand phase. Demand has settled significantly from the early April peak. Analysis of the most recent regime (Periods 17-22) shows a stable average demand of ~360 units per week (429, 416, 381, 274, 332, 329). I am selecting N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this July stability while discarding the higher May volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrivals of orders from Periods 16, 17, and 18 precisely 4 periods later. On-hand inventory (521) plus Pipeline (1217) totals 1738 units. With a 4-period lead time, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My parameters target a base stock sufficient to cover this window (~1800 units total), ensuring high service levels for this profitable item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1) while the system caps orders to prevent overstocking as we move deeper into summer.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016002' (denim trousers) is currently experiencing stable demand in July 2019. Observations from Periods 20-23 show demand values of 274, 332, 329, and 323, averaging 314.5 units per period. This confirms the carry-over insight from Period 22 regarding a stable regime (~342 units in early July), with a slight further easing. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the recent arrival of the Period 19 order in Period 23. Given the current on-hand inventory (699) and the pipeline inventory (997), the total cover is 1696. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current rate of 314 units/week, 5 periods of demand is approximately 1570 units. Since 1696 > 1570, the OR engine's capped policy will likely result in a small or zero order to manage holding costs while maintaining a high service level. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this stabilized summer demand floor for both mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized further in late July (Periods 20-23) at an average of ~315 units/week, suggesting a consistent mid-summer trough before potential back-to-school shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2517.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand has consistently declined throughout July, with the most recent observation (178 units) being the lowest in many periods. The current on-hand inventory (865) and in-transit units (736) are significantly higher than the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Specifically, at the current average demand of ~300 units, the system already has enough stock to cover roughly 5 weeks. Given the high holding cost relative to the risk of stockout (q = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this downward summer trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough confirmed in late July: Period 24 demand (178) dropped ~45% compared to the July 1-21 average (~325), marking a significant seasonal low.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 26 (August 5). Historically, demand for this skinny denim SKU hit a trough in late July (Periods 24-25), with demand averaging 207 units. However, looking at the wider summer window (Periods 20-25), the average is approximately 280 units. In early August, we anticipate the start of the 'Back-to-School' transition, where clothing demand typically rebounds from summer lows. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on historical arrivals. Current inventory position is strong: On-hand (736) + In-transit (705) = 1,441 units. This covers roughly 5 weeks of demand at the recent average of 280, or ~4.5 weeks if demand scales back up toward the 320-350 range. To account for the expected seasonal uptick from the July trough while remaining cautious about excess holding costs, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat (N=6), which covers the full summer stabilization and the most recent dip. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the higher volatility seen during these recent transitions.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand has consistently stayed in a summer trough since Period 24, with latest demands being 178, 236, and 260. The mean of the last 3 periods is ~225. We are entering mid-to-late August, which typically sees the start of 'Back to School' transitions for denim products (Jade HW Skinny Denim). While the most recent performance is low, I anticipate a modest uptick toward the late May/early June levels (~400) or at least the early July levels (~342) in the coming weeks. However, starting on-hand (741) and in-transit (621) are quite high relative to the current trough demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the summer low period) to set a baseline, and use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough confirmed throughout late July and early August (Periods 24-26) with an average of ~225 units, significantly below the early summer average of ~340.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has shown a recovery in Period 27 (415 units) from the late July/early August trough (average ~225). This aligns with the expected start of the 'Back-to-School' season in mid-to-late August, where demand for staple denim typically increases. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this upward shift while tempering it with the preceding low weeks to avoid over-ordering before the trend is fully established. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (Periods 24-27 all confirmed 4-period lead times). On-hand inventory (607) and In-transit (591) are healthy, covering approximately 3 weeks of the current demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery detected in Period 27 (415 units), signaling the end of the mid-summer trough and likely start of Back-to-School seasonal demand for denim.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/26. We are observing the start of the 'Back-to-School' season for denim. Period 27 showed a sharp increase to 415 units, and Period 28 remained elevated at 348 units (average of 381.5 over the last two weeks), compared to the late-July/early-August trough average of ~225. This confirms the demand recovery identified in the carry-over insights. Total pipeline + on-hand is 1289 units (342 + 947). With a 4-period lead time, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this recovery phase. Using the recent average of ~382 and projecting a slight seasonal increase as we enter September, I estimate weekly demand at 400. Thus, mu_hat = (1+4) * 400 = 2000. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (approx sqrt(5)*110) to account for the increased volatility seen during transition periods. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School recovery sustained: Periods 27-28 average demand is 382 units, up ~70% from the previous 3-week trough (~225).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, which is the peak of the Back-to-School (BTS) shopping season for denim (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS). We have observed a demand recovery over the last three periods (P27-P29) with an average of approximately 355 units, compared to the late-summer trough of ~225 units. While Period 29 (302) was lower than Period 27 (415), the overall trend is upward. We are currently in a transition phase into early autumn. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. Inventory is currently low (116 on hand), but there is a large pipeline (1455 units) due to arrive. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current BTS demand level, and set sigma_hat using the same period to account for the recent volatility in the recovery phase. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the 'Back-to-School' (BTS) demand recovery phase for skinny denim. Period 30 saw a significant demand of 526 units, causing a stockout as only 297 units were on-hand. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P27-P30) is approximately 398 units, confirming a sustained recovery from the summer trough (~225 units). The date (2019/09/09) aligns with peak BTS activity. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P26 arrival in P30). With 0 on-hand and 1687 in-transit, we must set parameters that allow the system to maintain a base stock covering lead time plus review (L+1 = 5 periods). I am choosing recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current BTS demand level (~400/week) while ignoring the previous low-demand trough. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent increase in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak confirmed: Period 30 demand reached 526; 4-week average (P27-P30) is ~398, a ~75% increase over the summer trough.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016002 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a 'Back-to-School' demand peak in mid-September. Recent demand (P30-P31) has spiked to 526 and 540 units, significantly higher than July/August levels, leading to stockouts with 0 units on-hand. The current in-transit pipeline (1994 units) includes large orders from P28 (439), P29 (584), P30 (413), and P31 (558). We expect the P28 order (439 units) to arrive during P32 (observed in P33). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To manage the current peak and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the lumpy arrivals, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 5-period average (approx 426 units/week) to capture the surge from August into September. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on the last 5 periods to reflect the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak sustained into mid-September: Period 30-31 demand averaged 533 units, representing a 34% increase over the late August average (~398).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016002 is currently experiencing a Back-to-School demand peak in mid-September. Recent demand samples show a high regime: P30 (526), P31 (540), and P32 (451), averaging 505.7 units. This is a significant increase from the August average of ~380. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with stockouts occurring in the last three periods (P30-P32), indicating that actual demand is exceeding available supply despite arrivals. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 2081 units (orders from P29, P30, P31, P32). Since the demand has shifted to a higher level, I am using recent_N=3 to capture the mid-September peak for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock level that accounts for the current 500+ unit weekly demand and the 4-period lead time (covering 5 periods of demand), ensuring the OR engine orders enough to clear the stockout and maintain high service levels during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak sustained in mid-September: Periods 30-32 average demand is 506 units/week, maintaining the ~75% increase over the summer trough.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016002 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a strong Back-to-School/Autumn demand surge. Period 33 observed a significant demand spike to 781 units, up from the previous three-week average of ~506 (+54%). My previous forecast was too conservative, leading to a stockout (on-hand is 0) despite the arrival of 584 units. Given this sharp upward trend as we move into late September/October, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 3250. This is calculated as (L+1) * 650, where 650 is a forward-looking average demand estimate that accounts for the recent 781 peak but regresses slightly toward the new high mean. I am using recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture the heightened volatility of this surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent concluded shipments (P26-P29).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 33: Weekly demand jumped to 781 units, representing a ~54% increase over the mid-September average (~506), confirming a vigorous Autumn peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 35 (2019/10/07). Demand has been volatile but high, representative of an Autumn peak for denim. The demand in Period 33 was 781, followed by 472 in Period 34. The average demand across these last two periods (P33-34) is 626.5. This follows a high mid-September average (~506). Given the inventory stockouts in Periods 30 through 34, we are under-forecasting the current regime's intensity and failing to manage the lead-time pipeline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand is 0 and we are consistently selling out, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5: Periods 30-34) to capture the higher mean (~554) which includes the recent spike, providing a more aggressive base stock to mitigate lost sales during this Autumn peak. The sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen in the 781 and 472 demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand average for P30-P34 is ~554 units, a 10% increase over the mid-September peak (~506) and frequent stockouts occurring.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand Autumn period for skinny denim (Mid-October). Period 35 demand (349) was lower than the previous week's spike (472), but stockouts in Periods 30-34 indicate that 'actual demand' likely exceeded 'sold' units. The carry-over insights confirm an Autumn peak with a Recent_N (P30-P34) average of ~554 units. With on-hand inventory at 209 and a high in-transit pipeline (2699), we must maintain high base stock settings to ensure service levels during this seasonal window. I will use N=6 for mu_hat (P30-P35) to capture the full Autumn peak regime including the most recent data point, which averages approximately 520 units per week. This prevents over-reacting to the single lower demand point in Period 35 while acknowledging the earlier stockout-driven demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5765.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows an Autumn peak with a sharp spike in Period 33 (781 units) followed by a cooling trend in October (Periods 34-36 averaging ~382 units). Based on calendar knowledge, late October/early November demand for denim typically maintains a steady baseline before potential holiday spikes, though the immediate trend is a deceleration from the September peak. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P33-P36) to capture this most recent volatility and stabilization, which averages ~482 units per week. This accounts for both the peak and the subsequent cooling. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 410 and a large pipeline of 2397 units (much of which was ordered during the peak stockout phase), there is a risk of over-inventory if demand continues to drop. However, the OR backend's cap mechanism will help prevent excessive ordering. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the most current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling in October: After the September Autumn peak (Period 33 demand 781), demand has stabilized in Periods 34-36 at an average of ~382 units per week, reflecting a ~50% reduction from the peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 28, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant cooling trend in October following an Autumn peak in September. Demand over the last four concluded periods (P34-P37) has averaged approximately 371 units (472, 349, 325, 341), which is a ~50% drop from the September 23rd high of 781 and consistent with the cooling trend noted in Carry-Over Insights. I am setting L to 'calculate' as the lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture this lower late-October stabilization and avoid over-ordering based on the previous peak. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N with N=4 to reflect the current reduced volatility in this stabilized regime. Pipeline inventory is currently high (2185), likely due to aggressive orders placed during the September peak, so base stock parameters will naturally temper new ordering to manage holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed in mid-to-late October (Periods 34-37) at an average of ~371 units per week, representing a sustained ~50% reduction from the September Autumn peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for Skinny Denim has stabilized after the September peak (Period 33). In the four periods since that peak (P34-P37), demand has averaged 371 units per week (472, 349, 325, 304), showing a consistent downward trend. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 to capture this stabilized demand level of ~371 units/week. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 1236 and 1299 units in-transit (orders from P35, P36, P37), the pipeline is currently very full (~2535 units) relative to the current demand rate (~371 * 5 = 1855 requirement). This high inventory position will likely result in the OR backend placing a zero or minimal order to allow the pipeline to clear, which is appropriate given the current holding costs and cooling demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3202.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40 (2019/11/11), the inventory position is heavily elevated. On-hand inventory is 1,681 units with an additional 597 units in-transit (expected in P40 and P41). Recent demand has shown a clear downward trend following the September peak; demand in Periods 34-39 averaged approximately 341 units, with the most recent Period 39 recording only 257 units. This cooling aligns with the post-Autumn/pre-Holiday transition for denim. With a current inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) of 2,278 units, and an expected weekly demand of ~340, we have over 6 weeks of stock. To minimize holding costs and prevent further overstocking, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) of the cooling regime (P34-P39) to reflect the contemporary lower demand levels. The OR backend will likely order 0 units given that current pipeline inventory far exceeds the target base stock for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in late October/early November: Periods 34-39 average demand is ~341 units per week, compared to the September Autumn peak of ~554 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a lower late-Autumn regime after the October cooling. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged approximately 337 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high (1597 units) due to deliveries from the late-September peak orders arriving while demand was declining. With a lead time of 4, the target base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) at a mean of ~337 would be around 1685 units. Including the 373 units in-transit (from the P37 order), total pipeline inventory is 1970 units, which is already above the required level. Consequently, the OR backend logic will likely result in a zero order for this period. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current stabilized demand regime and calculate for L as lead times remain stable at 4 periods.

Currently, on-hand inventory is high (1694 units) and there are no units in-transit according to the current status, as the orders from P38-P41 were zero. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a stable demand around 300, the inventory position (1694) is more than sufficient to cover the next 5+ periods (L+1 demand ~ 1500 units). I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent stabilized demand level (\u03bc \u2248 302) and volatility. This will result in a zero order which is appropriate given the current overstock situation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in November: Periods 36-41 average demand is ~302 units per week, reflecting a post-autumn peak cooling.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked to 1,366 units, which is a massive increase (over 4.5x) compared to the November average of ~302. This is consistent with Black Friday/Cyber Monday shopping week in early December. The current on-hand inventory has dropped to 328 units, and there are 0 units in-transit (all orders from the low-demand November period have arrived or were zeroed out). Given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in 4 weeks (late December/early January), which typically sees a post-holiday demand drop. However, the immediate priority is to avoid stockouts if this high demand persists into the early December holiday shopping season. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the recent spike while also considering the preceding stabilization, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the significantly increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand spike detected in late November (Period 42: 1366 units), confirmed as Black Friday seasonal peak for denim products.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9). Period 42 (Nov 25) experienced a massive Black Friday spike of 1366 units, which was correctly identified. Period 43 demand returned to a baseline of 306 units. Looking at the calendar, we are now in the pre-Christmas/Holiday shopping season. Historically, denim often sees a secondary peak in December before a January lull. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (22 units) after the Black Friday surge, but a large order of 1118 units was placed last period (P43). Given the lead time of 4, this order will not arrive until Period 47. We must ensure we have enough inventory to cover the remaining periods of the game (ending at Period 47). I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the post-autumn baseline while accounting for the recent high-volatility spike, and stay with 'calculate' for lead time as it has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday peak confirmed in Period 42 (1366 units), followed by a return to baseline (~300 units) in early December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the product is out of stock (On-hand: 0) following the Black Friday peak (1366 units) and subsequent baseline demand (~300-350 units). We are currently in mid-December (2019/12/16), approaching the end of the year. There are 2416 units in-transit, which represents the large orders placed in Period 43 (1118 units) and Period 44 (1298 units). However, due to the 4-period lead time, these units will not arrive until Period 47 and Period 48 respectively. We are staring at a stockout gap for the next 2-3 periods. Since 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)', and pipeline_inventory (2416) is already very high relative to expected demand (approx 300-350 units/week), any standard mu_hat/sigma_hat calculation will result in an order of 0 units for this period. Even using 'recent_N' with N=1 on the Black Friday spike would likely not overcome the pipeline inventory offset. Therefore, I will use default or recently stabilized parameters to maintain the logic, acknowledging that no new order will be triggered until the pipeline is cleared or demand forecasts shift drastically.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), following the Black Friday spike and subsequent stockout. On-hand inventory is 0. However, the pipeline is extremely full (3716 units) due to large orders placed in Periods 43 (1118), 44 (1298), and 45 (1300). Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, these orders are expected to arrive in Periods 47, 48, and 49 respectively. The immediate concern is the arrival from Period 43 (1118 units) arriving next period. Demand has returned to a stable baseline of ~300 units following the Black Friday peak (P43: 306, P44: 351, P45: 265). With 3716 units in transit and demand at ~300, we are significantly over-indexed for the post-holiday period. I will use a conservative demand forecast (recent_N=3) to reflect the post-peak baseline and set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent. The OR backend will likely order 0 or very little given the massive pipeline relative to current demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are in the final period (Period 47). Looking at the inventory state, we have 0 on-hand units and 3716 units in-transit. These in-transit units are from orders placed in Period 43 (1118 units), Period 44 (1298 units), and Period 45 (1300 units). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the Period 43 order should arrive during Period 47 (visible in the next conclude message), which would have been useful if there were more periods. However, since this is the final period, the main goal is to reflect the current normalized demand. After the Black Friday spike (Period 42: 1366 units), demand has returned to its typical baseline. For the last four concluded periods (P43-P46), demand has been 306, 351, 265, and 231, averaging approximately 288 units per week. I will set mu_hat to reflect this stabilized baseline using recent_N (N=4) to ensure the backend captures the post-holiday cooling. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the lowered volatility after the peak. Lead time remains 'default' at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Periods 43-46 demand averaged ~288 units, confirming a return to baseline after the late November peak.
