Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11), which is the start of the week including Valentine's Day (Feb 14). The product is 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' lingerie, a category highly sensitive to Valentine's Day demand. Historical data shows a clear upward trend leading into this week: demand rose from ~12 units at the start of January to 82 units on Jan 28 and 59 units on Feb 4. Given the seasonal peak, I'll use a recent window (N=3) to capture this higher demand regime for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since there is no history of arrivals yet, I'll use the 'default' method for L. The OR backend will compute the base stock using a target service level of 0.5 (as Profit=1 and Holding=1, q=1/(1+1)=0.5), which effectively targets the median demand to minimize total costs in a high-holding-cost environment.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the product (Liza Push Melbourne 2pk) and the demand history, there is a clear upward trend. Demand samples: 12, 11, 48, 82, 59 (last five samples before P1) and then 67 in P1. Current on-hand is 0, with a pipeline of 92 (ordered in P1). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we don't expect the P1 order to arrive until P5. In the meantime, we have high demand (avg of last 3 periods \u2248 69) and 0 stock, leading to lost sales. While the OR backend calculates a target base stock to cover L+1 periods, I need to account for the recent demand regime. The demand shifted from low double digits (12, 11) to a higher level (48, 82, 59, 67) starting late January. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime (avg \u2248 64). For L, I use default (4) as we have no 'conclude' messages to suggest a shift yet. The OR backend will use these to aim for a base stock around (1+4)*64 = 320 units, helping to catch up once shipments arrive.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history shows a significant jump starting in late January (from ~12 to ~48-82 units), likely a seasonal Valentine's Day peak given the product is 'Push-up bras'. Post-Valentine's (Feb 4th to Feb 18th), demand has stabilized between 59-71 units. Inventory is currently critical: we have 0 on-hand and 180 in-transit. Based on the rules, the orders placed in P1 (92 units) and P2 (88 units) are still in transit. With a promised lead time of 4, the P1 order is expected to arrive at the start of Period 5 (concluded in P5 message, visible P6). Since demand has settled into a new regime compared to the early January baseline, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the current mean (~71 units per week). This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the higher sustained demand while considering the 180 units already in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected from late Jan: average weekly demand increased from ~12 to ~65-70 units sustained over the last 4 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The SKU '506098007' is a lingerie item (Push-up bras). Looking at the history, a significant demand regime shift occurred around late January/early February. The historical samples saw demand jump from ~11 units to ~82 units, and the experimental periods (P1-P3) have shown sustained demand of 67, 71, and 54 units respectively. The average demand over the last 5 available data points (2019-01-28 to 2019-02-25) is approximately 66.6 units per week. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have not yet reached Period 5, we haven't seen any arrivals from Period 1 orders (which are expected in the arrival phase of Period 5 per the definitions). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 266 units in transit (comprising orders from P1, P2, and P3). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this higher demand regime (approx 67 units/week * (1+L) = 335). For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=5 will provide a volatility estimate based on this higher-volume period. No evidence yet suggests actual lead time differs from promised, so L remains 'default'.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The SKU is a women's push-up bra. Historical demand shows a clear shift: the first two weeks of Jan were ~11-12, but starting Jan 21st, demand surged and has averaged 68.2 units over the last 5 weeks (concluded periods). This looks like a sustained demand regime, possibly pre-spring seasonality. Regarding inventory: On-hand is 0, and all units sold have been lost due to stockout. Total in-transit is 333 units (orders from P1-P4). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the P1 order (ordered 2019/2/11) was expected to arrive during P5 and show up in the P5 conclude message, we are exactly at the first possible delivery window. There is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or lost shipments. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 periods. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the recent regime (last 5 samples) which averages ~68. With L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+L=5) periods, so 5 * 68 = 340. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 5 samples to reflect current volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 with a lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The carry-over insight correctly notes a demand regime shift started in late Jan/Feb (avg ~62 over last 5 periods vs ~12 in initial samples). Looking at the history, demands were: 67, 71, 54, 68, 54. The mean is 62.8. Total pipeline inventory is 241 (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4). The on-hand is 38. With a promised lead time of 4, the OR backend needs to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat captures the 62.8 average (total 314 for 5 periods). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5 (z*=0), meaning the base stock stays near the mean. The cap logic will prevent over-ordering while we wait for the significant pipeline (241 units) to arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Current demand regime (P1-P5) average is 62.8 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product (Womens Lingerie) has transitioned from its initial launch phase into a stable demand regime. Since late January/early February, demand has stabilized around a mean of 60.5 units per period over the last 6 periods (67, 71, 54, 68, 54, 49). Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). The current stock position (On-hand: 77, In-transit: 188) is being replenished regularly. We will use N=6 for both demand and volatility to capture the post-launch stability without including the very low pre-launch dummy values from Jan 07-14. Profit vs. Holding cost is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will calculate based on our parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-45.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a women's push-up bra. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift that occurred in late January/early February. Since Period 1, the weekly demand has averaged 60.28 units (samples: 67, 71, 54, 68, 54, 49, 59), showing consistent and stable demand without extreme volatility. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, and 7 conclusions). I am setting L to 'default' (4). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand regime since game start (Mean = 60.3; (1+L)*Mean = 301.5). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the observed volatility in this regime. These parameters ensure the base stock levels are calculated based on the current stable demand pattern while accounting for the full lead time cycle.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P1-P7) is stable with an average of 60.3 units/period and standard deviation of ~8.5.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a push-up bra, which generally shows stable demand but can experience fluctuations. Looking at the history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). The demand regime since P1 has been relatively stable; excluding the initial low-demand samples from January, the demand from P1 to P8 is: 67, 71, 54, 68, 54, 49, 59, 85. The mean for these 8 periods is 63.375 and the standard deviation is 11.45. The most recent demand (P8) was 85, slightly higher than the average, but not yet a sustained shift. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods. \u03bc\u0302 should be approximately 5 * 63.375 = 316.875. \u03c3\u0302 should be sqrt(5) * 11.45 = 25.6. The on-hand is 86 and in-transit is 131, totaling 217. The OR backend will calculate the order based on these parameters. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this specific demand regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), on-hand inventory is 29 units. Since Period 5, we have consistently observed an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The order from Period 5 (0 units) would have arrived this period (Period 9 conclude), resulting in the observed 0 arrivals. Demand remains stable within the regime identified in Period 3, with an average demand of approximately 62.4 units over the last 9 periods (P1-P9). The standard deviation over these 9 periods is 11.23. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture this stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observed values (4, 4, 4, 4) align with the promised lead time. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a women's lingerie item (push-up bra). Demand has remained relatively stable within the previously identified regime of ~60 units/period. Over the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the mean demand is 62.2 units with a standard deviation of 13.5. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P10 arrival of the P6 order). Note that in P9, no shipment arrived because no order was placed in P5. The on-hand inventory is low (9 units), but there is a significant pipeline (250 units) covering the promised 4-period lead time. To ensure the OR backend calculates the base stock correctly for an (L+1) horizon, I am setting L to 4 and using the recent 5-period window (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the current stable-but-variable regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU 506098007 (Liza Push Bra) has entered a stockout phase (ending inventory 0, lost sales in Period 11). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P6 arrived in P10, P7 in P11). We are currently awaiting arrivals from orders placed in Period 8 (58 units) and Period 9 (83 units). The demand regime remains relatively stable since Period 1; the average demand from Period 1 to Period 11 is 61.9 units per period. Although the date is late April, there is no strong evidence of a seasonal shift yet for this specific lingerie item, though a slight upward trend in recent weeks (Period 8-11: 85, 57, 55, 52) followed by a stockout suggests we should maintain robust stock levels. I will use a recent window (N=11) to capture the stable demand mean (~62) and account for lead time (L=4). Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=11 ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level covering (1+4) periods of this demand, helping to recover the inventory position after the stockout.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 conclude, we see the arrival of the order from Period 8 (58 units, lead time 4), leaving us with 13 units on-hand. The current date is May 6. Historical demand for this women's lingerie SKU remains relatively stable. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P1-P12), the mean demand is 58.75 units with a standard deviation of approximately 10.7. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12). Note that the order from Period 5 was 0 units, explaining why P9 showed 0 arrivals. Pipeline inventory is currently 247 units (Orders from P9: 83, P10: 71, P11: 46, P12: 47). Since lead time is stable at 4, L is set to default. Mu_hat and Sigma_hat are calculated using the recent 12-period regime (P1-P12) to capture the current stable demand pattern while ignoring the significantly lower jan/early-feb pre-game samples. This avoids overreacting to minor fluctuations while maintaining a healthy stock level for the (L+1) horizon.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the product 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' is entering late spring. Historical demand since Period 1 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 57 units (excluding the initial zero-sales periods where stock was unavailable). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (e.g., Period 9 order arrived in Period 13). I am setting L to 'default' as the lead time is stable. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=9 to capture the stabilized demand regime observed over the last couple of months (Periods 5-13), which averages 55.4 units per period. This gives a total look-ahead demand (L+1=5) of approximately 277 units. Given the relatively high \u03c3 in demand (ranging between 37 and 85), I will use the last 9 samples for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for recent volatility while avoiding over-ordering during the slight dip seen in the last two weeks.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Demand for 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' lingerie has stabilized into a lower regime over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), with an average of 42.8 units/period, compared to the earlier regime avg of ~60. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 85 units, and there is a total of 144 units in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, P14). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which aligns with the base_stock target using the lead-time mean. Given the lower observed demand recently, I am shifting mu_hat to use the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the recent average of ~214 (5 * 42.8) for the 1+L window. sigma_hat will also be adjusted using recent_N to prevent overstocking as the demand volatility has also decreased.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: weekly average decreased from ~60 to ~43 units sustained over the last 5 periods (P10-P14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late May 2019. Historical demand shows a confirmed regime shift around Period 10 (mid-April), where weekly demand dropped from ~60 units to ~45 units. The last six periods (P10-P15) show remarkably stable demand: 55, 52, 45, 37, 45, 45, with an average of 46.5 units. Lead time is reliably confirmed at 4 periods across multiple delivery cycles (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, and P11 all arrived with L=4). Current on-hand (86) and in-transit (103) total 189 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~46.5, the base stock target should be around 232 units plus a safety buffer. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which allows the OR backend to adjust the order downward to avoid excess holding costs, given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand data shows a decrease in demand starting around Period 10 (mid-April), which was previously noted in carry-over insights. However, Period 16 showed a jump back to 68 units. The last 7 periods (P10-P16) have an average demand of approximately 49.6 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P12-P16) average 48 units. Given the jump in P16 to 68, I want to use a slightly more responsive window of the last 7 samples (N=7) for the mean to account for the recent volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 0.50 (z=0), meaning we primarily aim to cover the expected demand across the lead time + review period. Choosing N=7 for sigma_hat as well to capture recent standard deviation.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand data shows a regime shift occurred around Period 10 (mid-April), where average weekly demand decreased from ~60 to ~45 units. However, recent weeks (P15-P17) have shown more volatility, specifically a high of 68 in Period 16 and a low of 37 in Period 17. The carry-over insight from Period 15 noted a decrease to ~43 units, but the average of the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is actually 46.4 units. To be safe given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (50% target service level), I will maintain the mu_hat calculation based on the recent regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting N=5 for mu_hat captured the post-shift average best while accounting for recent fluctuations.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), the SKU 506098007 shows a sustained drop in demand compared to the initial high-demand period. Demand from Period 10 to 18 averaged approximately 45 units per week, with the most recent sample (Period 18) falling to 21 units. This decline suggests we should tighten our forecast to avoid excess holding costs, which are equal to unit profit ($1.00). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P10-P14. The in-transit pipeline (153 units) covers over 3 periods of the current average demand (45 units/period), and we have 58 units on hand. To prevent overstocking during this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (P10-P18) to capture the current lower-demand state while ignoring the initial high-growth phase from early 2019.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 10-18 average is ~45 units/period, down from previous ~60. P18 specifically showed a further dip to 21 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for the 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 10 (mid-April). While there was a significant dip to 21 units in Period 18, Period 19 rebounded to 38 units. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P10-P19) is approximately 44 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 12 units. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P15). I will use recent_N (N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current stabilized lower-demand regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the ~44 unit average across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), while maintaining enough safety stock for the observed volatility, thus balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level base stock level before the lead-time cap is applied).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~44 units/period (P10-P19), significantly lower than the ~60 units seen in early Spring. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. In Period 20, we experienced a stockout due to a sudden demand peak of 89 units (the highest since Period 8), while opening inventory was only 69. From Period 10 to 19, demand had settled into a lower regime averaging approx. 44 units, but Period 20's high demand (89) suggests potential high-summer volatility or a temporary spike. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 153 units, consisting of orders from P17 (66), P18 (38), P19 (14), and P20 (35). The P17 order (66 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 21. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent stockout and the high volatility observed in Period 20, I will use a recent window (N=11, covering the regime since P10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the low-demand regime and account for the recent spike. Setting mu_hat to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand will help the OR backend adjust the base stock to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high holding cost (equal to profit per unit).

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Encountered stockout; demand spiked to 89 units, the highest in 12 periods, breaking the previous stable regime of ~44 units/period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing a severe stockout due to a significant demand spike that began in Period 20 (89 units) and accelerated in Period 21 (110 units). This is a clear departure from the previous stable regime of ~44 units/period. The current date (July 8) suggests a mid-summer seasonal peak for lingerie/bras possibly tied to holiday travel or summer sales. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 165 units in transit (ordered in P18-P21). Period 18's order (38 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 22 resolution phase. Because the demand has shifted abruptly, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand trend (averaging ~79 units over P19-P21) while balancing against the possibility of a peak. Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of this higher demand is critical to recover from the stockout. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 20: Demand surged from ~44 units to an average of ~99 units/period over P20-P21 (125% increase), leading to two consecutive periods of stockouts.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 506098007 has entered a high-growth regime starting Period 20, likely due to summer seasonality for lingerie/bras. Demand has increased from ~44 units to values of 89, 110, and 169 in the last three periods. We have experienced three consecutive periods of stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0) because demand significantly exceeded local inventory and incoming shipments. The last confirmed demand (Period 22) was 169. Given the rapid acceleration (89 -> 110 -> 169), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 500 (representing a forecast of 100 units per period across L+1=5 periods) to trigger an aggressive catch-up order. Although recent demand is highly volatile, the primary goal now is to replenish stock to satisfy this higher level. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated rapidly P20-P22: 89, 110, 169 units respectively. Severe stockouts occurring; backend needs high mu_hat and sigma_hat to recover inventory position.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '506098007' (Womens Lingerie) is currently experiencing a massive demand surge starting Period 20, likely due to a mid-summer seasonal peak or promotion. The demand in the last four periods (P20-P23) has been 89, 110, 169, and 107 (average ~119 units), which is nearly triple the previous regime of ~44 units. This has led to four consecutive periods of severe stockouts (ending on-hand inventory = 0). Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we are in a replenishment deficit. I am setting L to 4 (default). For mu_hat, I'm using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new high-demand regime, which will result in (1+4)*118.75 = 593.75 for the base stock calculation. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the increased volatility during this spike (std dev is ~34.5, so sigma_hat will be sqrt(5)*34.5 \u2248 77). These high parameters are necessary to force the OR backend to place larger orders and rebuild the inventory position to meet the elevated demand and cover the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Demand surged from ~44 to ~119 units/period (P20-P23), resulting in sustained stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant seasonal demand surge (Summer peak for 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' lingerie), with demand jumping from a previous average of ~44 units to ~114 units over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). We are currently in a persistent stockout state because on-hand inventory is insufficient to cover this spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (559 units) includes larger orders placed in P22 (140), P23 (167), and P24 (174) which will arrive starting P26. To recover and maintain a high service level during this high-demand regime, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the mean demand of ~114 units over the current (L+1)=5 window. sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility (StdDev ~34 in the last 5 periods). This combination will signal the OR backend to maintain a significantly higher base stock to satisfy the current demand regime and recover from stockouts.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend shows a stabilization and potential cooling of the sharp summer peak. Weekly demand from P20-P25 was 89, 110, 169, 107, 106, 68. The most recent period (P25) showed a significant drop to 68 units, suggesting the intense mid-summer surge may be subsiding. However, the average over the last 6 periods is still approximately 108 units, which is much higher than the pre-summer average of 44. Currently, we have an on-hand inventory of 10 and a large pipeline of 503 units (from aggressive ordering in P22-P25). Given the profit/holding ratio (1:1), the OR engine target service level is 50%, but to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent demand dip, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the elevated but potentially declining summer levels. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand shows signs of cooling: Period 25 demand dropped to 68 units from a P20-P24 average of ~116.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The summer peak observed between Period 20 and Period 24 (average demand ~116) has clearly subsided. Looking at the last two periods (P25-P26), demand has dropped to 68 and 59 units respectively, suggesting a return to a more moderate regime. The inventory position has finally recovered after the sustained stockouts, with a large arrival of 140 units in Period 26 leading to an ending on-hand of 91 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P22 order arrived P26). Given the cooling demand, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P22-P26) to transition the OR backend away from the hyper-aggressive peak forecasting. While this still includes some 'peak' data from P22-P24, it helps smooth the transition and ensures we don't over-order as we enter late August, while maintaining enough safety stock to prevent another stockout if demand remains above the spring average (~45).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak conclusion: Demand has dropped for two consecutive periods (68, 59) from the P20-P24 peak average of ~116. Transitioning to a post-peak regime forecast.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P25-P27: 68, 59, 55) confirms that the summer peak (P20-P24 average ~116) has concluded and demand is returning to a more stable post-peak regime. The average demand over the last three weeks is approximately 60.7 units. With lead time stable at 4 periods, we are now entering a period where on-hand inventory (203) and pipeline inventory (251) are high due to large orders placed during the peak period. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level against potential late-summer fluctuations, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 weeks (N=3) to capture the cooling trend. Sigma_hat is also set to N=3 to reflect the lower volatility of the post-peak period. Lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: Average demand dropped to ~61 units (P25-P27) from peak average of ~116.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has stabilized into a post-peak regime. The last four periods (P25-P28) show demand levels of 68, 59, 55, and 57, averaging ~60 units per period. This is a significant drop from the summer peak (P20-P24) which averaged ~116 units. The on-hand inventory is currently high at 320 units due to the arrival of large orders placed during the stockout recovery phase. With lead time stable at 4 periods, my cycle stock and pipeline should cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current average of 60, I need ~300 units in total inventory (on-hand + in-transit). My current total is 397 (320 on-hand + 77 in-transit), which is sufficient. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this lower stable regime and allow the inventory to level off.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' has transitioned out of its summer peak (P20-P24, avg ~118) into a stable post-peak regime. Over the last five periods (P25-P29), demand has averaged 57.6 units (68, 59, 55, 57, 49), which is consistent with the pre-peak spring levels. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (293 units) relative to this demand, as large orders placed during the stockout crisis (Period 22-24) have finished arriving. With a stabilized lead time of 4 periods and demand returning to ~58 units per period, the current total pipeline (On-hand 293 + In-transit 55 = 348) covers approximately 6 periods of demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this post-peak stabilization and allow the OR backend to draw down the excess inventory by placing zero or minimal orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime stabilized (P25-P29): average demand is 57.6 units/period, returning to pre-summer levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 506098007 has stabilized in a 'post-peak' regime following the summer surge (which peaked in July). For the last 6 periods (P25-P30), demand has been consistent with a mean of 54.5 and a standard deviation of approximately 10.3. This is a significant decrease from the peak average of ~116 (P20-P24). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (282 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the stockout crisis. With a lead time of 4 periods and a weekly mean of ~55, the pipeline inventory targets roughly 275 units (5 periods of demand). Since on-hand inventory is already at 282 units, the system needs to bleed off excess inventory to avoid high holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this stable, lower demand regime, and keep L at default (4) as lead times have been consistent.

The current average over the last 7 periods is approximately 50.8 units, but the downward trend from 68 to 29 suggests a return to the pre-summer levels (approx 44 units/period) or potentially lower as we enter autumn. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 280 units with 0 in-transit, which covers more than 5 periods of forecasted demand. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the recent 7-period average to account for the cooling demand, but the backend's base-stock calculation will likely result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize against holding costs. This is appropriate given the current excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime cooling further: demand fell to 29 units in Period 31, significantly below the P25-P29 average of 57.6.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the product has settled into a lower 'post-peak' regime following the summer spike. For the last two periods (P31, P32), demand was 29 and 31 units respectively, which is significantly lower than the previous period averages (approx. 57 units in P25-P29). We are currently in a high inventory position (on-hand: 249) due to large orders placed during the stockout crisis arriving now. With demand dropping, the OR engine needs to avoid ordering more. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3, we capture the most recent cooling trend (avg ~33/period) which, combined with the current inventory, should result in zero new orders to minimize holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Demand peaked in mid-summer (P20-P24) at ~116 avg, dropped to ~57 (P25-P29), and has now fallen significantly further to ~30 units/period (P31-P32).

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we observed a massive and unexpected spike in demand for this item (142 units), significantly higher than the low-level regime (~30 units/period) observed in Periods 31-32. This spike (September 23) coincides with the 'Melbourne' product name, likely reflecting a seasonal promotion or the start of a new retail peak. While on-hand inventory is currently healthy (107 units), there are zero units in-transit, which is risky if this high demand persists into the (L+1) period horizon. The most recent demand (142) is much higher than the historical average. I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=4) to average the two low periods (29, 31) with the high spike (142) and the prior stable period (39), resulting in a mu_hat calculation of roughly (142+31+29+39)/4 * 5 = 301 units. This signals to the OR backend that our replenishment needs have increased sharply. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sudden demand spike in Period 33 (142 units), breaking the previous cooling trend (~30 units). Potential start of a Spring/Summer retail peak for lingerie.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand of 142 units in Period 33 followed by 63 units in Period 34 indicates a return of high volatility and a potential new regime, possibly a late-season spike or a promotion. While the average over the last 5 periods is 60.8, the recent peak is significantly higher. Given the high holding cost (equal to profit), the OR backend's default base-stock logic will naturally aim for a 50% service level. However, to prevent a repeat of a stockout like that seen in P33 and the summer peak, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current elevated average (approx 61 units) while maintaining the lead time at the confirmed 4 periods. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to account for the high variance introduced by the 142-unit outlier, ensuring the backend calculates a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has returned: Period 33 spiked to 142 units after 6 periods of sub-60 demand. Period 10-34 average remains approximately 56 units, but with significant seasonal or promotional swings.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 506098007 shows high volatility and evidence of seasonality. Period 33 witnessed a major demand spike (142), followed by moderate demand (63, 44). The current Period 36 starting inventory is 0 on-hand units with 260 units in-transit. Looking at the history, lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated in P5-P8, P10-P17, P20-P28). The orders from P34 and P35 (151 and 109 units respectively) are not expected to arrive until P38 and P39 based on the 4-period lead time. This puts us in a temporary stockout position. To navigate this volatility and ensure we recover quickly when shipments arrive, I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent high-variance behavior while filtering out the extremely low demand from the P30-P32 cooling phase. This should provide a mu_hat that reflects the current high-volatility regime and a sigma_hat that adequately prices in the risk of further spikes like Period 33.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 506098007 (Liza Push Bra) is currently experiencing a stockout due to a significant demand spike in Period 33 (142 units) and sustained demand around 45 units thereafter, which depleted the excess inventory from the summer peak. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since Periods 28-33 had zero orders, there was a gap in the supply pipeline. Orders placed in Periods 34 (151 units), 35 (109 units), and 36 (24 units) are currently in-transit. The order from P34 is expected to arrive in Period 38 (lead time 4). My current demand analysis shows a recent average (P34-P36) of 51.3 units/period, following the massive spike of 142 in P33. I will set L=4 (stable), mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (P33-P36) to capture the spike while acknowledging the subsequent stabilization, and a relatively high sigma_hat to protect against the high volatility observed in this item.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: following a massive spike of 142 units in P33, demand has stabilized at an average of 51.3 units (P34-P36). Current supply gap due to zero orders placed between P28-P33 is causing temporary stockouts until P34 order arrives in P38.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stockout state due to a gap in orders placed between Periods 28-33. Period 38 marks the expected arrival of the order from Period 34 (151 units), as the lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 34, demand has stabilized at a moderate level (44, 47, 40 units in P35-P37) following the massive P33 spike of 142. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent post-spike demand regime (averaging 48.5 units), ensuring we cover the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility from the P33 spike, which maintains a higher service level during this replenishment phase to avoid further stockouts.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a post-spike period following the sudden demand surge in Period 33 (142 units). Since then, demand has stabilized over the last five periods (P34-P38) with values of 63, 44, 47, 40, and 46, averaging approximately 48 units per period. The inventory position has improved as the order from Period 34 (151 units) arrived in Period 38, ending the stockout. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. With 105 units on hand and 219 units in transit (from P35, P36, and P37), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-spike demand regime while ignoring the P33 outlier. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistent 4-period lead time history.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand (P34-P38) has stabilized at an average of 48 units/period, significantly lower than the P33 outlier (142) but higher than the pre-spike level (~30).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' has stabilized after the significant outlier in Period 33 (142 units). Since Period 34, demand has followed a consistent pattern: 63, 44, 47, 40, 46, and 30 units, resulting in a 6-period post-spike average (P34-P39) of 45.0 units/period. The current inventory position is high: 184 units on-hand plus 110 units in-transit (from orders in P36 and P37), totaling 294 units. With a promise lead time of 4 periods and a current demand average of ~45, our total needs for the (L+1) window are approximately 225 units. Since 294 > 225, we have sufficient cover. I am setting mu_hat to rely on the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this stabilized post-spike regime while excluding the P33 outlier. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to capture current volatility without the distortion of the massive spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent arrivals (P38, P39).

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand (P34-P39) has stabilized at an average of 45.0 units/period, confirming a return to near-baseline levels after the P33 outlier.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P34-P40) has stabilized at an average of 41.7 units/period, down from the massive spike in Period 33. The most recent three periods (P38-P40) show a cooling trend with demand at 46, 30, and 22 units respectively. We current have 186 units on-hand and 86 units in-transit (ordered P37, expected arrival P41 or P42). Given the 1:1 profit to holding cost ratio, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially (1+L) * mean demand. With 272 units total inventory position and a mean demand of ~42, we are sufficiently covered for the next 4-5 periods (272 / 42 \u2248 6.5 periods). I will set mu_hat using the most recent 7 periods (P34-P40) to reflect the stabilized post-spike demand regime and use the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand stabilization confirmed (P34-P40): average demand is ~42 units/period, returning to pre-summer levels after the P33 outlier.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has consistently declined over the last four periods (46, 30, 22, 18), confirming the 'post-spike' stabilization and a likely seasonal drop as we move into late November. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P34-P41) is 35.6 units, but the most recent 4 periods show a clear downward trend (avg 24). On-hand inventory is high (254 units) due to the arrival of orders placed during the P33-P37 volatility phase. Given the promised lead time (4) and the current inventory level, we have enough stock to cover over 10 periods of demand at the current rate. Therefore, the OR backend should minimize new orders. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the full post-spike normalization period while allowing for the downward trend to influence the calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression confirmed: Since P38, demand has dropped consistently for 4 weeks (46 down to 18), averaging 29 units/period. Current inventory levels are extremely high relative to the cooling demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' has entered a significant cooling phase as we approach December. Over the last five periods (P38-P42), demand values were 46, 30, 22, 18, and 33, averaging approximately 29.8 units per period. This is a sharp decline from the post-spike levels of ~45 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high at 221 units, which is enough to cover over 7 periods of demand at the current rate, and there are no units in-transit. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should target the mean demand. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the current average of ~30, the required base stock is roughly 150 units. Since on-hand (221) exceeds this, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent cooling trend (last 5 periods) and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility to prevent the OR engine from over-ordering while we bleed off excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed (P38-P42): average weekly demand has dropped to ~30 units/period, down from the previous stabilization level of ~45 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU is in a significant cooling phase following the outlier spike in Period 33. Over the last six periods (P38-P43), demand has averaged approximately 26.3 units/period (46, 30, 22, 18, 33, 9). The current on-hand inventory of 212 units is extremely high, covering approximately 8 periods of demand at the current rate. Given that L=4, the pipeline + on-hand inventory should ideally cover about 5 periods (L+1) of demand. We are currently well over-stocked. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 to capture the most recent cooling regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set a lower base stock level, preventing the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while we bleed off the excess inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a cooling phase (P38-P43): weekly average has dropped to ~26 units/period, down from the previous stabilization level of ~45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-196.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 506098007 (Underwear/Bra) is currently in a significant cooling phase as we approach late December. In the most recent 5 periods (P40-P44), demand has dropped to 22, 18, 33, 9, and 8 units respectively, averaging ~18 units/period. This is a sharp decline from the ~45 units/period seen after the P33 spike. On-hand inventory is very high at 204 units, which covers over 11 weeks of current average demand. Since the game is near its end (Period 45 of 47) and lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 49, which is past the game's conclusion. Therefore, the primary objective is to minimize holding costs by preventing any further orders while satisfying remaining demand from the ample current stock. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 7-period 'cooling' regime (P38-P44, avg ~24.8) to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation remains below the current inventory plus pipeline level, effectively resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Deep winter cooling regime confirmed (P38-P44): average demand dropped to ~25 units/period, with the most recent two weeks falling below 10 units. Inventory levels are high heading into the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-164.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), approaching the final period (47) of the simulation. Current on-hand inventory is 184 units with 0 units in-transit. Demand has significantly cooled since November, averaging approximately 17.6 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P41-P45), with most recent demands being 18, 33, 9, 8, and 20. Given the current inventory of 184 and the low demand regime, the inventory is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods (46 and 47) even if a late December spike occurs. Placing orders now would only arrive in Period 50 (based on the confirmed 4-period lead time), which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no further orders are placed to minimize holding costs while maintaining a safe buffer for the final two periods. mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=8 to capture the trend since late October).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the final period (Period 47). Looking at the demand history since Period 38, we have entered a 'Deep Winter cooling regime' as identified in the carry-over insights. Recent demand samples are: 46, 30, 22, 18, 33, 9, 8, 20, 17. The average of the last 7 periods (since P40) is approximately 18.1 units. On-hand inventory is currently 167 units, with zero units in transit. Given the current on-hand inventory (167 units) and the average demand (~18 units), the stock covers over 9 weeks of demand, even though the lead time is only 4 periods. Because this is the final period of the game, and we have significant excess inventory that far exceeds even the highest recent demand spikes, no new order is required. I will maintain the current lead time estimation of lead time L=4 based on historical consistency and use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand forecasting to reflect the current winter cooling trend, though the inventory buffer is already sufficient to prevent any stockouts.
