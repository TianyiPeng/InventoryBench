Period 1 (2019/2/11) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "In Period 1, we are managing the 'Becka hoodie' (SKU 715624001). Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 37, 22, 53, 215, 302. The jump from late January to early February suggests a seasonal transition or the start of a promotion for sweatshirt/hoodie products. The OR recommendation of 333 units is based on the average and standard deviation of these five points. However, the last two data points (215 and 302) indicate a 'new normal' or rapid growth phase that the historical average (approx. 127) fails to capture fully. Given a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need enough inventory to cover the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods). If we assume demand stabilizes around 300, 5 periods of demand equals 1500 units. The OR's capped recommendation of 333 is very conservative because it uses the total historical mean. To avoid massive stockouts while the system is empty (on-hand 0, in-transit 0), I will increase the order quantity significantly above the OR cap. However, I will stay within a reasonable multiplier of the current peak (approx. 1.5x of peak demand) to mitigate overstocking risks if the trend plateaus.",

Therefore, our current on-hand inventory is 0 and will remain 0 until then.\n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand shows a significant upward trend (37 -> 22 -> 53 -> 215 -> 302). Period 1's realized demand was 131, which is lower than the most recent historical samples but confirms a high-demand regime for this hoodie. The product (Becka hoodie) is a staple garment, and February dates suggest late-winter/early-spring demand.\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. Pipeline is 450 (from P1). We are currently experiencing stockouts (Period 1 sold 0 units despite 131 demand).\n4. OR Recommendation: The OR suggests 312 units based on historical averages. However, given the extreme stockout state and the lead time of 4 periods, we need to ensure we have enough stock to cover the window between Period 6 and Period 10.\n5. Adjustment: I will follow the OR recommendation of 312. While demand has been high, we already have 450 units in the pipeline for Period 5.

Orders from P1 (450 units) and P2 (312 units) are in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. There is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods.\n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand shows a significant upward trend (37, 22, 53, 215, 302). The 'Becka hoodie' is a seasonal item (sweatshirt), and the current dates (late February) suggest we are in a peak period for hoodies. Demand in P1 and P2 was a constant 131, which is lower than the early February peak but still substantial. The current mean demand used by OR is likely reflecting the historical spikes.\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 762 (450 from P1 + 312 from P2). Total pipeline is 762. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 252 units. Given the 4-period lead time, we must cover demand for periods 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (L+1 = 5 periods). With a mean demand around 150-200, we need approx 750-1000 units to cover the pipeline. My current pipeline (762) plus the OR recommendation (252) equals 1014 units. This aligns well with a safe stock level for a 5-period window given the high profit/holding cost ratio ($19/$1).

Therefore, 'arrived=0' in history is expected and lead time appears to be on track at 4 periods.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: The SKU is a 'Becka hoodie'. Demand history shows a significant spike in late January/early February (215, 302) followed by a cooling period in late February (131, 131, 76). The average demand over the last 8 weeks (including pre-game history) is approximately 120 units/period.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 1014 units (Orders: P1=450, P2=312, P3=252). \n4. **Target Calculation**: Using a lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover demand for Period 4 plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). Estimated demand for 5 periods @ 120/period = 600 units. Even with a safety buffer for potential recovery in demand, our 1014 units in transit are more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods.\n5. **OR Recommendation**: OR recommends 0 units because the pipeline (1014) exceeds its calculated base-stock level.

Demand Analysis: The product is a 'Becka Hoodie' (soft sweatshirt fabric with brushed inside), which is highly seasonal. As we move into May (Period 13), demand for heavy sweatshirts typically declines. While Periods 11 and 12 showed a surprising spike (87 and 129 units), this contradicts the previous 6 weeks of downward-trending demand (averaging ~40 units) and the warming weather context. It's likely these spikes were temporary promotions or clearance-related, rather than a sustained shift back to winter levels.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 190 units is based on the recent demand spike, but fails to account for the current high inventory (527 units). 527 units at a demand rate of even 100 units/week covers over 5 periods of supply.

The 129 in P12 appears to be a transient spike, possibly a mid-season promotion.

However, with 459 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~60-80 units/period (at most), we currently have ~6-7 weeks of supply. Given the 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand until Period 19 (P14-P18). \n4.

Strategy: The OR recommendation of 192 units appears to be reacting to the long-term historical average but might be over-ordering given the high holding cost ($1) and the seasonal 'off-peak' nature of hoodies in summer. However, staying slightly ahead of the burn rate is safe. I will reduce the OR recommendation slightly to 150 units to account for the likely summer demand fade while maintaining a healthy safety stock.

The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely due to the large in-transit volume (749 units) relative to its calculated base stock. However, demand is consistently hitting 200 units in peak weeks. To maintain a safety buffer for the continued back-to-school season into September, I will place a moderate order of 100 units.

Historical demand shows a significant regime shift: P27 hit 322 units, but P28 dropped to 83 units. This suggests high volatility as we enter the peak hoodie season (Autumn). The 'Back-to-school' and 'Fall peak' insights suggest a higher baseline than spring/summer, likely averaging 150-200 units. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because the pipeline (698) + on-hand (118) = 816 units, which is high. However, if demand averages 200 units/period, 816 units only covers ~4 periods (L+1). With the P25 order (198 units) arriving next period (P29), the on-hand will rise to ~230+ units after demand resolution.

Assuming an average fall demand of ~150-200 units/week (based on August/September averages and seasonal category relevance), our current position covers roughly 4-6 periods.

Demand from P45-P49 must be covered by current stock and the P43 arrival. Given the 2019 January trend (starting to rise from ~40 to 200+ by late Jan), I expect demand to accelerate soon. To ensure stock for the January surge while managing holding costs as the game concludes in P47, I will slightly reduce the OR recommendation. Since the game ends at P47 and the order placed now arrives in P49 (too late for this game), any order placed now will only incur holding costs if the simulation logic evaluates ending inventory or if there's a misunderstanding of the horizon. However, following standard base-stock logic to cover the lead-time demand is safest.",

{
  "rationale": "The demand for the Becka hoodie has entered a high-volume phase, with Period 45 demand reaching 233 units. This aligns with the historical mid-winter spike observed in the historical samples (where demand went from 37 to 302 between early January and February). Current on-hand inventory is critically low at 25 units. The pipeline contains 360 units: 210 units ordered in P43 (expected P47) and 150 units ordered in P45 (expected P49). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) and the imminent risk of stockouts during a peak demand regime (estimated at ~230+ units/period), the OR recommendation of 213 units is a solid baseline for maintaining the pipeline. However, I will slightly increase the order to 240 units to ensure coverage for the projected peak throughout the lead time transition, as current inventory is nearly exhausted.",

{
  "rationale": "The inventory situation for SKU 715624001 is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 after multiple periods of high demand (P45: 233, P46: 214). Currently, there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 600 units, consisting of orders from P43 (210), P45 (150), and P46 (240). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the P43 order is expected to arrive during the current period (P47), and the P45 order will arrive in P49. Historical demand data from early January shows a major surge (302 units), and recent December performance suggests we have already entered this high-demand winter regime. While the OR's recommendation of 164 units is based on overall historical averages, the goal is to cover the lead-time replenishment cycle (L+1 = 5 periods). Current demand is running above 200 units/period. Therefore, I will increase the order to 200 units to ensure we maintain sufficient stock for the late January peak, considering we are currently stocked out and the pipeline, while large, is spaced out.",
