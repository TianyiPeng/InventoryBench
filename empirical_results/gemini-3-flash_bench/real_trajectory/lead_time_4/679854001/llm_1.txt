  "rationale": "a) Product Analysis: 'Maja Cardigan TVP' is a long-sleeved, open-knit cardigan. Given the date (Feb 11), we are in the tail end of winter and moving into early spring. Cardigans are typically popular in transitional weather. b) Demand Regime: Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a range of 1 to 7 units, with an average of approximately 4.8 units per week. The most recent data points (5, 5) suggest a stable baseline around 5 units. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is Period 1, I have no historical arrivals to measure actual lead time. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. e) Order Logic: I need to cover demand for the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (1 period), totaling 5 periods of demand. Assuming a base demand of 5 units/week, expected demand is 25 units. Considering the transition into spring/February sales, I will add a small buffer for safety stock. I will order 30 units to establish initial pipeline and stock.",

This aligns with spring transition fashion trends where light knitwear begins to sell heavily. Current inventory: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 70 (30 ordered P1, 40 ordered P2).

Lead-time coverage: We need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Current observed trend suggests a mean demand of ~50-80 units/week. Assuming 80 units/week, we need a pipeline of ~400 units. Currently, we have 70 in-transit. We have missed 97 units of sales (18+79) due to 0 inventory.

The dates (Feb/March) align with the 'Spring Transition' in retail. In the Northern Hemisphere, customers transition from heavy winter coats to lighter cardigans during this period, explaining the demand spike compared to January. (b) Demand Analysis: Pre-Feb demand was low (~5 units/week). Since Period 1 (Feb 11), demand has surged to 18, 79, and 56 (average ~51 units/week). This represents a significant regime shift. (c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (30 units) are expected to arrive in P5 (visible in P6 decision phase). Currently, no orders have arrived, which is consistent with the 4-period lead time. (d) Inventory assessment: On-hand is 0. In-transit consists of 30 (P1), 40 (P2), and 150 (P3) = 220 units.

  "rationale": "The product is a 'Maja Cardigan', a soft knitwear item. As the date is March 11, we are in the peak of the spring retail season where demand for light layers like cardigans typically spikes. Historical data from January showed demand around 5-7 units, which jumped significantly starting in February (Period 1). The recent demand sequence is 18, 79, 56, 71, averaging ~56 units/week over the last 4 periods. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Looking at the history: Period 1 order (30 units) was placed on Feb 11. According to the lead time rules, an order with L=4 placed in Period 1 arrives DURING Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and is visible/on-hand for sale in Period 6. Therefore, I currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 300 in-transit (30+40+150+80). I am experiencing stockouts and losing significant profit ($19/unit). I need to cover demand for the lead time plus the decision period (L+1 = 5 periods). At an average of 60 units/period, target pipeline is ~300. However, given the high profit-to-holding ratio (19:1), I should lean towards a higher service level to capture the spring peak. Current pipeline is 300. I expect the P1 order (30) to arrive during this period (visible P6), the P2 order (40) in P6 (visible P7), etc. I will place a moderate order to maintain the pipeline as the earliest orders begin to arrive and satisfy the backlogged demand potential.",

The product is a 'Maja Cardigan' (knitwear), which is seeing a significant late-autumn/early-winter demand decline (dropping from ~120 in September to ~21 average over the last two periods). We currently have 539 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With only 5 periods remaining (P43, P44, P45, P46, P47) and current demand levels near 20 units/period, the total expected demand for the rest of the game is approximately 100-150 units. Our current on-hand inventory (539) is more than five times the total projected remaining demand. To maximize profit and minimize holding costs, no further orders should be placed as we are already in a massive oversupply position for the final phase of the simulation.",

  "rationale": "The simulation is currently at Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019) with an end date of Period 47. There are only 5 periods remaining (43, 44, 45, 46, 47). The product is a 'Maja Cardigan' (knitwear/winter category), which experienced a fall peak in September/October followed by a significant decline in November (dropping to ~20 units). However, Period 42 showed a sudden spike to 84 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales given the late November date. Even with this spike and potential holiday demand in early December, the current on-hand inventory of 455 units is extremely high. Assuming an average remaining demand of 50-80 units per period, the total remaining demand for the simulation is approximately 250-400 units. With 455 units already in stock and 0 in transit, the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining periods. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs ($1.0/unit) at the end of the game, reducing total profit. Therefore, no additional units will be ordered.",

Even at a conservative estimate of 100 units per period\u2014which is far higher than recent realized demand\u2014the 422 units currently in stock would cover the entire remaining duration of the game. Ordering any more units would only result in unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period) and zero additional profit since the current stock already satisfies all possible future demand.

Recent demand has been significantly declining since the autumn peak, with the last few periods showing demand of 22 (P41), 84 (P42 - likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday outlier), 33 (P43), and 35 (P44). Even at a generous average demand of 40 units per period, the total required stock for the final 3 periods is approximately 120 units. With 387 units on hand, we already have a massive surplus (coverage for ~9-10 periods). Any additional orders would only incur further holding costs and will never arrive in time to be sold.

Given the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 46) would not arrive until Period 50, which is well after the simulation ends. Furthermore, holding costs are $1.0 per unit.
