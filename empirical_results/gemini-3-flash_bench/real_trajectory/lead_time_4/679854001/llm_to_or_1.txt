Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 679854001 is a 'Maja Cardigan TVP', a knitwear item. Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 4.8 units/week (1, 6, 7, 5, 5). Given the date is mid-February, we are approaching the transition from winter to spring, where light knitwear like cardigans typically remains relevant. The promised lead time is 4 periods. With on-hand and in-transit inventory at 0, we need to establish a base stock to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the post-holiday baseline observed in January/early February. For lead time, I will use 'default' (4 periods) as no historical arrival data is available yet to suggest a drift.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a 'Maja Cardigan', a knitwear item appropriate for the current late-winter/early-spring transition. In Period 1, we saw a demand of 18 units, which is significantly higher than the 5-week pre-game training data (range 1-7, avg 4.8). This suggests a strong regime shift or seasonal spike as spring collections gain traction. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 9 units in transit (ordered P1, promised lead time 4). Since the current demand (18) is much higher than the historical average (4.8), I will use the recent_N method with N=1 to capture the most recent information (the P1 demand of 18) to inform mu_hat. This will help the base-stock calculation adjust upwards to prevent future stockouts once the pipeline arrives. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with a small window to reflect the increased volatility seen in the jump from ~5 to 18.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 1: demand increased from an average of 4.8 to 18 units (+275%).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679854001 (Maja Cardigan) is experiencing a massive demand surge. The pre-game average was ~4.8 units, but over the last two periods, demand exploded to 18 and then 79 units. This coincides with late February, suggesting early spring shopping for light knitwear. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 31 units in transit (9 from P1, 22 from P2). With a promised lead time of 4, the P1 order isn't expected until P5 conclude. Because the current demand (79) far exceeds recent predictions and our pipeline (31), we need to aggressively increase the base stock. I will use a recent_N calculation for mu_hat based on the last 2 periods to capture this regime shift (avg ~48.5) and setting N=2 for sigma to account for the high volatility. L remains default as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand surged from avg ~5 units to 48.5 units over P1-P2 (+870%), likely due to seasonal spring knitwear demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product (Maja Cardigan) is a seasonal knitwear item entering the spring season. Historical demand before Period 1 was low (~5 units), but recent demand has surged significantly: P1=18, P2=79, P3=56 (average of ~51 units over the last 3 periods). Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (9 units) should arrive in P5, P2 (22 units) in P6, and P3 (120 units) in P7. On-hand remains 0, leading to stockouts. To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent demand surge (avg 51). For sigma_hat, I will use the last 3 periods to account for the increased volatility. For lead time (L), I will use the promised 'default' of 4 as we have not yet reached the arrival point of our first order to confirm any drift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand over P1-P3 is 51 units, confirming a sustained high-demand period for the spring season compared to the pre-P1 average of 4.8.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a knitwear cardigan, currently in its peak spring season. Historical lead time is promised at 4 periods. The order from Period 1 (9 units) was placed with a promised lead time of 4, meaning it should arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in Period 6's conclude message. Currently, on-hand is 0 and we have 253 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4). Demand has shifted dramatically from the pre-game average (~5) to a recent average of 56 units (last 4 periods: 18, 79, 56, 71). To ensure we cover the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new regime. mu_hat will target approx (1+4) * 56 = 280. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility (std dev) of this higher demand level. No orders are 'overdue' yet as the first game-order (P1) is only expected to arrive this period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Maja Cardigan' (knitwear), currently in its peak spring season. Historical demand since Period 1 shows a significant regime shift: demand has averaged 62.4 units per period (18, 79, 56, 71, 88), which is significantly higher than the initial pre-Period 1 baseline of ~5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first observation from the 'conclude' messages confirms this: the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (88) far exceeded the small arrival (9). We have 345 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), with the P2 order (22 units) expected to arrive this period (P6). To ensure we cover demand over the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (Review period=1), we need a mu_hat that reflects the high seasonal demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full extent of this 'spring' regime.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand regime for spring knitwear remains high, averaging 62.4 units over periods 1-5.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25) falls within the peak spring demand season for this 'soft, loose knit' cardigan. Demand has consistently increased since Period 1 (18, 79, 56, 71, 88, 105), with a recent 3-period average of 88 units. The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (matches promised), as seen by arrivals for orders from P1 and P2. We are currently out of stock because initial orders were too small for the massive demand surge, so we need to set aggressive parameters. I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the high-demand regime since P1, which averages ~69.5 units per period. For L=4, mu_hat should cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand, roughly 350-400 units. The OR backend will subtract the 392 units in-transit. By using recent_N, the backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * 69.5 = 347.5, which aligns with covering the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 4-6 average demand increased to 88 units (+27% vs P1-P5 avg), indicating peak season acceleration for knitwear.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a soft knit cardigan, which is in peak demand during the spring season. Historical data shows a clear upward trend: Demand in Period 7 was 110 units, following a trend of 18, 79, 56, 71, 88, and 105. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P5-P7) is 101 units, significantly higher than the overall average. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrival of Period 1, 2, and 3 orders. Currently, we have 10 units on-hand and 339 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). To prevent stockouts during this peak season, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this 100+ units/period regime. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, which at ~101 units/period equals ~505 units. With 339 in-transit + 10 on-hand (349 total), the system should place an additional order to bridge the gap and satisfy the high target service level (q = 19/20 = 95%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak confirmed: Period 5-7 average demand increased to 101 units (+15% vs P4-P6), indicating continued spring peak for knitwear.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. We are in the peak season for the 'Maja Cardigan', a soft knitwear item suitable for spring. Historical demand has surged significantly from an average of ~5 units pre-Period 1 to a recent average of 125 units over the last 3 periods (P6-P8: 105, 110, 161). The demand in P8 (161 units) indicates we are currently in the height of the spring peak. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived with exactly 4 periods lead time). My strategy is to set L to the default (promised 4) and use a 'recent_N' of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-growth peak period. A base stock calculation using L=4 covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~125, mu_hat should reflect approximately 625 units over the lead+review period. Using N=3 will allow the OR backend to quickly adapt to the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring we maximize service levels for this high-profit ($19) versus low-holding-cost ($1) item.

Carry-over insight: Peak season surge confirmed: Average demand for P6-P8 increased to 125.3 units (+42% vs P4-P6 avg), signaling the height of the spring knitwear season.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Maja Cardigan TVP' is in the peak of its spring retail season (mid-April). Demand has been consistently high and volatile, with the last period showing 108 units and the period before 161. The current average demand over the last 3 periods (P7-P9) is approx 126 units (110, 161, 108). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 433 units in transit (scheduled arrivals: P10=69, P11=67, P12=120, P13=177). To satisfy the high spring demand and high profit margin ($19), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods of demand (P6-P9) which covers the acceleration and peak (Avg: (105+110+161+108)/4 = 121). Multiplying by (1+L) = 5, mu_hat = 605. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility.

Demand dropped from a high of 161 (Period 8) to 108 (Period 9) and 77 (Period 10), marking a clear cooling trend as the weather warms. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 0 on-hand and 529 units in-transit (P7 order of 67, P8 order of 120, P9 order of 177, P10 order of 165), supply is starting to catch up to the previous peak orders just as demand is softening. To avoid excessive overstocking as the season ends, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (average demand P8-P10 = 115.3) to capture this downward shift while still providing a safety buffer, and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Average demand dropped from 125.3 (P6-P8) to 115.3 (P8-P10), signaling the transition out of the spring peak for knitwear.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a spring/loose knit cardigan (Maja Cardigan TVP), which traditionally sees high demand in early spring (February-April) and starts to decline as warmer summer weather approaches in May. Historical demand data shows a clear peak in Period 8 (April 1st) with 161 units, followed by a decline and stabilization. The recent demand for Periods 9-11 was 108, 77, and 116 (average ~100). The last Period (11) showed a slight uptick to 116, but overall the regime is lower than the 125+ average seen during the peak. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P7 order arrived P11). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory due to stockouts, but 648 units in-transit (P8 order of 120, P9 order of 177, P10 order of 165, and P11 order of 186). Since the 'In-transit' includes the order placed just last period (P11), the backend will see high pipeline inventory. I will set L to 'calculate' as it consistently shows 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the post-peak stabilization (~100 units/period) while avoiding the outlier peak of 161. For sigma_hat, N=5 is used to capture the volatility during this transitional phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak stabilization: Average demand for P9-P11 is approximately 100.3 units, confirming a shift away from the 125+ peak levels but remaining significantly higher than pre-February levels.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-06. The SKU (Maja Cardigan) is a knitwear item transitioning out of its spring peak. Recent demand (P12: 137, P11: 116, P10: 77) shows significant volatility but remains high, averaging 110 units over the last 3 periods. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 528 units, which covers approximately 4.8 periods of the current average demand (110). Since L=4, my target coverage should be (L+1)=5 periods. The pipeline is nearly sufficient, but because of the stockouts (P12 sold 120 vs demand 137), I need to ensure the parameters reflect the current regime to trigger appropriate replenishment. mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the post-peak but still elevated demand levels (approx 110 units/period * 5 periods = 550 total). L is kept at default as the promised 4 periods matches observed behavior.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). As identified in carry-over insights, the 'Maja Cardigan' (a knitwear item) has passed its spring peak which reached ~125 units per period. Recent demand has cooled: P13 demand was 66, and the average over the last 3 periods (P11-P13) is 106.3 units, down from the peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P13). On-hand inventory is 111 units, with a large pipeline of 463 units (orders from P10-P13). Since we have enough stock to cover roughly 4 periods of recent average demand in the pipeline and on-hand, the OR backend needs parameters that reflect this cooling demand to avoid over-ordering as we move toward summer. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu and sigma to capture this post-peak regime while maintaining a buffer for late-spring variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction confirmed: Average demand for P11-P13 dropped to 106.3 units from the P6-P8 peak of 125.3 units, signaling a transition toward summer seasonality for knitwear.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is the Maja Cardigan (Divided Collection), typically a spring/autumn layering piece. Historical demand analysis shows a peak reached in April (P8-P11 average ~123 units) which has since softened to a more stable level as we approach summer (P12-P14 average ~105 units). In-transit inventory (335 units) is significant, consisting of orders from P11, P13, and P14, all expected to arrive within the next 4 periods given the consistent observed lead time of 4. With on-hand inventory at 162 and demand showing a downward trend from peak levels, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the current post-peak regime (avg ~105 units), which results in a mu_hat of approx 525 for the 5-period horizon (L+1). L is maintained at the promised/observed value of 4. This approach prevents over-ordering as seasonality for this knitwear item likely continues to cool down towards summer.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a soft knit cardigan, which typically sees high demand in early spring and drops off as summer approaches. Recent demand history shows: P12=137, P13=66, P14=114, P15=162. While there was a spike in P15, the overall trend since the late March/Early April peak (P8=161) has been fluctuating downward. We are moving into the summer months (June/July) where demand for knitwear typically decreases significantly. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 186 units, and there are 314 units in transit (specifically from orders in P13, P14, and P15). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high carry-over of inventory and the pending arrivals, I am setting mu_hat using a 5-period average (N=5) to capture the recent volatility while planning for the seasonal cooldown. Sigma_hat is set using N=5 to reflect the high recent variance.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 (2019/6/3). The product is a soft-knit cardigan, which is transitioning from a high-demand spring peak into the summer season. Recent demand has been volatile but significant: P14 (114), P15 (162), and P16 (142). The average demand over the last 3 periods is approx 139 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since P12 was a zero-order period, we saw no arrival in P16, which depleted on-hand inventory to 44 units. However, the order from P13 (112 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 17 resolution. Our pipeline inventory is currently 492 units. To prevent stockouts during this sustained demand phase while acknowledging the eventual seasonal decline, I will set mu_hat using a recent 4-period window (N=4) to capture the current demand level (~138/week) over the 5-week review + lead time horizon. This sets a base stock level that accounts for the transition out of the spring peak while maintaining safety stock (sigma_hat) based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at elevated levels: Average demand for P14-P16 is 139.3 units, maintaining higher volume than expected for early summer despite earlier signs of softening.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, entering the summer season for the 'Maja Cardigan'. Historical demand shows that while the spring peak (April) reached ~125 units, demand has remained surprisingly resilient through May and early June, averaging 141.2 units over the last 5 periods (P13-P17). On-hand inventory is low (26 units) and there is a conspicuous gap in the pipeline: the order from Period 12 (0 units) arrived in Period 16, resulting in zero arrivals that period. This created a stock-out risk that was mitigated by prior inventory. The order from Period 14 (37 units) is expected to arrive this period (P18), which is significantly lower than current demand levels. To maintain high service levels for the sustained demand of ~140 units, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture this latest 'high summer' demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (2019/6/17), the SKU 679854001 (Maja Cardigan) is experiencing a stockout with On-hand inventory at 0. Demand remains high, with the last 5 periods (P14-P18) averaging 133 units, which is higher than the early summer softening previously anticipated. Crucially, the order placed in Period 12 (ordered=0) has concluded, and we are still awaiting the arrival of the order from Period 15 (165 units), which is expected to arrive during this period (P19) given the confirmed lead time of 4. There is also a significant 'missing' order from Period 12 (quantity was 0), which explains the recent 'arrived=0' message in Period 16. To address the persistent stockouts and high demand, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the current plateau of ~133 units/period, and setting L to the promised 4 periods, which is consistent with historical arrivals. This ensures the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the total lead time plus review period (5 periods) at the current demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Average demand for P14-P18 is 133 units, maintaining high volume through mid-June despite initial signs of softening in May.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a lightweight cardigan, which typically sees sustained demand through the spring and summer months. Looking at recent demand history (P14-P19), the average is approximately 130 units per period (133 units avg for P14-P18). Although Period 19 showed a slight dip to 116 units, most recent demand remains consistently high compared to early Spring. Period 12's order (0 units) caused a significant stockout gap that we are still recovering from, evidenced by the high in-transit volume (573 units). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P15 order arrived in P19). I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this summer plateau of ~130 units per period, and sigma_hat similarly to reflect current volatility. This configuration helps the OR backend maintain a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (5 periods total coverage).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/07/01), the product (Maja Cardigan) is entering the high summer season. Demand has cooled slightly from the mid-June peak but remains robust, averaging 112.7 units over the last three periods (P18-P20). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods (P16 order arrived in P20). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P16-P20 avg demand = 122 units), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers approximately 5 periods of these current demand levels. This should maintain a high service level while the cardigan transitions through the summer months.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at summer levels: Period 16-20 average demand is 122 units, showing a slight decrease from the mid-June peak but remaining consistently high.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is a knitwear cardigan, which typically sees high demand in spring and early summer but may begin to shift as we move deeper into the summer months. Demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has averaged 114.2 units, showing a slight softening from the mid-June peak (~133 units) but remaining relatively stable. I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture this current summer stabilization while being responsive to any downward trend. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods consistently. One order from Period 12 for 0 units and one from Period 16 (178 units) have concluded, while more recent orders (P18-P21) are still in transit. On-hand inventory is healthy at 209 units. Using L=4, mu_hat with recent_N=5 (captures the last month's average), and sigma_hat with recent_N=5 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed: Mid-June average demand of ~133 (P14-P18) has decreased to ~114 units (P17-P21), representing a 14% softening as the season progresses into July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for the Maja Cardigan (Knitwear) is showing a slight softening trend as we move further into summer, with the average demand for the last 5 periods (P18-P22) at approximately 113.6 units, compared to the peak mid-June levels of ~133. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by the arrival of P18's order in P22). There is a significant amount of inventory currently available (234 on-hand + 250 in-transit). The in-transit inventory consists of orders from P19 (53), P20 (116), P21 (30), and P22 (51). To avoid overstocking while demand softens, I will use a recent window (N=5) to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, capturing the current post-peak demand regime. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a loose-knit cardigan. Historical data shows demand has transitioned from a spring peak (averaging ~125 units in Periods 6-8) to a stable summer range (averaging ~111 units in Periods 20-23). Specifically, the last four periods of demand were 105, 103, 127, and 104, demonstrating a consistent and slightly lower-than-peak volume (average of 109.75). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods, with the exception of Period 12 which was a zero-order week; however, the pipeline is intact with orders from Periods 20, 21, 22, and 23 in-transit. On-hand inventory is healthy at 183 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime of July, which is slightly softer than the June/Spring peak but remains steady. For lead time, I will continue using the promised 'default' of 4 as it is consistently validated by arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in July: Average demand for P20-P23 reached 109.8 units, confirming a 12% reduction from the late-spring peak of 125 units, establishing a new baseline for the mid-summer period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are managing 'Maja Cardigan TVP', a knitwear item. Historically, lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. Since P20, demand has stabilized around a lower baseline compared to the spring peak (averaging ~109 units over P20-P23), with the most recent demand being 91 units. As we enter late July/August, knitwear demand typically undergoes a transition. Current pipeline inventory (293) and on-hand (208) total 501 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current average. To prevent overstocking as the season potentially winds down further, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (~106 avg) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. Lead time remains 'default' (4) as no deviations are observed.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. The product is a soft cardigan, which typically sees high demand in spring/fall. Demand has shown a steady decline from the June peak (~133 units) down to about 90 units in late July as the summer season progresses. Specifically, the average demand of the last 4 periods (P22-P25) is approximately 101 units, while the most recent two periods (P24-P25) have dropped to 86.5 units. Given we are in early August, I expect demand to stabilize or slightly decrease further before the autumn uptick. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 156 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to reflect this late-summer stabilization while maintaining enough coverage for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction in late summer: Average demand for P22-P25 dropped to 101 units, with the most recent two periods (P24-P25) averaging 86.5 units, marking a transition from mid-summer peak levels.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for the Maja Cardigan (Knitwear) is in a sustained late-summer contraction. The average demand over the last four periods (P23-P26) is 91.5 units, down from the June peak of ~133 units. The most recent demand (P26) was 89 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P22 order arriving in P26). With on-hand inventory at 118 and a substantial pipeline of 363 units (total coverage of 481), the current position is Long. Our goal is to set parameters that reflect the current lower demand regime (approx. 90 units/period) to avoid excessive holding costs as the season winds down. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction sustained: Average demand for P23-P26 is 91.5 units, confirming a shift from mid-summer levels (~110) to a lower late-summer baseline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The product is a soft knit cardigan, which typically sees high demand in spring and a secondary peak or stabilization in autumn. Historical data shows demand peaked in April/May (avg ~125), softened in July (avg ~110), and is currently contracting in August (last 4 periods avg ~90.5). However, August often marks the start of the 'Pre-Fall' shopping season for light knitwear. Period 27 demand was 100, slightly up from the previous three periods (91, 82, 89), suggesting a stabilization near the 90-100 units/period mark. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 138 units on-hand and 254 in-transit (covering orders from P24-P27), the total pipeline is 392. For a 4-period lead time plus current period (L+1=5), we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the recent_N (N=4) method for mu_hat tracks the late-summer contraction, but I will monitor for an autumn uptick soon.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Demand for the Maja Cardigan (Knitwear) has stabilized at a lower late-summer baseline. Over the last four periods (P25-P28), demand has been 82, 89, 100, and 92, averaging approximately 90.75 units. This is a clear contraction from the mid-summer average of ~110 and the late-spring peak of ~125. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P28 arrived P24 order). With on-hand inventory at 138 and 250 units in-transit, the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand regime. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized late-summer demand baseline (N=max(min(4, 20), 3)).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late-summer baseline: Average demand for P25-P28 is 90.75 units, confirming a 17% reduction from the mid-summer baseline (~110 units).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Demand for the late-summer/early-autumn period (P25-P29) has stabilized around an average of 95.6 units per period, showing a slight uptick in the most recent period (115 units), which may indicate the start of a transition into the autumn season for knitwear. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 100 units, with 267 units in transit. To maintain appropriate stock levels for this stabilized regime and potential early autumn demand, I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering the late-summer period from P25 onwards). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current (~95 unit) baseline rather than the higher mid-summer peaks (~125 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 95.6 units during the late-summer period (P25-P29), down from mid-summer peaks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for the Maja Cardigan (Knitwear) has stabilized at a late-summer/early-autumn baseline. Over the last five periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 103 units, showing a slight uptick from the late-August low, potentially signaling stable early-autumn demand. Lead times remain consistently 4 periods (P26 order arrived in P30). Inventory levels are healthy with 310 units in transit and 55 on-hand. Given that the product is a cardigan, we should expect demand to remain stable or slightly increase as autumn progresses, but for now, we align with the recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late summer/early autumn (P26-P30 mean: 103 units), up slightly from the late August baseline (~90 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019, which marks the transition into the early autumn season. The product is a knitted cardigan, which typically sees increased demand as temperatures drop. Recent demand from Period 27 to 31 (100, 92, 115, 119, 106) shows a sustained upward trend compared to the late-August baseline, with an average of approximately 106.4 units over the last 5 periods. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 425 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P28, P29, P30, P31). To avoid stockouts during this potential autumn uptick, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the current demand level of ~106 units per period, while maintaining the default lead time of 4. This will set a base stock level targeting approximately 530 units (5 * 106) across the lead-plus-review window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand uptick confirmed: Average demand for P27-P31 increased to 106.4 units from the late-summer baseline of ~90 units (+18%), signaling the start of the autumn knitwear season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019, which marks the start of the autumn retail season. Demand for the Maja Cardigan (knitwear) has shown a sustained uptick, increasing from a late-summer baseline of ~90 units to an average of 106.4 units over the last 5 periods (P27-P31). The most recent period (P32) saw demand at 101 units, while the period before (P30) peaked at 119. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) due to arrivals being slightly lower than demand (88 arrived vs 101 demand). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the transition into cooler autumn weather and the 'Divided Collection' (fast-fashion/trend-focused) nature of the product, I expect demand to remain elevated or continue to rise slightly. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 periods) to capture this autumn regime (mean ~108 units) while ensuring the OR backend targets the appropriate service level (95%+ as profit:holding is 19:1). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for recent demand volatility (approx 10-12 units).

Carry-over insight: Autumn Demand Regime Shift: Average demand from P28-P32 is 108.4 units, representing a 20% increase over the late-August baseline (approx 90 units), confirming seasonal growth for knitwear.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, which aligns with the transition into the autumn peak for knitwear. Recent demand history (P31-P33: 106, 101, 136) confirms an upward trend, with an average of 114 units over the last three periods, surpassing the late-summer baseline of ~90 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and shipments have consistently arrived with a 4-period lead time. Pipeline inventory (479 units) covers roughly 4 periods of recent demand, but given the stockouts in P31-P33 and the seasonal uptick, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 5-period regime (approx. 115 units/period) to better capture the autumn acceleration. L remains at the stable confirmed value of 4. sigma_hat is set using recent_N to account for increased volatility during seasonal shifts.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter transition confirmed: Average demand for P31-P33 increased to 114.3 units (+26% vs late-summer baseline P25-P28), signaling a shift from autumn to winter peak for knitwear.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019, which is entering the peak autumn/winter season for knitwear (Maja Cardigan). Demand has shown a consistent upward trend since the late-summer baseline (~90 units). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P32-P34) is 118.7 units, and the single most recent period (P34) saw demand of 119. To capture this shift while protecting against stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to weight the most recent peak activity. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to capture the increased volatility of the seasonal transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' message (Period 30 order arrived in Period 34). This strategy aims to ensure the pipeline covers approximately 5 periods of elevated demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak confirmed: Demand for P32-P34 averaged 118.7 units, a significant increase from the 95-103 range seen in early September, signaling peak capacity for knitwear.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October (2019/10/14), a period typically seeing sustained demand for knitwear like the Maja Cardigan as temperatures drop. However, Period 35 demand (84 units) was lower than the previous three-period average (P32-P34: 118.7 units), suggesting high volatility or a potential temporary lull rather than a regime downshift. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 31 order. On-hand inventory is 42, and there are 522 units in transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level. To capture the recent autumn/winter trajectory while accounting for the recent high volatility, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 (P31-P35) to average out the recent high surge and the Period 35 dip, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 105 units per period for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent increase in demand variance.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is the Maja Cardigan, a knitwear item. Current date is October 21, 2019. Historically, demand for this item spiked during spring (P5-P15) and is showing signs of a secondary peak/sustained demand as we enter the autumn/winter season. Recent demand (P34-P36) has softened slightly (119, 84, 79) compared to the late-September peak (136). The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 100 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P32 order arrived P36). With 88 on-hand and 451 in-transit, there is significant pipeline inventory. To avoid overstocking while the seasonal trend stabilizes, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent softening while maintaining a safety buffer for potential winter spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-autumn peak softening: Average demand for P34-P36 is 94 units, down from the P31-P33 average of 114 units, suggesting a potential stabilization or 'lull' between autumn and deep winter demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1281.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for the Maja Cardigan has entered a post-autumn peak softening phase as noted in Period 37. Average demand for the last three periods (P35-P37) is 79 units (84, 79, 74), which is a significant drop from the P31-P33 average of 114.3. This likely represents a seasonal lull before potentially picking up for the deep winter/holiday season. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 125 units and a healthy pipeline of 408 units (total 533 units), and current demand trending downwards to around 75-80 units/period, we are well-covered for the ~5 period horizon (L+1). I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P34-P37) to capture this recent softening more accurately while maintaining a safety buffer in sigma_hat to account for any unexpected winter surges. Setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR backend on this new lower demand regime (~78 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed in late October: Average demand for P35-P37 dropped to 79 units, a 31% decrease from the P31-P33 average of 114 units, indicating the end of the early-autumn peak for knitwear.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Maja Cardigan (Knitwear) is in a confirmed contraction phase as we move into November. Recent demand reflects this: P35 (84), P36 (79), P37 (74), and P38 (52). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P36-P38) is 68.3 units, significantly lower than the early-autumn peak of ~114-118 units. Current inventory status: On-hand (211) + In-transit (270) = 481 units. With the projected demand softening (around 60-70 units/period), the current pipeline covers approximately 7 periods of demand, which exceeds the required coverage for a 4-period lead time (L+1=5). To minimize holding costs while the demand regime settles into a lower late-autumn/winter baseline, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction confirmed in late October/early November: Average demand for P36-P38 dropped to 68.3 units, a 40% decrease from the September peak (~114), indicating a seasonal shift for knitwear.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. The demand for product 679854001 (Knitwear Cardigan) is in a significant contraction phase as we move into late autumn. Historical demand over the last 4 periods (P36-P39) has been 79, 74, 52, and 41, showing a clear weekly decline. The average for the last three periods (P37-P39) is 55.7 units, compared to the early-autumn peak of ~114 units. We currently have 318 units on-hand and 122 units in-transit (from orders in P36 and P37). This total pipeline of 440 units is extremely high relative to the falling demand (approx. 8 periods of cover at current rates). Lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and declining demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the downward trend and allow the OR backend to restrict further ordering until the stock level normalizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction confirmed: Average demand dropped from 114.3 (P31-P33) to 55.7 (P37-P39), a 51% decrease, marking the end of the autumn peak and transition into the winter season.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Maja Cardigan is in a sharp contraction phase as we move deeper into November (late autumn/early winter). Demand has dropped from a peak of ~114 units (P31-P33) to just 20 units in Period 40. The last three periods (P38-P40) averaged 37.7 units, and the most recent observation is only 20. With 352 units on-hand and 68 in-transit (total 420), and demand plummeting, we are significantly overstocked. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the contemporary low-demand regime. Given the current inventory covers over 10-20 weeks of current demand levels, the OR backend will correctly continue to place zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction confirmed: Average demand dropped from 114.3 (P31-P33) to 37.7 (P38-P40), a 67% decrease, marking the end of the autumn peak and a very slow start to winter.

This represents a 75% contraction, likely due to the end of the knitwear peak season. Currently, we have 398 units on-hand and zero in-transit. Given the recent demand average of ~27 units, our current inventory covers approximately 14 weeks of supply, which is far in excess of the (L+1) target of 5 weeks (approx 135 units). Therefore, I am maintaining zero orders by setting 'mu_hat' to a very low value relative to our current inventory. I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent, sharply lower demand regime and prevent additional holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction sustained: Periodic average demand fell to 27.7 units (P39-P41), a 75% decrease from the autumn peak. Elevated inventory (398 units) now significantly exceeds expected demand for the remainder of the year.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '679854001' (Maja Cardigan) is in a sharp seasonal decline as we approach the end of the year. Demand for P42 was 84 units, but the average over the last 3 periods (P40-P42) is only 42 units, signaling a significant drop from the autumn peak. We are currently in Period 43 of 47, with only 5 periods remaining in the game. On-hand inventory is 314 units, which is enough to cover over 7 periods of demand at the current 3-period average rate (42 units/period), or approximately 3.7 periods even at the higher P42 demand level. Given that the promised lead time (L=4) means any order placed now would only arrive in Period 47 (the final period), and we already have a massive inventory surplus that exceeds expected demand for the remainder of the game, I will continue to set orders to zero. The parameters L and sigma_hat are set to default, while mu_hat is set to a recent average (N=3) to reflect the contraction and prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary orders due to older, higher demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction confirmed: Average demand for P40-P42 is 42 units, a 64% decrease from the autumn peak (P31-P33 avg: 114.3). Inventory surplus (314 units) is sufficient for the remaining 5 periods of the game.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 of 47. The product is a knitwear cardigan, and historical demand data combined with the calendar confirms we have moved past the autumn peak and into a late-year contraction phase. The recent average demand (P41-P43) has dropped significantly to approximately 46.3 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 281 units, with 54 units in-transit (ordered in P43). Given that there are only 4 periods remaining in the game (P44, P45, P46, P47), the total expected demand for the rest of the simulation is approximately 185 units (46.3 * 4). Our current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit = 335) already vastly exceeds this expected demand. Placing further orders would only increase holding costs without contributing to sales. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-period regime to reflect the lower demand wall, but the OR backend's inventory balancing will correctly prevent ordering because our net inventory is well above any reasonable base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction finalized: Average demand for P41-P43 is 46.3 units, confirming a sustained low-demand period for the end-of-year season. Existing inventory is sufficient to cover all remaining periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 out of 47 (Final period is 47). The product is a soft knit cardigan, which has transitioned from an autumn peak (avg ~114) into a low-demand winter baseline (avg ~43 since P40). Current on-hand inventory is 246 units, and there are 73 units in-transit (54 from P43, 19 from P44). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P45) will arrive in Period 49 (P45+4), which is after the game ends. Therefore, ordering more is futile and only incurs holding costs. Existing on-hand inventory (246) is more than sufficient to cover the projected demand for the final three periods (P45, P46, P47), even at the higher end of the current demand regime. I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed by the OR backend.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the penultimate period (Period 46 out of 47). Current on-hand inventory is 219 units, and there are 73 units in-transit (ordered in P43 and P44). Total inventory available to cover the remaining periods is 292 units. Historical demand for the most recent 3 periods (P43-P45) has averaged 31.7 units. With only two demand cycles left (the remainder of P46 and P47), the current inventory far exceeds any realistic demand forecast (approx. 64 units needed vs 292 available). Any further ordering would only increase holding costs without contributing to additional sales. I am setting parameters to ensure no further orders are placed, as the surplus is already substantial.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47, which is the final period of the game (Date: 2019/12/30). The current on-hand inventory is 188 units and there are 73 units in-transit. Over the last 5 periods (P42-P46), demand has averaged 42 units per period (84, 33, 35, 27, 31). Given that this is the final decision phase, any order placed now will arrive in 4 periods (long after the game ends). My primary objective is to maximize R_t by managing the existing stock. The current on-hand inventory of 188 units is more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand (which follows the late-year low-demand regime of ~30-40 units). Placing an additional order would only decrease the final reward by unnecessarily increasing in-transit pipeline or risk increasing holding costs if the backend considers ending inventory. More importantly, since the game ends after this period's resolution, ordering 0 is the only logical choice to maximize net profit. I will set the mu_hat to 0 to ensure the backend does not place an order.
