Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is standard 'Band leggings' (Womens Everyday Basics). Observed historical demand (samples from Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a very stable pattern: 100, 92, 103, 104, 99. The mean is approximately 99.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 4.7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no on-hand inventory and no in-transit units yet, the OR engine needs to place an initial order. I will use the 'default' method for lead time (L=4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stable demand regime. This will set the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~500 units).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Band leggings', a jersey basic in women's everyday staples. Historical demand (5 samples provided: 100, 92, 103, 104, 99) is stable with a mean of 99.6. At Period 1 conclude, we saw a demand of 92, which aligns with historical averages. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (108 units) is in-transit (promised lead time L=4). Per the sequence of events, this order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in Period 6's decision phase. Since we have zero on-hand and 108 in-transit, we need to maintain the pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (incorporating the 5 initial samples + the Period 1 demand of 92) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. L will remain at the promised 'default' of 4.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Evaluation of history: Demand in Period 1 (92) and Period 2 (138) suggests a potential upward trend or volatility compared to the initial samples (avg ~99.6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed Period 1) has a promised lead time of 4, meaning it is not expected until Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Total in-transit is 215 (108 from P1 + 107 from P2). I will use L=4 (promised). For mu_hat, considering the spike to 138 in P2, I'll use recent_N with N=5 to incorporate the latest higher demand while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture increased variance. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Women's Everyday Leggings. Historical demand samples (pre-Period 1) averaged ~100. Since Period 1, observed demand has been 92, 138, and 124 (mean ~118), suggesting a slight upward shift. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (108 units), P2 (107 units), and P3 (137 units) are currently in-transit (Total 352). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order placed at the start of P1 should arrive during P5 (P1+4) and be visible at the start of P6. Consequently, current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are experiencing lost sales. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand increase using recent_N=3 (average ~118) scaled by (1+L). With L=4, mu_hat = 5 * 118 = 590. Sigma_hat will be calculated using the same recent period to capture the increased volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is 'Band leggings', an everyday basic item. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory has been 0 since the start, and all demand (roughly 100-140 units per week) has been lost. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (108 units) is scheduled to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (Current Period). However, since arrivals happen AFTER our decision phase, we won't see this stock until the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. The current pipeline (in-transit) is 509 units (108+107+137+157), which matches the historical orders. There is no evidence of lost shipments yet, as the first order is only just 'due' to arrive this period. Demand seems to have shifted slightly higher than the initial pre-game samples (mean ~100) to a more recent mean of ~120. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this shift in both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since we have no completed arrivals yet, I'll stick with the default (promised) lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Band leggings', a staple 'Everyday Basic'. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 99.6. Following the start of the game, demand fluctuated: P1=92, P2=138, P3=124, P4=128, P5=71. The P1 order arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods (ordered P1, arrived P5), confirming L=4. On-hand inventory is 37 units following the first arrival in P5. Total in-transit is 495 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), which is substantial compared to the current mean demand of ~109.8 (avg P1-P5). Given L=4, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). mu_hat should reflect the recent average demand to avoid over-ordering, as there's a significant pipeline. The dip in P5 (71) might be a fluke or a post-peak stabilization. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the game-time demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics' (leggings), which shows steady demand. Current demand (P1-P6) averages 110.16 units/period, with a notable dip in P5 (71) and recovery in P6 (108). The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in P5 (ordered P1) and P6 (ordered P2). Currently, there is a stockout risk: we have 36 units on-hand, but expected demand is ~100+, and the next delivery (137 units ordered in P3) won't arrive until P7's arrival phase (visible in P8). Since the OR engine's base-stock calculation uses (1+L) periods, setting L to 4 covers 5 periods of demand. I will use the mean of all available historical samples (including the 5 pre-game samples) to define mu_hat. The total sample size is 11 (5 pre-game + 6 game periods). mu_hat = (1+4) * mean(100, 92, 103, 104, 99, 92, 138, 124, 128, 71, 108) = 5 * 105.36 = 526.8. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat as the demand is relatively stable and all samples are relevant. Lead time L is set to 'default' (4).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand for this SKU (Band leggings) has shown some growth, moving from a pre-game average of ~100 to a game-history average of ~114 units per period across the first 7 periods. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7), matching the promised lead time. We have 35 units on-hand and 354 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). The objective is to set parameters where order + pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the slight upward trend in recent weeks (Period 6 demand = 108, Period 7 demand = 138), I will use the recent_N method (N=7) for mu_hat to capture this higher mean (~114) versus the long-term average (~106). Since holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), the optimal service level q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.50, which the OR backend will calculate. This means we are primarily targeting the mean demand across the protection interval.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is activewear leggings, which show consistent demand as we move into spring (April). Recent history shows a significant demand shift: the initial 5 weeks averaged 99.6 units, but the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 4-8) have averaged 128.6 units, peaking at 138 units in the last three consecutive weeks. Because the demand has moved from a mean of ~100 to ~130, I will use a N=5 window for mu_hat to capture this higher regime. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (confirmed by multiple arrivals). sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the current volatility of this higher demand phase. On-hand + In-transit (54 + 353 = 407) is healthy but warrants maintaining the current levels to cover the L+1 window of higher demand (5 periods * ~130 demand/period = 650 units required in the pipeline).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: Mean increased from ~100 to ~130 (+30%) and remained stable at 138 for 3 consecutive weeks (P6-P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is 'Band leggings' (Women's Everyday Basics). Historically, demand shifted at Period 4 from ~100 to ~130. Recent demand (P6-P9) has been 108, 138, 138, and 119, confirming a higher mean. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and all arrivals (P1 through P5 orders) have consistently confirmed an actual lead time of 4 periods (arriving in P5 through P9). Therefore, L=4 is reliable. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio (target service level) of 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand is 29, and pipeline is healthy at 423 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019/4/22). Reviewing the history, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. We experienced a stockout in Period 10 (satisfied 50 of 111 demand) because the arrival in P10 was based on a very small order from P6 (21 units), which was placed during a period where the system was adjusting to high on-hand levels. Demand has stabilized around a higher mean since P4. Over the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the average demand is (108+138+138+119+111)/5 = 122.8. However, looking at the full range since the regime shift in P4, the mean is closer to 125. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 553 units in-transit (Orders from P7 to P10). Expected arrivals in P11 (from P7) are 82 units, which should cover immediate demand, but we need to ensure the pipeline remains full. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (covering the shift from Period 4 onwards) and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the recent volatility. L will be 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU 'Band leggings' has transitioned from a stable early-year demand (~100 units/period) to a higher demand regime (~130 units/period) starting around Period 4. In the last three periods (P9-P11), demand has been 119, 111, and 107 respectively, suggesting a slight cooling from the peak of 138, but still significantly higher than the initial baseline. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 499 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history. Given the high service level requirement (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% critical fractile, but the OR backend's inventory cap logic targets a 95th percentile safety stock based on mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher demand regime while averaging out the recent fluctuations. This covers the demand from P4 to P11. Sigma_hat will also be set based on recent_N=8 to capture recent volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is basic women's leggings, which has shown a demand shift since Period 4. Previously, demand was around 100 units/week; however, the average demand over the last 9 periods (P4-P12) is approximately 120 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory is tight, with stockouts in Periods 10 and 11, though Period 12 ended with 45 units on hand. The current in-transit pipeline is 419 units (Orders from P9, P10, P11, P12). Given the stability of the new demand regime, I will use recent_N to capture the higher mean and variance seen in the last 9 periods. I'll set L to default (4) as the historical arrivals (P5 through P12) consistently show a 4-period lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/13. The product is Women's Everyday Basics leggings. Historical demand analysis shows a shift occurred around Period 4, with average demand increasing to approximately 115-130 units. Recent periods (P9-P13) show demand fluctuating between 98 and 119. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P9 order arrived P13). There are no missing shipments as the P10 order is expected to arrive during the current period (P14), which is consistent with active lead time. On-hand inventory is 111, and pipe-line inventory (P10-P13 orders) is 364 units. Given equal profit and holding costs ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent post-spike stability, and 'default' for lead time as 4 matches the promised value.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-72.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic womens legging. Historically, demand was around 100 but shifted upwards to a peak of 138 around Period 7/8. Since Period 9, demand has stabilized and slightly cooled to an average of ~104 units over the last 6 periods (Periods 9-14: 119, 111, 107, 111, 98, 95). Current on-hand inventory is 167 with 284 in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by the concluded history (P1-P10 arrivals). Given the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, a service level of 50% is targetted by the base stock formula, but the OR engine's cap adds a safety buffer. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging 107) and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Lead time is set to default as the actual lead time mirrors the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-peak (P9-P14): mean decreased from ~130 to ~107 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's basic legging, which typically shows stable demand after early spring peaks. Analyzing recent demand history from Period 9 to Period 15: 119, 111, 107, 111, 98, 95, 82. This confirms the previously noted regime shift where the mean has stabilized around ~103 units, with a slight downward trend over the last 3 weeks (98, 95, 82). I will set N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-peak regime (P9-P15). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. The in-transit inventory (340) plus on-hand (113) totals 453 units, which covers approximately 4.4 periods of demand at the current average rate, aligning well with the (L+1) requirement.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/03. The product is a women's basic jersey legging, which typically exhibits stable demand but can be subject to seasonal shifts. Historical analysis shows a demand regime shift from ~130 units (Periods 4-8) down to ~107 units (Periods 9-14). The most recent two periods (P15 and P16) show demand of 82 and 69 respectively, suggesting a potential further decline or stabilization at a lower level. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (promised = actual). Pipeline inventory (328) plus on-hand (120) equals 448 units. Given L=4, the base stock covers 5 periods of demand. Using the most recent 8 samples (P9-P16) provides a mean demand of ~99 units/period. I will use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining enough sample size to buffer against stockouts, especially since the profit/holding ratio is 1:1, requiring a balanced service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: mean demand for P15-P16 dropped to ~75 units, though N is too small to confirm a new sustained regime yet.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings) is showing a confirmed downward trend in demand as we move into summer (June). Demand has dropped from a peak mean of ~130 to a post-peak average of 107 (P9-P14), and more recently to ~70 based on the last 3 periods (P15: 82, P16: 69, P17: 60). This aligns with a shift away from high-spring basic demand. Lead time remains stable and consistent at 4 periods (P13 order arrived on schedule in P17). With 169 units on-hand and 266 units in-transit (covering orders from P14-P17), the current inventory position is high relative to the cooling demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent decline (average demand ~70). L will stay at the promised 4 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the reduced volatility at these lower volume levels. This approach will signal to the OR backend to significantly reduce orders to avoid compounding holding costs while demand is low.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Demand transitioned from a post-peak average of ~107 to a lower 'summer' regime averaging ~70 (P15-P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (summer). The product is 'Jersey leggings', a basic item that has seen a significant demand decline since early May. Demand history from Period 15 to 18 shows a very clear downward trend: 82, 69, 60, 38, averaging ~62 units. The most recent demand (38) is the lowest recorded, confirming the previously noted 'summer' regime shift. Period 18 ending inventory (on-hand) is 202 units, and in-transit inventory is 195 units (from orders in P15-P17). Given the current mean demand, the pipeline + on-hand inventory already covers approximately 6 periods of supply, which is more than enough for the 4-period lead time. To prevent excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 samples (N=4) to reflect the current mean of ~62. I will use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture the decreased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: P18 demand dropped to 38, extending the downward trend starting P15. Current 4-week average (P15-P18) is ~62 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Band leggings' has entered a significant downward trend as we move into late June (Northern Hemisphere summer). Recent demand figures (P15 to P19) are 82, 69, 60, 38, and 30, showing a steady decrease from the post-peak average. The 5-week average for this new regime (P15-P19) is 55.8 units, significantly lower than the previous period's average of ~107. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 256 units on-hand and 111 in-transit, the current inventory levels are much higher than required for the current demand regime, given the target service level (q = 0.5 when profit = holding cost). I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the current low demand and avoid exacerbating the overstock. Sigma_hat is also updated using recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: P15-P19 average is 55.8 units, down from previous regime of ~107. This reflects a seasonal shift for jersey leggings.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for jersey leggings (608458001) is in a significant seasonal decline as we enter July. Historical demand has dropped sharply over the last six periods: 82, 69, 60, 38, 30, and most recently 16 in Period 20. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 42.6 units, but the most recent two weeks average only 23 units. My Current On-hand (304) + In-transit (47) = 351 units, which covers more than 8 periods of current demand trends. With a profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, making inventory minimization a priority to avoid high holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the low-demand regime, and lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: P20 demand dropped to 16, resulting in a 3-week average (P18-P20) of 28 units, confirming a deep seasonal trough for this SKU.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 608458001 (Jersey leggings) has entered a severe seasonal trough. The demand over the last four periods (P18-P21) has been 38, 30, 16, and 29 units respectively, averaging 28.25 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 322 units, and there are no units in transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need enough inventory to cover the next 5 periods (Review + Lead time). With an estimated demand of ~28 units/week, we need approximately 140 units. Since we have 322 units on hand, we are significantly overstocked. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy; to prevent further ordering while we burn through excess inventory, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent low demand. This will result in a base stock level lower than our current on-hand + in-transit sum, leading to a zero order which is the desired outcome to minimize holding costs while the inventory levels normalize.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-258.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Jersey leggings) is currently in a deep seasonal trough during the summer (July 2019). Demand has collapsed from an average of ~110 units in May to ~26 units in the last three weeks (P20-P22: 16, 29, 32). This confirms the shift noted in Carry-Over Insights. Currently, On-hand inventory is 290 units with 0 In-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods and the review period is 1 (Total L+1 = 5 periods), the expected demand over the next 5 periods at an average of 30 units/week is roughly 150 units. With 290 units on hand, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand and holding costs. Therefore, the OR backend should continue to place 0 orders. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime shift (P18-P22) using recent_N=5 (Avg ~29 units) to ensure the base_stock calculation remains below current inventory levels. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal trough confirmed through Period 22: Average weekly demand for P18-P22 dropped to 29 units, a 73% decrease from May levels (~107 units).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Jersey Leggings) is in a sustained seasonal trough. Current demand from Period 18 to Period 23 averages approximately 28.6 units per week (38, 30, 16, 29, 32, 27). On-hand inventory is 263 units, which provides roughly 9 weeks of cover at the current demand rate. There is no pipeline inventory as no orders have been placed since Period 17. Given that the promised lead time is 4 periods, and the total system inventory (on-hand + pipeline) far exceeds the demand expected over the next (L+1) periods (approx. 5 * 28.6 = 143 units), the OR backend will naturally order 0 units even without aggressive tuning. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (capturing the P18-P23 trough) to provide the most accurate demand forecast and volatility estimate to the OR logic. Using a 1:1 Profit/Holding cost ratio, the backend aims for a 50% service level, further incentivizing the reduction of current excess inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Jersey leggings) is currently in a sustained seasonal trough. Current demand from the last five periods (P20-P24) has been 16, 29, 32, 27, and 12, averaging approximately 23.2 units per week. This level is significantly lower than the previous regimes (~100-130 units). On-hand inventory is 251 units with zero in-transit, which at current demand levels covers over 10 weeks of inventory\u2014far exceeding the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 weeks). Given the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), minimizing excess stock is critical. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period observations. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent seasonal trough (avg ~23 units), and similar for sigma_hat to reflect current lower volatility. The OR engine will likely order 0 units given the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal trough confirmed P20-P24: Average weekly demand fell further to ~23 units, down from ~29 units in the previous 5-week window.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th (Period 26). The SKU (jersey leggings) is in a deep seasonal trough, typical for mid-summer. Demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 23.6 units (29, 32, 27, 12, 18). Current on-hand inventory is 233 units with zero in-transit, providing enough stock for approximately 10 weeks at current demand levels. Since the cost of holding inventory equals the profit per unit (1.0 each), and the lead time is 4 periods, we must set conservative parameters to prevent further accumulation while waiting for the seasonal trough to end or turn. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on history. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stagnant demand regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Jersey leggings) is currently in a deep seasonal trough, as identified in previous periods. The current date is August 12, 2019. Over the last seven periods (P20-P26), demand has been consistently low: 16, 29, 32, 27, 12, 18, 17, resulting in an average of approximately 21.6 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 216 units with zero in-transit, which covers roughly 10 weeks of current demand\u2014far exceeding the (L+1) requirement of 5 weeks. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to the profit ($1.0), and the fact that we are substantially overstocked for the current low-demand regime, I am setting parameters to prevent any new orders. I will use a conservative mu_hat based on the most recent 7-period demand regime to reflect the current seasonal lows accurately.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The SKU (Jersey leggings) is currently in a deep seasonal trough. Demand has been consistently low for the past 10 periods (P18-P27), with the last 5 periods (P23-P27) averaging only 16.8 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 206 units, while the pipeline is empty. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current average of ~17 units/week, the required inventory is approximately 85 units. Since on-hand inventory (206) significantly exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this low-demand regime and use default settings for L and sigma_hat. The high on-hand inventory will continue to incur holding costs, but since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the OR backend's inventory balancing will naturally prevent further ordering until stock levels drop significantly.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal trough (P23-P27): Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 16.8 units per week, down from ~23 units in the previous window.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jersey leggings' is currently in a sustained seasonal trough. Since Period 23, weekly demand has stabilized at a low level, averaging 17.2 units (P23-P28). The current on-hand inventory is 177 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current average demand of ~17 units per week, 5 periods would require ~85 units. Since on-hand inventory (177) significantly exceeds this requirement and the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0/unit), the optimal strategy is to avoid ordering and allow inventory to deplete through natural sales. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the current low-demand regime (P23-P28), which will result in a base stock lower than our current inventory, effectively placing a zero order.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. The SKU (Jersey leggings) is currently in a sustained seasonal trough that began in mid-June. Demand over the last 7 periods (P23-P29) has been remarkably stable, with an average of 18.7 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 159 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents roughly 8.5 weeks of supply. Given the lead time (L=4) and review period (1), we need enough inventory to cover 5 periods (L+1), which equates to approximately 94 units. Since on-hand inventory (159) significantly exceeds this requirement and there are no units in transit, the OR engine will correctly calculate a zero order. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized low-demand regime, ensuring the base stock calculation remains grounded in current seasonal realities without being skewed by the much higher demand seen in Spring.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained seasonal trough, with demand for the last 8 periods (P23-P30) averaging 18.5 units per week. The current date (Sept 9) suggests we are nearing the end of summer, and while leggings may see a seasonal uptick in autumn, there is no evidence of this yet in the demand data. The inventory on-hand (135 units) is significantly higher than the projected demand over the lead time (L=4, so L+1=5 periods). With a weekly mean of ~18-20 units, 5 weeks of demand would be approximately 90-100 units. Since 135 units are already on hand and the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0/unit), the optimal strategy is to allow the existing inventory to deplete further before placing new orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (N=8) to reflect the current low demand, which will result in a base stock lower than the current on-hand inventory, effectively instructing the backend to order 0 units.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal trough (P23-P30): Demand remains stable at a low level, averaging 18.5 units per week.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jersey leggings' is in a sustained seasonal trough. Current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has been consistently low for the last 9 periods (P23-P31), averaging 19.3 units per week. Although autumn usually signals a return to basics like leggings, there is no evidence of a demand uptick in the historical data yet (P31 demand was 20). On-hand inventory is currently 115 units, which covers approximately 6 weeks of demand at the current rate (115 / 19.3 \u2248 5.9). Since L=4, the pipeline + on-hand needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods. Our current 115 units already exceed the requirements for the next 5 periods (approx 96 units). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed stable lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the statistics of the current seasonal trough (P23-P31), ensuring the OR backend has the most accurate view of current low demand to avoid over-ordering as seasonality potentially shifts later.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Band leggings' (608458001) has been in a sustained seasonal trough since mid-June (Period 19). For the last 10 periods (P23-P32), weekly demand has consistently hovered between 9 and 32 units, with an average of approximately 18.2 units. The most recent demand (Period 32) was 9 units. On-hand inventory is currently at 106 units, which at the current average demand rate of ~18 units per week, provides nearly 6 weeks of coverage. Since the lead time is 4 periods and the current inventory exceeds the needs for the review period plus lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), there is no immediate need to order units. I will maintain the 'recent_N' method for demand parameters to stay responsive to any early signs of a seasonal uptick as we move deeper into autumn, setting N=10 to capture the full stability of the current trough while smoothing out the minor weekly fluctuations.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The product is 'Jersey leggings with wide elastication', which typically sees higher demand in cooler months. Historical demand shows a sustained seasonal trough that began in Period 23 (early August), with weekly demand averaging 18.2 units over the last 11 weeks (P23-P33). However, the most recent week (P33) shows 19 units, and as we move into October, a seasonal uptick is anticipated. On-hand inventory is 87 units, which covers approximately 4.7 weeks of the recent average demand. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a service level logic where holding cost equals profit (q=0.5), we want to maintain roughly (L+1) = 5 weeks of stock. Current stock (87) is slightly below the required safety stock if demand increases to ~20-25 units. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mean and sigma to capture the low-demand trough while being sensitive to the current stabilization, allowing the OR engine to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-week horizon without over-ordering before the seasonal rebound is more pronounced.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Jersey leggings) is currently at the end of its seasonal trough. Historical demand since Period 23 has been very stable, averaging approximately 18-19 units per week. Recent demand (P32-P34) shows a slight dip (9, 19, 17) but remains within the established low-demand regime. Current on-hand inventory is 70 units, which covers approximately 4 weeks of demand at the current rate (~17.5 units/week). With a lead time of 4 periods, total coverage needed (L+1) is 5 periods of demand (~87.5 units). I will continue to use recent_N (N=12) to capture the stable trough mean and variance. This strategy maintains a lean inventory while holding enough to meet the current demand regime without incurring excessive holding costs, especially since the profit/holding ratio is 1:1.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Historical demand for this SKU (Jersey leggings) shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high-demand period in Spring/Early Summer (P1-P14, avg ~110-130), followed by a significant decline into a 'summer trough' (P18-P35, avg ~18-20). The last 5 periods (P31-P35) have shown demands of 20, 9, 19, 17, and 7, averaging 14.4 units per week. While the trough appears stable, we must be alert for a potential late Autumn/Winter uptick common in basic apparel, though no evidence of a rise is present yet. On-hand inventory is 63, plus 22 in-transit. With current demand levels (~15/week), the existing inventory (85 total) covers nearly 6 periods, which is more than the L+1 window. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods whenever orders were placed. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the lowest part of the seasonal trough and default for sigma to maintain a safety buffer against any sudden seasonal recovery.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal trough (P31-P35): Demand has further weakened, averaging 14.4 units per week, compared to the previous ~18.5 unit average.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. The SKU is 'Jersey leggings', which typically sees a demand increase as colder weather approaches in late October/November. Historical demand has been in a sustained seasonal trough since June (Period 18), recently averaging ~14.4 units per week (P31-P35). However, P36 demand was 15 units, potentially signaling the start of a stabilizing or upward trend. On-hand inventory is 48 units with 22 units in-transit (ordered P34 and P35). Since lead time is 4 periods, the P34 order (1 unit) is expected in P38 and the P35 order (21 units) in P39. Total pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) is 70 units. Given the transition into late autumn, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 (covering P31-P36) to capture the current trough while remaining sensitive to the potential seasonal uptick. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to reflect current low volatility. L remains calculated based on the consistent 4-period historical performance.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The SKU (Jersey leggings) has been in a sustained seasonal trough since mid-summer. Demand for the most recent 10-week period (P28-P37) has averaged approximately 16.8 units per week. Although leggings often see a sales lift in late autumn/winter, current demand remains stable at this low level (P37 demand was 10). On-hand inventory is 38 and in-transit is 25 (total 63), which covers nearly 4 weeks of demand at the current rate. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since the inventory position is adequate for the current low-demand regime and we are focusing on minimizing holding costs while demand remains historically low, I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 weeks of data to capture the current stable trough, and sigma_hat similarly to reflect current low volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Jersey leggings) is currently in a deep seasonal trough, as identified in the carry-over insights and confirmed by recent demand (P34-P38: 17, 7, 15, 10, 6). The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P34 order arrived in P38). With on-hand inventory at 33 and 45 units in transit, the current pipeline coverage is well above the current weekly requirements of ~10-14 units. However, as we approach November (P39), we must monitor for a potential late-autumn or winter uptick in demand for 'Everyday Basics' like leggings. Currently, the mean demand over the last 5 periods is 11 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current low-demand stability accurately while the backend's default logic maintains a safe buffer. This prevents over-ordering while the stock level gradually depletes toward the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal trough continues through Period 38: Demand for the last 5 periods (P34-P38) averaged 11.0 units per week, showing further weakening from the P31-P35 average of 14.4.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The SKU 'Band leggings' is in a deep seasonal trough that has persisted since June. Recent demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) has been exceptionally low, averaging 8.4 units per week (7, 15, 10, 6, 4). This confirms the 'seasonal trough' insight recorded previously. Inventory is currently sufficient: with an on-hand balance of 50 and 24 units in transit (expected to arrive in P41 and P42), the total pipeline of 74 units easily covers several weeks of demand at the current rate (~8.4/week). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the goal is to minimize excess stock while maintaining a moderate service level. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand weakening (avg 8.4) and avoid over-ordering during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Deep seasonal trough sustained (P35-P39): Average weekly demand dropped further to 8.4 units, compared to the previous 5-period average of 11.0 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Jersey leggings) is currently at its deepest seasonal trough. Demand has progressively weakened from 11.0 units (P34-P38) to 8.4 units per week (P35-P39), with the most recent demand being only 3 units in Period 40. We are moving into mid-November, and while retail often spikes for holidays, this specific basic jersey legging SKU has shown no such signal yet; instead, it is exhibiting extremely low, single-digit demand. Current on-hand inventory is 47 units with 24 units in-transit (ordered P37 and P38), totaling 71 units of pipeline inventory. Given the current 5-period average (P36-P40) of 7.6 units, 71 units covers nearly 10 weeks of demand. We will use recent_N=5 to capture this deep trough while maintaining a small buffer for any potential late-November recovery. The OR backend will likely suppress ordering given the high on-hand relative to this low demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Deep seasonal trough sustained (P36-P40): Average weekly demand dropped further to 7.6 units, down from the previous 5-period average of 8.4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-42.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey leggings' remains in a deep seasonal trough as we approach late November. The most recent demand samples from P37-P41 are 10, 6, 4, 3, and 4 units, respectively. The 5-period average (P37-P41) is now 5.4 units per week, continuing the downward trend noted in previous periods. On-hand inventory is 46 units, and 21 units are in-transit (ordered P38, expected arrival Period 42 conclude/visible P43). Given the current holding cost equals the profit margin ($1.00 each), and the current inventory levels (46 + 21 = 67 units) cover over 12 weeks of current demand (67 / 5.4 \u2248 12.4), additional ordering should be minimized to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this sustained low-demand regime. This will result in a low base stock, effectively pausing new orders until the existing surplus is cleared or demand recovers.

Carry-over insight: Deep seasonal trough sustained (P37-P41): Average weekly demand dropped further to 5.4 units, down from the previous 5-period average of 7.6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observation for Period 42 (69 units) represents a significant and sharp departure from the deep seasonal trough (which averaged ~5-8 units). This spike coincides with late November (Black Friday/Cyber Monday week), a major retail event. Given that Jersey Leggings are 'Everyday Basics', they are highly susceptible to promotional spikes. With current on-hand inventory at 0 and no units in-transit, there is an immediate risk of stockouts during this potential 'recovery' or 'holiday peak' phase. I will shift the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this new regime by using a recent window that captures the spike, while acknowledging that lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value based on the Period 42 spike to ensure the OR backend generates a substantial order to refill the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 42 (69 units), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday seasonal promotions, ending the deep seasonal trough observed since Period 35.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant demand spike corresponding with the Black Friday/Cyber Monday period (Period 42: 69 units; Period 43: 76 units). These values are dramatically higher than the deep seasonal trough of ~5-8 units observed in Periods 35-41. With On-hand currently at 0 and 106 units in transit (expected to arrive in Period 47 based on the confirmed 4-period lead time), we are in a stockout situation. To capture the remaining holiday demand and ensure the OR backend reacts to this new 'peak' regime, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 350. This represents a forecast of 70 units per week across the current period plus lead time (1+4=5 periods), matching the recent spike. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the high volatility introduced by this abrupt trend shift.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42-43 demand averaged 72.5 units, ending the seasonal trough that averaged <10 units. Forecast for next 4-5 weeks should reflect this elevated level.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday period (P45, Dec 16). Historical demand for this SKU (jersey leggings) showed a significant spike in late November/early December (P42: 69 units, P43: 76 units), which matches Black Friday/Cyber Monday and early holiday shopping. However, demand dropped sharply in P44 to 7 units. This volatility is typical for basic items during holiday shifts. My goal is to maintain stock for potential post-holiday demand while managing the high holding cost ($1.0/unit). On-hand inventory is 0 due to the recent spike. Pipeline inventory is 242 units (Orders from P43: 106, P44: 136), with the P43 order expected to arrive in P47. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and the end of the peak spike, I am using a recent N of 3 for mu_hat (P42-P44) which captures the spike but averages it with the recent drop, resulting in a mean of ~50.6 units. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5), covering approximately 250 units in the pipeline/on-hand. This aligns well with our current in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peaked P42-P43 (avg 72.5) and showed a significant drop in P44 (7 units), indicating the primary promotional spike has passed but higher-than-trough volatility remains.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-holiday period for Jersey leggings (Product 608458001). Historical demand patterns show a significant spike during Black Friday/Cyber Monday (Periods 42-43: avg 72.5), followed by extreme volatility and stockouts (Periods 44-45). With the current date being Dec 23, we expect demand to potentially pick up slightly for post-holiday sales or gift cards, but remain lower than the peak. Crucially, the system is currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and is waiting for orders placed in Period 43 (106 units) and Period 44 (136 units) to arrive in Period 47 and Period 48 respectively, based on the confirmed 4-period lead time. Since the OR backend uses a capped policy that factors in pipeline inventory (currently 254 units), and the recent demand has been highly erratic (76, 7, 36), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the holiday regime (avg ~47 units/period) for mu_hat. This provides a base_stock target that accounts for the high-demand volatility while the pipeline catches up. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to ensure the OR engine recognizes the high variability (standard deviation) caused by the spike-and-drop pattern, thereby maintaining a sufficient service level buffer.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday volatility confirmed (Period 44-45): Demand fluctuated from 7 to 36 units after the peak of 76, following a deep trough. The 4-week moving average (P42-P45) is 47 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 (late December), moving past the major holiday season. History shows a huge demand spike in P42-43 (avg 72.5) followed by extreme volatility (7 to 36 units). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 254 units in-transit. The order from P43 (106 units) is expected to arrive this period (P47), based on the confirmed lead time of 4. Since the extreme promotional peaks of late November/early December are over but demand remains higher than the deep summer trough (<10 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (P42-P46) to capture the elevated post-holiday volatility and residual seasonal interest in leggings. This 'recent_N' approach (N=5) averages the 72.5 peak and the more recent 7-36 unit range, providing a robust buffer for the current transition. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition (P44-P46): Following the P42-43 spike, demand has settled into a volatile but higher-than-trough range (7-36 units), necessitating higher safety stocks than the autumn period.
