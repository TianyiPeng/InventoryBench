Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Nora T-shirt'. Initial inventory is 0. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 0, 0, 11, 17, 38. This product follows a typical early-season ramp-up for a basic women's t-shirt. The immediate priority is to establish a base stock that covers the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current demand has accelerated to 38 units in the most recent week. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent growth (averaging 11, 17, 38) and 'default' for sigma_hat. Since there are no observed arrivals yet, 'L' will remain at default (the promised 4 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the history, this 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) is seeing a clear ramp-up in demand: 11, 17, 38, and most recently 54. The mean of the last 3 samples is (17+38+54)/3 = 36.33. The promised lead time (L) is 4. In Period 1, we ordered 48 units which are now 'In-transit'. However, on-hand inventory is 0 and we lost all 54 sales in Period 1 due to a stockout. With a lead time of 4, the order placed in P1 will arrive at P5 conclude (visible P6). To bridge this gap and account for the upward trend (regime shift), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent growth rather than the zeros from Jan 7/14. For L, I will use 'default' (promised L=4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting late Jan/early Feb: demand increased from low single digits to 54 units (+300% over 4 weeks).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing a sharp upward demand trend as it enters the spring season, increasing from 54 units in Period 1 to 100 units in Period 2. Currently, there is an inventory stockout (On-hand: 0) because the first order placed in Period 1 (with a promised lead time of 4) is not expected to arrive until Period 5. Total in-transit inventory is 115 units (48 from P1, 67 from P2). I need to set parameters to cover the demand over the 4-period lead time plus the review period (Total 5 periods). Given the rapid growth, I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture the current high-demand regime (Avg: 77) rather than the long-term history which includes zero demand. Setting mu_hat using N=2 will calculate 5 * 77 = 385 units, and sigma_hat with N=2 will provide a volatility estimate based on the recent jump.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed: Demand rose from 54 to 100 units in 2 weeks (+85%), signaling strong seasonal growth for basic jersey T-shirts in Feb/March.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 4 (2019-03-04), we are managing a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. The demand has shifted from near-zero to a sustained high: 54, 100, and 113 in the last three weeks. This confirms a significant upward regime shift as we enter the spring season. Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand), and we have 246 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4. Given that we are in Period 4, our Period 1 order (placed 2019-02-11) is expected to arrive during Period 5 arrival resolution; we should see confirmation in the Period 6 start message. To address the higher demand, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (averaging ~89 units/period) rather than the zero-demand periods from early January. I will maintain the default promised lead time of 4 until we have empirical arrival data to calculate an actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime (Period 1-3): mean approx 89 units/period. Significant growth from Feb baseline.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is a women's jersey basic T-shirt, which is seeing a significant seasonal demand increase as we move into spring. Historical demand since late January has risen from 11/17 units to a recent plateau around 88-113 units (average ~100 over the last 3 periods). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand = 0) because orders from Periods 1-4 have not arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (48 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (4 periods later), which will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Pipeline inventory is currently 386 units (48+67+131+140), which covers the upcoming 4 periods of demand if the mean is ~100. However, because demand spiked significantly compared to the pre-Feb period, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the 88-113 range, which yields a mean of ~100.3. This results in a mu_hat of approx 501.5 (1+4 * 100.3). I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the higher demand regime while we wait for the pipeline to start arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued in the 88-113 range over the last 3 periods (avg ~100); seasonal growth appears to be stabilizing at this higher level for early Spring.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/3/18), we have confirmed that the product (Nora T-shirt, a basic jersey tee) has a lead time of 4 periods. The Period 1 order arrived as scheduled in Period 5. Demand has transitioned from early spring growth (~100 units/period) to a slightly lower 56 units in the most recent period. However, given the product type and spring date, we should anticipate continued baseline demand. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) because the first shipment was fully consumed. We have 459 units in transit across four pending orders. To maintain service levels, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher volume regime (approx 89 units/period) rather than the lifetime average, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) exposure period (5 periods). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as we now have an observed lead time of 4, validating the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 5). On-hand inventory currently zero as initial shipments are consumed by high demand (~90 units/period).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. We are seeing sustained demand for the Womens Everyday Basics Nora T-shirt. Demand over the last 6 periods averages 80.3 units, but the last 3-4 periods show a stable range around 70-110 units (avg ~82 since the initial spike). Lead time is now confirmed at 4 periods based on two consecutive arrivals (Period 1 and Period 2 orders arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because demand (71) exceeded the arriving quantity (67). Historical data shows demand was 0-17 in Jan, shot up to 100+ in Feb, and is currently averaging ~70-90 in March. For Period 7 (L=4), we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). mu_hat should reflect the current stabilization; recent_N=4 covers the Feb peak and March stabilization (avg ~82). sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to capture the volatility from the initial ramp-up until now, ensuring a safety buffer for this 'Everyday Basic' item.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), we are in the peak spring season for a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt'. Historically, demand has stabilized around a mean of ~89-90 units over the last 7 periods (sum 596 / 7 = 85.1, but looking at the last 5 periods: 100, 113, 88, 56, 71, 114, the average is ~88.6). The actual lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, and 7 conclusions). Pipeline inventory is healthy (325 in-transit) with 140 units expected to arrive in Period 8 (ordered P4, visible P9). We currently have 17 units on-hand. Since demand is relatively stable but we are moving into April (Spring season), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most recent stability (avg ~88) and 'default' for lead time since the 4-period promise is holding. This allows the OR backend to maintain a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (1+4=5 periods total).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are in the peak spring season for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt. Historical data from the last 5 periods (Periods 4-8) shows a stable demand regime with a mean of 95.2 units and a standard deviation of approximately 23.9 units. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the arrivals of orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4). We currently have 50 units on-hand and 316 units in-transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). The total pipeline plus on-hand (366) covers nearly 4 periods of demand at the current average. To ensure we maintain a high service level through April while demand remains steady, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current plateau. Lead time (L) remains at the reliable default of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (Periods 4-8): mean ~95 units/period, SD ~24. Consistency across late March and early April suggests the growth phase has plateaued for the current spring season.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a staple 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt. We have seen consistent demand growth through Feb/March, which has stabilized at a higher level in April. Looking at the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10), demand has been 71, 114, 107, 122, and 133, averaging ~109 units per period. The recent Period 10 demand of 133 suggests a slight upward trend as we move further into Spring. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 10's arrival of the Period 6 order). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the high demand in Period 10 exceeding the starting inventory plus the small arrival from Period 6. There are 320 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Since demand has shown a sustained higher level and recent volatility, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observed lead times have been consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 7: Average demand increased to ~110 units/period (from ~90 in earlier periods), likely due to full Spring seasonality for basic jersey T-shirts.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019, entering the peak search and demand period for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (soft jersey T-shirts) as spring transitions to summer. Demand has surged significantly in the last two periods (133 and 164), exceeding the previous regime average of ~110. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, despite a lead time of 4 periods being consistently confirmed (Period 7 order arrived in Period 11). The system is currently underperforming on fulfillment due to a sharp demand increase. I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this late-April surge (avg ~140). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility (Standard Deviation ~24) seen since early April. L remains at the default/promised 4 periods as evidence remains consistent with that value.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed late April: Week 10-11 averaged 148 units/period, a ~35% increase over the early April regime (~110). This aligns with peak seasonal shift for jersey basics.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is a jersey basic T-shirt, which is in peak demand during late Spring/early Summer. Demand has surged significantly over the last three periods (P10: 133, P11: 164, P12: 150), averaging ~149 units/period. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 485 units in transit. Specifically, an order of 116 units (placed P9) is expected to arrive this period (P13 resolution), and 43 units (placed P10) the next. Given the current demand regime is roughly 150 units/week and L=4, the pipeline needs to support demand for (L+1) = 5 periods (~750 units). Since on-hand + in-transit is 485, the OR backend will need to order approximately 265 units unless capped. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture this latest surge, and 'calculate' for Lead Time as it has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed for peak Spring (starting P10): average demand increased to ~150 units/period (up from ~110 in the previous regime, a ~36% increase).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/05/13). The product is a Nora T-shirt (Women's Jersey Basic), which is a spring/summer core item. Demand history shows a climb from ~90 to ~150 units per period as the season progressed. Although Period 13 saw a slight dip to 118, the average of the last 4 periods (P10-P13) is 141.25, and P10-P12 averaged ~149. The 'conclude' messages confirm the lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are entering the peak summer season, I will use a 4-period lookback (N=4) for demand to reflect this ~140-150 unit regime, ensuring we capture the recent peak while slightly tempering the P13 outlier. For lead time (L), the evidence consistently shows 4 periods, so 'default' or 'calculate' is appropriate. I will use 'calculate' to incorporate all observed lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing the 'Nora T-shirt', a womens basic jersey t-shirt. Current date is May 20th. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been volatile, ranging from 118 to 164 over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), with an average around 137. The peak observed was 164 in P11, followed by a slight cooling to 118-122 in the last two periods. This may indicate the absolute spring peak has passed, but demand remains high compared to earlier months. Inventory/LT Analysis: The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Orders from P1-P10 have all arrived exactly at P+4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has consistently outpaced small orders placed during the build-up phase (P10 order of 43 was very low relative to demand). Pipeline inventory is high (676 units). Parameter Selection: Because demand shifted significantly around P10, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (Avg ~137). Lead time (L) remains solid at 4, so I will use 'calculate' to reflect the highly consistent historical arrival pattern.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late May (2019/5/27), and the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt'. Historically, demand stabilized around ~150 units/period starting in Period 10 (peak Spring), though there was a slight dip to 122 in Period 14 followed by a return to 153 in Period 15. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is 140 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because arrivals (149 from P11) were fully consumed by demand (153). Pipeline inventory is 575 units, comprising orders from Period 12 (177), Period 13 (175), Period 14 (175), and Period 15 (48). The large orders from P12-P14 are expected to arrive in Periods 16, 17, and 18 respectively. To set the OR parameters, I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this peak Spring regime (avg ~140, std ~17). L is set to 'default' (4) as arrivals have been perfectly on time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand for this jersey T-shirt shows a clear seasonal progression: from ~90 units/period in early Spring (Period 4-9) to ~150 units/period in late Spring (since Period 10). The most recent 5 periods (P12-P16) have seen demand of 150, 118, 122, 153, and 147, averaging 138 units. While there was a slight dip in Periods 13 and 14, the last two periods (P15-16) returned to the ~150 level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 30 units on-hand and high demand, we must rely on the large pipeline (558 units) which includes significant orders from P13 (175 units), P14 (175 units), P15 (48 units), and P16 (160 units). I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand mu_hat to capture the shift to over 130+ units while smoothing out the minor dips, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the peak Spring/early Summer demand regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product (Nora T-shirt) is a basic jersey staple for women. We have entered a high-demand regime for the peak spring/early summer season. Over the last 8 periods (Period 10 to 17), demand has stabilized at an average of 138.75 units per period (133, 164, 150, 118, 122, 153, 147, 123), following a peak in late April. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (arrived-ordered: 5-1, 6-2... 17-13). I am using a recent_N of 8 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent sustained regime. With on-hand inventory at 82 and 533 units in transit (matching orders from P14-P17), the pipeline is well-stocked. The L=4 parameter with mu_hat based on the last 8 weeks (~139 units/period) will ensure the base stock levels are maintained for the 5-period window (L+1) required to cover future demand without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: In June 2019, demand for jersey basics has stabilized at a high-summer regime averaging ~139 units/period (Periods 10-17) after the initial spring surge.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product (Nora T-shirt, Womens Everyday Basics) has been in a high-summer demand regime since mid-April. In the most recent period (P18), demand dropped to 82 units, significantly lower than the P10-P17 average of ~139. However, looking at the full history, demand often fluctuates (e.g., P13: 118, P17: 123), and a single low data point doesn't yet confirm a downward regime shift as the weather remains warm. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (P14 order arrived P18). Current on-hand inventory is 175, and in-transit is 469 (orders from P15-P18). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 644. Based on the 8-period regime (P10-P17) mean of ~139, 5 periods of demand (L+1) equals ~695 units. Given the recent variability and the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I will use the last 9 samples (P10-P18) to set mu_hat, which incorporates the recent dip and the preceding high levels. N=9 captures the entire current high-season phase. Sigma_hat will also be based on these 9 samples to reflect the increased volatility seen in the last two periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a Nora T-shirt (Jersey Basic), which is in its high-summer demand regime. Since Period 10, the demand has averaged approximately 130-140 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 19) was 127 units. The Lead Time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals from Periods 1-15). The pipeline inventory (486) + on-hand (96) = 582 units. With L=4, the base stock system covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). My current regime mean is ~135 units/period. 5 * 135 = 675. The system currently sits slightly below this safety level. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the high-summer mean (approx 132 units/period in the last 10 samples) and sigma_hat to account for recent volatility (~23 units). Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. The product is a staple women's jersey T-shirt, which is in peak demand during the summer months. Recent demand history shows a stable high-summer regime: over the last 10 periods (P11-P20), demand has averaged approximately 133 units with a standard deviation of 22. In the most recent 3 periods (P18-P20), demand was 82, 127, and 144 (avg 117.6), showing some volatility but remaining within the expected range for the season. Demand typically remains strong through July. Inventory levels are currently healthy with 112 units on-hand and 448 units in-transit (reflecting the 4-period lead time). The Lead Time (L) remains consistently 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P16 order arrived in P20). I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable summer regime that began with the Spring surge, providing a robust balance between recent trends and seasonal stability.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (July 8, 2019), we are managing a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical lead times have consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-21). Demand for this item stabilized into a summer regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 130-140 units. Specifically, looking at the last 11 periods (P11-P21), the mean demand is 131 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 23. This stability justifies using recent history (recent_N) over the full history, which includes the early-year ramp-up. We currently have 149 units on-hand and 448 in-transit. The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the next (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using N=11 periods captures the entire summer regime established after the spring peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a soft jersey basic T-shirt. Historically, demand peaked in peak Spring (P10-P16) around 150 units/period. Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has softened to an average of 110 units/period (82, 127, 144, 113, 84), likely reflecting a transition from peak summer demand towards late summer. This mid-summer regime is lower than the Spring peak but remains significant. I will set N=7 to capture the demand shift observed since June (including the end of the peak and the subsequent softening). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 176 and in-transit is 440 (total pipeline 616), which covers approximately 5.6 periods of current demand (~110), slightly above the target (L+1=5). Using recent_N for mu_hat captures this current softening to avoid overstocking as the season progresses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening in late June/July: Average demand decreased from ~145 to ~110 units/period (P18-P22) compared to the peak Spring regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598038 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is entering late July (Period 24, 2019/07/22). History shows a demand softening since Period 18, with the last 6 periods averaging ~111.5 units compared to the peak spring average of ~150. Specifically, lead-time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 124 units, and the pipeline is 394 units. Given the transition from peak summer into late summer, demand typically stabilizes or continues a slight downward trend for basic jersey products. I am setting L to default (4) as observed lead times are consistently 4. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the current post-peak demand regime (~111/period), and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture recent volatility (Std Dev ~25), ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for high-margin basics (Profit 4, Holding 1) while accounting for the recent volume decrease.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598038 (Nora T-shirt) is currently in a post-peak summer regime. Demand analysis shows a clear softening from the peak spring/early summer average (~139-150 units) to a more moderate level. Over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand has averaged 112.8 units (144, 113, 84, 117, 106). Lead time remains stable and consistent at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 140 and a substantial pipeline of 356 units (orders from P21-P24), we are well-covered. To avoid overstocking during this downward trend in late July/August, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect the current 113 units/period demand regime. This will allow the OR backend to normalize order quantities and reduce trailing inventory as seasonality potentially wanes further.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening stabilized: Periods 20-24 average ~113 units/period, down ~20% from the peak Spring/Summer average of ~140-150.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). Demand has stabilized into a late-summer regime following the peak spring/early summer surge. Over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), demand has averaged 111.3 units (range: 84-144). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 186 and in-transit at 315, total pipeline is 501 units, which covers approximately 4.5 periods of the current demand regime. As we approach late summer, demand for basic jersey T-shirts typically remains steady before potential school-season shifts. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring we don't over-order based on the earlier peak spring levels while maintaining sufficient stock for the 4-period lead time.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical demand for this Nora T-shirt (Jersey Basic) shows a clear shift. After peaking in spring (approx. 150/period), demand has softened as we entered late summer (August). Over the last 7 periods (P20-P26), demand has averaged 104.4 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 19 units. This reinforces the 'softening' regime noted in previous carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to align \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with this most recent demand regime (N=7) to avoid over-ordering as the summer season concludes. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period lead-time-plus-review window (L+1), adjusted for the profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late summer (August) stabilized at approx 104 units/period (Periods 20-26), confirmed as a ~30% decrease from peak Spring/early Summer levels.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/19. Historical demand for this jersey T-shirt shows a clear stabilizing trend in August (late summer) at a lower level than peak spring/early summer. The average demand for the most recent period (P20-P27) is approximately 102.5 units/period, significantly lower than the ~140-150 range observed in May/June. Period 27 demand was 69, continuing the lower-demand trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P23 order arrived in P27). Inventory position is healthy with 156 on-hand and 351 in-transit. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stabilize late-summer demand regime (approx 103 units/period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This N covers the period since late June when demand began softening, providing a more relevant forecast for the current transition into late August/September than a full-history average.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand regime (August) confirmed: Average demand for P20-P27 is ~103 units/period, representing a sustained ~30% decrease from the peak spring/early summer average of ~145.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26). Demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' has clearly entered a late-summer/early-autumn softening phase. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P20-P28), demand has averaged approximately 99 units per period, but the most recent 3 periods (P26-P28) specifically show a further dip to an average of 75.7 units. This downward trend is expected as the peak summer season concludes. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 165 units, with a significant pipeline of 317 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and the softening demand, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while maintaining enough buffer for the tail end of summer. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that prevents over-ordering into a potentially stagnant autumn inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late August/early September has further softened: average demand for P26-P28 is ~76 units/period, compared to the ~103 average in early August (P20-P27).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Demand for this jersey basic T-shirt has entered a sustained low-season/autumn decline. Looking at the last four periods (P26-P29), demand was 83, 69, 75, and 64, averaging ~73 units/period. This is a significant drop from the early August average of ~103. I will transition the demand forecast to a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to capture this new, lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P25 order. With an on-hand inventory of 210 and in-transit of 269 (total 479), and an expected demand of ~73/period, the current pipeline covers over 6 periods of demand (5 * 73 = 365). The OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a small or zero order this period to bleed off the excess inventory accumulated during the demand drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for September/Autumn established: Average demand for P26-P29 is ~73 units/period, down ~30% from the August regime (103) and ~50% from the Spring/Summer peak (145).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Nora T-shirt' (a jersey basic) is continuing its seasonal cooling as we move into September. The average demand for the last four periods (P27-P30) is 65.25 units, showing a steady decline from the August average of ~100 and the Spring peak of ~145. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 250 units, which is approximately four periods of current demand. In-transit inventory includes orders from P27 (65), P28 (50), and P29 (61), totaling 176 units. Given the high stock level (426 total pipeline units against a demand forecast of ~65/period), the policy should aim to burn off existing inventory to minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this autumnal regime and keep L at the promised 4 periods, as arrivals have been consistently on time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for September/Autumn cooling further: average demand for P27-P30 is ~65 units/period, down from the early-August regime of ~103.

This pipeline is substantially higher than the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), which I estimate to be around 250-300 units given the current trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P27 order arrived P31). To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining market, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the cooling demand regime, which will result in a lower base stock and likely zero additional orders until inventory rebalances.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for September/Autumn established: Average demand for P28-P31 is 57 units/period, confirming a further ~20% drop from the early September regime (~73) and a total ~60% decrease from the Spring/Summer peak (145).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (late September), demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' (jersey basic) continues its sharp seasonal decline as we transition into Autumn. History shows demand has dropped from ~145 units/period in Spring/Summer to an average of ~46 units over the last 4 periods (P29-P32: 64, 53, 37, 29). The most recent observation is 29 units. We currently have 299 units on-hand and 61 units in-transit (ordered P29), totaling 360 units of pipeline inventory. Given the current demand trend, this inventory is sufficient to cover over 10 periods of demand. To avoid excessive holding costs during this cooling phase, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to capture the downward trend and maintain L at the confirmed lead time of 4. No new orders are expected or needed for several cycles.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for mid-late September has entered a sharp seasonal decline: average demand for P29-P32 is ~46 units/period, down from ~73 in early September and ~145 at the summer peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is exhibiting a sharp seasonal decline as we move fully into Autumn. Demand over the last 4 periods (P30-P33) has been 53, 37, 29, and 45 units respectively (average ~41 units/period), compared to ~73 in early September and the Summer peak of ~145. We currently have 315 units on-hand, which at the recent demand rate of ~41 units/period, represents over 7 periods of stock. With a lead time of 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked relative to the falling demand. My objective is to minimize holding costs while the inventory naturally depletes. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 samples (N=4) to reflect this new lower demand regime and keep L at the confirmed value of 4 to prevent unnecessary ordering by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for Autumn stabilized at a low level: average demand for P30-P33 is ~41 units/period, confirming a ~70% total reduction from the Spring/Summer peak (145).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for the Nora T-shirt (a jersey basic) has entered a sharp seasonal decline as we move into Autumn. Recent demand samples (P31-P34: 37, 29, 45, 24) show an average of approximately 34 units/period, consistent with the cooling trend identified in previous periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 291 units with zero in-transit, as previous orders (placed during higher demand regimes) have fully arrived. Given the low demand and 4-week lead time, the current inventory (291 units) is sufficient to cover approximately 8.5 periods of demand at the current rate (34 units/period), well exceeding the (L+1) requirement. To avoid additional holding costs and inventory bloat during this low-demand season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 samples to reflect the current regime, while relying on the existing stock surplus to satisfy demand without triggering new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for October/Mid-Autumn confirmed at approximately 34 units/period (average P31-P34), representing a ~75% reduction from the Spring/Summer peak (~145).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Everyday Basic T-shirt) is in a significant seasonal decline as we move into mid-October. Current demand has dropped from a peak of ~145 units/period in Spring to an average of ~24 units over the last 3 periods (P33-P35: 45, 24, 16). With 275 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we have over 11 weeks of supply at current demand rates. The OR backend needs to be informed of this sharp downward trend to prevent further ordering and minimize holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent decline (avg ~28) while recognizing the trend is still heading lower. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for mid-October has hit a new low: average for P33-P35 is ~28 units/period, continuing the downward trend from the September average of ~41. Supply exceeds immediate needs significantly.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) is in a significant seasonal decline as we move deep into October. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P33-P36) is approximately 25.5 units, which is a ~75% drop from the summer peak. We are currently sitting on an inventory of 258 units with zero in-transit, as ordering was halted in Period 30. Given the current demand rate of ~17-24 units per period, the existing on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 10-15 weeks of demand. To minimize holding costs during this low-demand autumn/winter phase, I will keep mu_hat low and let the OR backend maintain the zero-order policy. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current low-demand regime, and keep L at default since it has consistently been 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late October/early Autumn has reached a floor of approximately 17-20 units/period, down from the September average of ~40. The current stock levels (258 units) are drastically high relative to this new demand baseline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt (Women's Everyday Basics) has entered a sustained low-demand regime as we move into late October, reflecting a strong seasonal shift away from short-sleeved jersey basics. Recent demand (P34-P37) has averaged approximately 21 units per period (24, 16, 17, 27). Current on-hand inventory is 231 units, which at the current demand rate, represents over 10 periods of supply. With no units in-transit and a 4-period lead time, existing stock is more than sufficient to cover anticipated demand for the remainder of the season. To minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while maintaining the required service level ($4 profit), I will continue to set the OR parameters to reflect this low-demand state, effectively keeping new orders at zero until the inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor established for late October (P34-P37): Average demand is ~21 units/period, down from ~40 in September. On-hand inventory represents ~11 weeks of safety stock at this rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-171.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt continues its seasonal descent into late Autumn/early Winter. The demand floor established in Period 38 (~21 units) has softened further, with the most recent sample at 12 units. Current on-hand inventory is 219 units, which, even at a demand rate of 25 units/period, represents over 8 weeks of coverage. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00) and the significant overstock, no new orders should be placed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P35-P38) to reflect the current low-demand regime (avg ~18 units/period). This will keep the OR backend's calculated base stock level far below the current on-hand + pipeline inventory, resulting in a zero order and allowing the system to consume existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor for early November (P35-P38) confirmed at ~18 units/period, continuing the seasonal decline from the October average of ~21.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) is in a significant seasonal decline as we move into mid-November. The demand floor has dropped from ~100 units in August to an average of ~18 units over the last 4 periods (P36-P39). On-hand inventory is currently 207 units, which at the current burn rate represents over 11 weeks of safety stock. There are no units in-transit, which is appropriate given the massive overstock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs ($1/unit/period) while demand is low and potentially still falling, I am maintaining zero orders. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this low-demand 'winter' regime while allowing the system to clear existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor for early November (P36-P39) confirmed at ~17 units/period, a ~60% drop from the September average (~41) and an 88% drop from the summer peak (~145).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). The demand for this jersey basic segment has reached its deep winter trough, confirming a sustained decline from the summer peak. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P37-P40) is approximately 14 units/period, with the most recent sample at 8 units. On-hand inventory is currently 199 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 14-20 periods of future demand, far exceeding the lead time requirements. There is no in-transit inventory, and given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00), minimizing inventory is crucial. I will set the demand parameters using the most recent 4 periods to reflect this low-demand regime and use default lead time, allowing the OR backend to continue suppressing orders until stock levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Mid-November demand floor confirmed: average demand for P37-P40 is ~14 units/period, representing a 90% reduction from summer peak. Inventory levels are extremely high (14+ weeks of cover).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late November (2019/11/25), approaching Period 42. Demand for this jersey T-shirt has hit a seasonal floor, consistent with winter. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is approximately 14.8 units/period. Current on-hand inventory is 184 units, which provides over 12 periods of cover at current demand levels. Since the remaining game length is 6 periods (including the current period) and lead time is 4 periods, there is no risk of stockout before the game ends. The priority remains to liquidate existing stock and avoid any new holding costs from unnecessary orders. I will set the lead time to its promised value and use the recent 5-period demand mean to reflect the current winter trough, though the OR backend will cap orders at 0 due to the high on-hand inventory.

Current on-hand inventory is 166 units, which provides over 10 periods of coverage at this demand rate. With only 5 periods remaining in the game (ending Period 47), no further orders are required. The strategy remains focused on liquidating the existing high inventory to minimize holding costs while meeting the minimal residual demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, and mu/sigma parameters are set using recent samples (N=5) to reflect the current floor, though the order quantity will be capped at zero by the OR backend due to the massive inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: December demand floor for jersey basics confirmed: average demand (P38-P42) is ~13.8 units/period, representing a 90%+ drop from summer peak. High inventory levels (166 units) will carry through to the end of the simulation.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is entering its final stages (Period 44 of 47). Current demand for the womens jersey T-shirt (Nora T-shirt) is at a seasonal winter low, averaging ~13.8 units over the last 5 periods (P39-P43). On-hand inventory is 155 units, which provides over 11 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate\u2014far exceeding the remaining 4 periods of the simulation. Given the 4-period lead time, any order placed now would arrive at the very end of the game and only incur additional holding costs. Therefore, I am continuing the 'zero order' strategy by setting the L=4 and minimizing mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3. The OR backend's capped base-stock policy will correctly result in zero units ordered since on-hand inventory + pipeline (155) >> demand requirements.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is near its end (Period 45 of 47). Current demand for this basic jersey T-shirt is in a deep seasonal trough, consistent with mid-December for a short-sleeved item. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is approximately 12 units/period. With 147 units on-hand and only 2-3 periods remaining, the inventory level is extremely high, covering over 12 periods of demand. Any further ordering would significantly increase holding costs without any potential for additional sales. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period regime to reflect the current low demand floor and ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders, as the on-hand inventory (147) far exceeds the calculated base stock for the remaining horizon.

Carry-over insight: Mid-December demand floor for jersey basics confirmed: average demand (P40-P44) remains very low at ~12 units/period, down from ~14 in November.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is near its end (Period 46 out of 47). Current on-hand inventory is 132 units, while demand in the mid-to-late December period is extremely low, averaging approximately 12 units per period (P40-P45). With a lead time of 4 periods and only one period remaining in the game, any order placed now would not arrive before the simulation concludes. Furthermore, the existing inventory of 132 units is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the final period (approx. 11-15 units). Therefore, L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are set to minimal levels to prevent any further ordering and minimize holding costs, while acknowledging the established low-demand regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is at its final period (Period 47, Dec 30). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt', which is currently in a deep winter seasonal trough. The demand has remained extremely low throughout December, averaging ~11 units per period (P43-P46: 11, 8, 15, 9). Current on-hand inventory is 123 units, which covers approximately 11 periods of demand at the current rate. There is no risk of stockout before the simulation concludes, and maintaining high parameters would only lead to unnecessary ordering or holding risk if the simulation were longer. However, since this is the final decision, ordering remains at zero as pipeline and on-hand inventory are more than sufficient. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime to ensure the OR backend does not place an unnecessary final order.
