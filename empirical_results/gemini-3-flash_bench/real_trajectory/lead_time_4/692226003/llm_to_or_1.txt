Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is a staple jersey tank top. Historical demand data shows a fluctuating but generally increasing trend since mid-January (from 75 to 142). The mean of the provided 5 samples is 114.2. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (lead time + current period). I will use the last 5 samples to calculate the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this recent trend while balancing volatility. As this is the first period, I will rely on the promised lead time (default).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Fitted strappy top', which is a spring/summer seasonal item. Historical demand from the provided samples (Jan-early Feb) shows a clear upward trend: 90, 75, 152, 112, 142. Period 1 demand was high (138), but we sold 0 units because we started with 0 inventory. We have 169 units in-transit from Period 1 with a promised lead time of 4. Given the seasonal nature and recent demand levels, the mean demand appears higher than the initial Jan samples. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent climb, which includes the Period 1 observation of 138. I will use 'default' for lead time (L) as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a basic jersey tank top (Anita Tank), which typically sees rising demand as spring approaches. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows an upward trend (90, 75, 152, 112, 142) and recent concludes show demand of 138 and 180. The average of all 7 samples is ~127. Current inventory is 0 on-hand because arrivals haven't started. The promised lead time is 4. The order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in P6). With demand increasing (180 last period), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent higher demand (avg ~145) rather than the lower January samples. L is kept at 'default' as no shipments have concluded to suggest a lead time drift yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a basic jersey tank top, which typically sees demand growth as spring approaches in the northern hemisphere. Historical demand samples (last 5) show an upward trend: 90, 75, 152, 112, 142. Recent actual demand in the game has been higher: 138, 180, 180 (average ~166). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 530 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (169 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5. Therefore, we still face a stockout in the current period (Period 4). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 game observations (N=3) to capture the higher recent demand level (avg 166) compared to the long-term historical mean (avg 114). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand regime. L is kept at default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead time shift.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a 'strappy top in soft jersey,' which exhibits seasonal growth as we approach spring (March). Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 90, 75, 152, 112, 142 (pre-game) followed by 138, 180, 180, 203 (in-game). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (169 units) are expected to arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 (this period). Consequently, we should see arrival confirmation in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Since no orders have concluded yet, we maintain the 'default' lead time of 4. For demand (mu_hat), the last 4 in-game samples (mean ~175) plus the pre-game samples indicate a rising regime; I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current higher demand level (~175/week) vs the early season lower levels. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the current variance.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a fitted strappy vest top, which typically sees increasing demand as spring progresses toward summer. Looking at the demand history, we observed a steady increase from initial samples (90, 75) to recent periods (203, 137), though Period 5 saw a slight dip. The average demand across all 10 available data points is approximately 131. However, the last 4 periods (P2-P5) show a higher average (~175). Promised lead time is 4, and the first order from P1 arrived exactly in P5 (lead_time=4), confirming the promised lead time holds. Currently, there is a large pipeline (787 units) and an ending on-hand of 32. To avoid stockouts during the transition to warmer weather, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the upward trend in demand while maintaining the default lead time. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Anita Tank' (Jersey Basic fitted strappy top), which is a classic spring/summer seasonal item. Current date is March 25, moving into peak spring demand. Historical demand is increasing: the last 5 periods (including samples and game history) show a clear upward trend (112, 142, 138, 180, 180, 203, 137, 167). The drop in Period 5 (137) appears to be an outlier or minor fluctuation given the overall trajectory. Observed lead time is exactly as promised (4 periods, confirmed in Period 5 and 6 conclusions). I will use a recent N (last 5 samples) to capture the higher demand regime, resulting in a mean weekly demand of approximately 173.4 units. Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods (approx 867) and maintaining sigma_hat based on the same window to handle the increased volatility seen in the higher demand phase. Pipeline inventory (738) and on-hand (40) total 778, which is slightly below the target base stock, justifying the continued ordering pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from late February: average demand increased from ~118 (initial samples) to ~173 (last 5 periods), likely due to seasonal transition into Spring/Summer apparel.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a 'fitted strappy tank top', which is highly seasonal towards Spring/Summer. Historically, demand was around 114 in Jan/early Feb, but since late February (Period 4), it has increased significantly. The last 4 periods show demands of 203, 137, 167, and 140, averaging 161.75. Given the April 1st date, we anticipate the 'Spring/Summer' peak is either maintaining or continuing to rise. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory is high (730 units) due to large orders placed in Periods 4-7. I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher regime while keeping L at the promised default.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). The product is a 'Fitted strappy top', a seasonal item (Tank top/Vest) moving into Spring/Summer. Observed demand in the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is significantly higher (avg ~165) compared to the initial January samples, though fluctuant. P8 saw a peak demand of 215. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (P5-P8 arrivals all confirmed 4-period lead times). Pipeline inventory is high (561 units) because we have 4 large orders in transit (P5-P8 orders). At the start of P9, on-hand is 77. We expect arrivals in P9 (from P5 order, 220 units), P10 (from P6, 126 units), P11 (from P7, 178 units), and P12 (from P8, 37 units). Using L=4, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Based on the 'Spring' regime shift, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 samples (P3-P8) to capture the higher mean (~174) and volatility, as demand for tank tops typically trends upward through April/May.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a tank top/vest top, which is seasonally relevant for the warming weather. The Carry-over Insight noted a demand regime shift around late February. Analysis of recent demand (Period 5-9: 137, 167, 140, 215, 131) yields an average of 158 units per period, compared to the initial 5 samples average of 114. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (confirmed by arrivals in P5-P9). On-hand is 166 and In-transit is 568 (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Since the promised lead time of 4 periods aligns with the actual observations, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the last 5 finalized periods P5-P9) to capture the higher volume and volatility of the current Spring regime compared to the early year baseline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Fitted strappy top', which is highly seasonal for spring/summer. Currently in late April (Period 11), demand is stable following the regime shift identified in Period 7. Demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10) has averaged 161.6 units per period, compared to the early-season average. Lead times have been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 10). I will use L=4 and set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period demand average (N=5) to capture the higher seasonal baseline while excluding the pre-shift low demand. Similarly, sigma_hat will be calculated using the recent 5 periods to better reflect current volatility as we move deeper into the spring season.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is a basic summer item. Since Period 7, we've identified a demand regime shift averaging ~173 units. Looking at the last 5 periods (Periods 7-11), the demand values are [140, 215, 131, 155, 154], which averages to 159.0 units. Including the most recent observations, the trend remains significantly higher than the initial January/February historical average of ~114 (90, 75, 152, 112, 142). Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, and P11). I will set L to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand springtime regime and ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock that accounts for the (4+1)=5 periods of demand required to cover the lead time and review period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Anita Tank' (Jersey Basic), which is a spring/summer staple. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to early samples. The average demand over the last 8 periods (since the seasonal shift in March) is approximately 160 units per period, while the last 5 periods (Periods 8-12) average 168.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 31.8. Current on-hand inventory is very low (12 units), making us heavily dependent on the pipeline. The lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit = 730) must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand, and expected demand for 5 periods is roughly 840 (5 * 168), we are slightly under-stocked relative to recent demand spikes. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current seasonal regime and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this demand level. L will remain at default (promised 4).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Fitted strappy top', a summer-season basic. Current date is mid-May (P14), moving into peak summer demand. Historical data shows a clear regime shift since late February (P4-P5), with demand increasing. Specifically, the mean demand of the last 6 periods (P8-P13) is 171.6, compared to the initial pre-February average of 114. Recent demand (P12: 186, P13: 189) suggests a slight upward trend as weather warms. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (as promised). Pipeline inventory is high (668 units), but consistent with a 4-period lead time and ~170/week demand (170 * 4 = 680). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable higher-demand regime while smoothing recent fluctuations. This covers the approximately 10 weeks since the demand shift became evident in early March.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~172 units/period from Period 8 onwards, confirmed by sustained demand through mid-May (P8-P13 range: 131-215). Forecast remains bullish due to summer seasonality for tank tops.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'tank top', which is highly seasonal for the current late May (Spring) and upcoming Summer periods. Demand in Period 14 spiked to 257 units, confirming a strong seasonal uptrend compared to the previous regime average of ~172 units. The stockout in Period 14 (ending inventory 0) indicates we are under-forecasting current peak demand. I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N=5 to capture the recent high-demand weeks (averaging 194 units per week over P10-P14). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, so L is set to 'calculate'. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to reflect the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. Monitoring on-hand inventory carefully as it is currently zero, though 700 units are in-transit to cover the lead time pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand spike confirmed mid-May: Period 14 demand reached 257 units (+49% vs previous regime average). Anticipate further increases as summer peaks.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'tank top', which is highly seasonal towards summer. As of late May (P16: 2019/5/27), we are entering peak summer demand. Historical data shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-7 averaged ~150, Period 8-13 averaged ~172, and Period 14 hit 257 (though P15 dropped back to 174). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with stockouts occurring in the last two periods (P14 sold 234/257, P15 sold 166/174). Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. Since the inventory is 0 and we are entering the peak sales month of June, I will use recent data to set mu_hat. I will set N=8 for demand-related parameters to capture the period since the last stable regime began (P8 onwards), while remaining slightly bullish to account for the seasonal uptrend in June.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak seasonality confirmed: Demand for jersey tank tops shows significant volatility and an upward trend entering June, with stockouts observed in P14 and P15 despite arrivals.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'fitted strappy top' (tank top), which is currently entering its peak summer season (June/July). We are currently in Period 17 (June 3). Over the last three periods (P14-P16), demand has consistently outstripped our available on-hand inventory, resulting in stockouts and lost sales (sold < demand, ending inventory = 0). While the arrived units in P16 were 141 (ordered in P12), the demand was 151 and would likely have been higher if more stock were available. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is currently 900 units, which covers approximately 4-5 periods of demand at the current high rates. To recover from consecutive stockouts and capture peak summer demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime (approx. 185 units/period average) while maintaining the default lead time. This will raise the base stock level to ensure we are protected against continued high seasonality and demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Consecutive stockouts observed in Periods 14, 15, and 16 due to summer seasonality; ending inventory has hit zero for three straight weeks despite consistent arrivals.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18 (June 10th), entering the peak summer season for the 'Anita Tank'. Looking at the history, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods. While P17 showed a dip in demand (89 units), this follows three consecutive stockouts in P14-P16 where demand was likely suppressed by zero inventory. The product is a seasonal summer item (strappy jersey tank top), so I expect demand to remain high or increase despite the P17 fluctuation. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the elevated summer regime (avg ~167 over last 4 periods) while still acknowledging the recent volatility. This provides a balance between the high demand of P14-P16 and the dip in P17. I'll use calculated lead time as the backend confirms it is stable at 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in mid-June (P19, Date: 2019/6/17). Historical demand for this jersey tank top showed a significant seasonal spike from Period 14 (demand: 257) through Period 16, resulting in three consecutive stockouts. However, the last two periods (P17 and P18) have seen a sharp, sudden decline in demand (89 and 92 units respectively), contrasting with the bullish 'Summer peak' expectation observed in May. This suggests either a cooldown or high volatility within the summer season. On-hand inventory has recovered to 212 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P14 order arriving exactly in P18). Given the recent drop in demand, I am shifting from a 'peak' forecast to a 'recent' forecast to avoid over-ordering and incurring holding costs, while still maintaining high service levels (q=0.95), especially since the product description ('soft jersey cotton blend') is highly relevant for the upcoming peak summer months (late June/July). I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the blend of the high May demand and the recent June slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in June: after a mid-May spike (P14-P16 avg ~194), demand significantly dropped in P17-P18 (avg ~91), suggesting high weekly variability despite summer seasonality.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we are in the peak summer season for the 'Anita Tank' (a jersey tank top). However, recent demand patterns show a significant shift. After a high-demand period in May (avg ~194 units, Periods 14-16), demand has dropped and stabilized at a lower level in June (Periods 17, 18, and 19 had demands of 89, 92, and 93 respectively). This suggests the initial summer surge or stock-filling phase has passed, moveing into a more steady mid-summer demand regime. Lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory currently at 378 and 547 units in-transit, we are well-stocked to handle the current demand level. I will adjust the mu_hat forecast to reflect this new 'steady June' demand level (approx 91 units/period) using recent_N (N=3) to focus on these last three consistent data points, while using default for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at 'calculate' as historical data shows it's stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from mid-June: average demand decreased from earlier summer peaks (~194) and stabilized at ~91 units/period (P17-P19), suggesting a transition from early-season surge to mid-summer steady state.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a jersey tank top. We are currently in early July (Period 21). Historical data shows a clear shift in demand regimes: a spring/summer buildup (P8-P13 avg ~172), a mid-May peak (P14-P16 avg ~194, though capped by stockouts), and a recent mid-summer stabilization at a lower level (P17-P20: 89, 92, 93, 117; avg ~98). While the carry-over insight noted a shift to ~91, the most recent demand was 117, suggesting demand is slightly higher or stabilizing around 100 as we hit the height of summer. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (509) and in-transit units (299), totaling 808 units, we are well-covered for the (L+1) window (approx 500 units needed). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this mid-summer stabilization (~98 per period) and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current volatility as we move past the early season spikes.

Reviewing historical demand for this Jersey Tank Top, there was a significant surge from early May to early June (P14-P16), likely representing an early summer peak or promotion. However, demand shifted to a lower, stable regime starting in mid-June. Over the last five periods (P17-P21), demand has averaged approximately 96.2 units (89, 92, 93, 117, 90). Our on-hand inventory is currently very high at 622 units, plus 96 units in-transit (ordered in P18 and P19). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the current demand rate, our pipeline and inventory are more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods of demand (estimated at ~481 units). The OR backend should naturally stop ordering due to the high base stock level. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect this stabilized mid-summer demand regime and prevent over-ordering during the seasonal taper. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~96 units/period starting Period 17 (observed P17-P21), down from the early summer surge (~194 units/period in P14-P16).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Anita Tank' (fitted strappy top) is in the mid-summer steady state. Demand has stabilized significantly since early June (Period 17), with the last 6 periods (P17-P22) averaging 95.7 units per period and displaying much lower volatility compared to the May peak. We are currently overstocked with an on-hand inventory of 610 units, which is approximately 6.4 periods of supply at the current demand rate (610 / 95.7 \u2248 6.4). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods (L+1 = 5), and we have 15 units in transit, our total pipeline inventory (625) is more than sufficient to cover the 5-period horizon. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods according to 'conclude' messages. To prevent additional holding costs, I am maintaining parameters that align with the current lower demand regime (recent_N=6) to allow the OR backend to continue suppressing new orders until the inventory level falls to a more efficient service level.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '692226003' (Anita Tank) is currently in a mid-to-late summer phase. Historical demand peaked significantly in mid-May (P14-P16) but has since settled into a lower, stable regime. For the last 7 periods (P17-P23), demand has averaged approximately 89 units per period (89, 92, 93, 117, 90, 93, 56), showing a marked decline from the early summer surge. The lead time has remained consistently at the promised 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 569 units with 0 units in-transit. Given that the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (covering L+1=5 periods of demand), and the average demand is ~89, the required base stock is roughly 445 units. Since on-hand inventory (569) already exceeds this level, the backend will naturally stop ordering. I will set L to 'calculate' as the historical lead time is stable at 4, and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the current lower demand regime (starting P17). Sigma_hat will also use N=7 to reflect the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~89 units/period starting Period 17 (observed P17-P23), confirming the end of the early summer peak. Late July demand (P23: 56) suggests a potential further downward trend as the season progresses.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a jersey tank top, entering late July (2019/07/22 concluding, 2019/07/29 decision). Demand has shifted significantly downward from the early summer peak. In the last 8 periods (P17-P24), demand averaged ~84 units/period, but the most recent two weeks (P23-P24) show a sharper decline to 56 and 47 units respectively, indicating the end-of-season tapering. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 522 units with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4, the total inventory pipeline covers over 5-6 weeks of demand even at the 84-unit average, and nearly 10 weeks at the recent 50-unit pace. To avoid excessive holding costs on a seasonal item that will likely continue to decline in demand, I am using a recent_N of 8 to capture the mid-to-late summer average for mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at default (4). The backend OR engine will likely result in zero orders given the high on-hand surplus relative to the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand (P23-P24) confirms a sharp downward seasonal trend for tank tops, dropping to ~52 units/period, roughly 60% of the mid-summer steady state of ~89 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a jersey tank top, which is highly seasonal. We are now in early August (Period 26), and history shows a clear downward trend in demand as the summer season peaks and moves toward autumn. Late July demand (Periods 23-25) has dropped significantly to an average of ~49 units/period, down from the mid-summer steady state of ~90. With on-hand inventory at 479 units and zero in-transit, the current stock is extremely high relative to recent demand (nearly 10 periods of coverage). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To avoid high holding costs while demand continues to fade, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current low-demand regime. This will likely result in zero orders until the excess inventory is depleted.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Anita Tank) is a seasonal summer item (tank top). We are currently in mid-August (Period 27), and demand has shown a clear downward trend as the peak summer season ends. Recent demand figures for Periods 23-26 are 56, 47, 43, and 32 respectively, averaging approximately 44.5 units per period. This confirms the 'Late July' downward trend noted in carry-over insights is continuing into August. On-hand inventory is very high at 447 units with zero in-transit, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 10-14 periods (well beyond the promised lead time of 4). No new orders have been placed since Period 19. My objective is to prevent further accumulation of holding costs while the existing stock is depleted. I will use the recent_N method (N=4) to capture the current late-season demand regime (~44.5 units/period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. L remains default as lead times have consistently been 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: August demand confirms a continued post-summer decline, dropping to an average of ~45 units/period (P23-P26), down from the mid-summer steady state of ~89 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a jersey tank top, which is highly seasonal. We are currently in late August (Period 28), and historical demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27: 56, 47, 43, 32, 47) shows a clear and sustained decline as summer concludes, averaging ~45 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 400 units, which, at the recent demand rate, covers roughly 9 weeks of future demand. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and the pipeline is empty, the current stock is more than sufficient to cover the (L+1) window of 5 periods (~225 units required). To avoid increasing holding costs for a seasonal item entering its off-season, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the lower demand floor and use default lead time and sigma parameters. The OR engine will likely result in a zero order given the high on-hand balance relative to the new demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Late August demand continues the post-summer decline, stabilizing at an average of ~45 units/period (P23-P27). On-hand inventory represents significant overstock (approx. 9 weeks of supply) relative to this end-of-season demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is currently in a significant late-season demand decline as of late August. Recent demand (P23-P28) has consistently averaged ~45 units/period, a sharp drop from the mid-summer average of ~89 and the early summer peak of ~194. On-hand inventory is currently 354 units, which represents approximately 7.8 periods of supply at the current demand rate of 45/week. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, total pipeline coverage is required for (L+1) = 5 periods. Current inventory is already significantly higher than the required base stock, creating a substantial overstock situation. Therefore, the goal is to stop ordering and allow on-hand inventory to bleed down. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 6-period average to reflect this late-season decline and keep L at the default promised value, as historical arrivals have been consistent with a 4-period lead time.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (early September). The product is a jersey tank top, which is heavily seasonal. Historical demand shows a clear end-of-summer decline: Period 17-22 averaged ~96 units, Period 23-28 averaged ~45 units, and Period 29 just recorded a low of 17 units. On-hand inventory is 337 units, which at the current trailing average of ~38 units/period (last 7 periods), represents over 8 weeks of supply. Since lead time is 4 periods and the season is winding down, we are significantly overstocked. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs on a declining seasonal item, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering late July through August) to reflect the current low-demand regime, and L remains at the stable promised lead time of 4. The OR backend will see the high on-hand + pipeline inventory against this lower base stock target and correctly output zero orders until inventory is naturally depleted.

Carry-over insight: September demand confirms the end-of-season transition: Demand has dropped to an average of ~38 units/period over the last 7 weeks (P23-P29) and hit a season low of 17 units in P29. Significant overstock persists.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Anita Tank) is entering the end-of-season phase in September. Demand has continued to drop sharply: Period 30 demand was only 8 units, down from 17 in Period 29. The average demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) is approximately 20 units/period. The current on-hand inventory of 329 units is extremely high, covering over 15 weeks of supply at current demand rates. There are 29 units in-transit (ordered P28), expected to arrive in Period 33. Given the $1.0 holding cost and the rapidly declining demand, the priority is to avoid any further ordering and allow inventory to bleed down. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this late-season decline and minimize the base stock level, ensuring no new orders are triggered while we are overstocked.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Late-season demand collapse confirmed; September demand has dropped to single digits (8 units in P30), bringing the 4-week average to ~20 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a jersey tank top, and the current date is mid-September. Historical data shows a clear end-of-season collapse in demand: from ~200 units in peak summer (May/June), down to ~90 in mid-summer, and now dropping to single-digits (8 units in both P30 and P31). Current on-hand inventory is 321 units, which at the current demand rate (avg ~13 units/period over the last 4 periods), represents approximately 24 weeks of remaining supply. With only 15 periods left in the game and a holding cost of $1.0 vs. $19 profit, the priority is to liquidate existing stock and avoid any new ordering. I have set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this terminal seasonal state, which will result in a base stock level far below the current on-hand + in-transit (350), effectively stopping all new orders.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season terminal demand reached in September: Demand has stabilized at single digits (avg 8 units/period over P30-P31), representing a final seasonal drop from the late-August average of ~45.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Anita Tank) has entered its terminal seasonal phase as of late September. Demand has plummeted from summer peaks of ~194 to a current single-digit regime (averaging ~9 units over the last three periods: 8, 8, 12). There is a massive overstock situation with 338 units on-hand, which represents nearly 37 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the negligible demand, the goal is to prevent any additional ordering. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods to reflect this low-demand state, which will keep the base stock well below the current on-hand plus pipeline inventory, ensuring no new orders are placed as the game nears its end.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Anita Tank) is a summer-seasonal jersey tank top. We are currently in late September, approaching October. Demand has stabilized at extremely low levels following the summer season. Specifically, the last four periods (P30-P33) show demand of 8, 8, 12, and 18, averaging 11.5 units per period. This confirms the terminal demand regime identified in Carry-Over Insights. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 320 units, which, at current demand rates, represents approximately 27 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this stable, low-demand end-of-season period. The backend will naturally calculate a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand + pipeline inventory, resulting in zero orders while the overstock is gradually cleared.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Anita Tank) has reached its terminal end-of-season phase in October. Demand has stabilized at single to low-double digits (P30-P34 avg: 11.2 units/period). On-hand inventory is currently 310 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents approximately 27 weeks of supply. Given the 13 periods remaining in the game (ending P47), the current stock is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to reflect this terminal demand state (approx 10-12 units/period) and maintain a zero-order policy via the OR backend. Lead time L is set to default (4) as arrivals are consistent and lead time is not the constraint.

Carry-over insight: Terminal demand state confirmed for October: Demand average has dropped to ~11 units/period (P30-P34). Existing inventory (310 units) is sufficient for all remaining periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) has reached its terminal demand phase as of mid-October (Period 36). Demand has consistently remained in the single or low double digits since Period 30, with an average of approximately 8.6 units/period over the last 6 weeks (P30-P35: 8, 8, 12, 18, 10, 5). Current on-hand inventory is 305 units, while there are only 12 periods remaining in the simulation (P36 to P47). Even at a conservative estimate of 15 units/period, total remaining demand would be roughly 180 units. Therefore, the existing inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs and decrease total reward. To prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=1 (the most recent very low demand sample) to keep the base stock calculation as low as possible, below the current high on-hand levels.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Anita Tank) is in a terminal end-of-season state as of late October. Demand has stabilized at very low levels, with an average of approximately 9.5 units/period over the last seven weeks (P30-P36). Current on-hand inventory is 291 units, which is enough to cover over 30 periods of demand at current rates\u2014far exceeding the remaining 11 periods of the game. The goal is to avoid all further procurement to minimize holding costs while liquidating existing stock. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' based on consistent historical performance (L=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime (approx. 10 units/period), although the backend's base-stock calculation will result in zero orders given the massive inventory surplus.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is in a terminal end-of-season state as of late October. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 10 units per period over the last 8 weeks (P30-P37: 8, 8, 12, 18, 10, 5, 14, 11). The current on-hand inventory of 280 units is extremely high relative to this demand, providing over 25 weeks of coverage while only 10 periods remain in the game. No further orders are required. The parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand regime and high inventory position to ensure the OR backend does not trigger any unnecessary replenishment, thereby avoiding additional holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The product is a jersey tank top, which is highly seasonal. We are now in Period 39 (early November), well into the off-season. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 10 units per period over the last 9 weeks (P30-P38). Current on-hand inventory is 274 units, which is enough to cover the remaining 8 periods of the game (total demand expected ~80 units) without any further ordering. To prevent incurring additional holding costs and accumulating more unnecessary stock, I will maintain the current strategy of not ordering by setting the inventory targets to reflect the terminal demand regime. L is kept at default as there are no in-transit orders to track, and mu_hat/sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=9, covering the off-season period) to reflect the low-demand environment.

The current on-hand inventory is 266 units, which is enough to cover the remaining 7 periods of the game (totaling ~63 units of expected demand) more than four times over. Any further ordering would only increase holding costs without contributing to sales. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect this low-demand state and rely on the existing stock.

Demand has reached a terminal low state, averaging approximately 8 units per week over the last 11 periods (P30-P40). Current on-hand inventory is 261 units, which is enough to cover more than 30 weeks of demand at the current rate. Since there are only 7 periods remaining in the simulation, no further orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to a very low explicit value (1) to prevent the OR backend from triggering any safety stock orders and use the default lead time. The objective is to minimize holding costs by liquidating existing stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 42 with only 5 periods remaining in the simulation. The product is a jersey tank top, which is currently in a terminal demand state (winter season). Recent demand from Period 35 to Period 41 has been consistently low, averaging approximately 7.7 units per period (sampling: 5, 14, 11, 6, 8, 5, 5). Current on-hand inventory is 256 units, which is far more than enough to cover the expected total demand for the remaining 5 periods (estimated at ~40-50 units total). The lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now would only arrive in Period 46, at which point it would be entirely surplus. To maximize reward, we must avoid further holding costs and utilize existing stock. I am setting parameters to ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 out of 47, deep in the off-season for jersey tank tops (December). Demand has consistently been in the single digits for the past several weeks, with the most recent Period 44 demand at 3 units. On-hand inventory is 242 units, which is far more than enough to cover the remaining 3 periods of the simulation (Periods 45, 46, and 47). No further orders are needed, as my goal is to minimize holding costs while the game concludes. I will maintain parameters that reflect this terminal demand state to ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (late December) with only one period remaining in the game (Period 47). The product is a jersey tank top, which is highly seasonal and currently in its terminal low-demand phase. Demand over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) has averaged 6.6 units per period. We have 228 units on-hand and zero in-transit. This current inventory level is far more than enough to cover the demand for the final period (Period 47), especially since any order placed now (Period 46) would not arrive until Period 50 (based on a 4-period lead time), which is beyond the game horizon. To maximize total reward, we must avoid any further ordering and minimize holding costs. I will set the base stock level to be extremely low by using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current terminal demand, ensuring the OR backend calculates an order of zero given our high on-hand inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, marking the final period (47) of this cycle. The product (jersey tank top) is in a definitive terminal demand state for the winter season. Over the last 17 periods (P30-P46), demand has averaged approximately 7.8 units per period, with the most recent week showing 9 units. On-hand inventory is currently 219 units, which is enough to cover over 25 weeks of terminal-level demand. Since the game concludes this period, there is no need to place additional orders. The target is to minimize further holding costs while maintaining a service level for the negligible remaining demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 to capture the stable terminal demand state and maintain the default lead time. No parameters will trigger an order due to the high inventory-to-demand ratio.
