Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Harrison short sleeve top'. Historical demand shows a downward trend from 346 in early January to 172 on Feb 4. This likely represents a post-holiday/winter clearance slowdown. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the product is a short-sleeved jumper in a viscose blend, it is a transitional piece suitable for early spring. As we move into February/March, demand may stabilize or begin to rise as part of a new season. For the initial period, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current lower demand level rather than older high peaks, setting L to default (4) as no actual lead time data is yet available. This will target covering demand for (4+1) periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-02-18. We are in Period 2. The product is a short-sleeved jumper. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the Period 1 order of 344 units is in-transit (promised lead time is 4). Last period's demand was 203, which resulted in 203 lost sales because of 0 starting inventory. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) show a downward trend: 346, 235, 196, 176, 172. The Period 1 demand (203) suggests a slight uptick or stabilization compared to the early February lows. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the recent stable-to-decline regime (averaging approx 187/week) rather than including the January spike (346). Setting L to default (4) as we have no data yet to suggest lead time drift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a short-sleeved knitwear top. Demand samples (Jan/Feb) show a decreasing trend from ~350 down to ~170, but actual demand in Period 1 and 2 (203, 311) suggests higher volatility or a shift. On-hand remains 0 because orders placed in P1 and P2 (total 556 in-transit) have not arrived. With a promised lead time of 4, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 and show up in P6's decision phase. Since we have no completed lead-time data yet, I will use lead time 'default'. For demand, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent averages (avg of P2, P1, and the last 3 samples: 311, 203, 172, 176, 196 = ~212 per week), which is safer than the full average given the product is likely moving toward a spring trend.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. This SKU is a 'short-sleeved jumper', which typically sees stable or increasing demand as spring approaches. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks: 346, 235, 196, 176, 172) and recent gameplay demand (203, 311, 235) show significant volatility but no clear trend yet. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 862 units in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, our first order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (Start of Period 6). Since we have no completed lead-time data yet, I will use the 'default' lead time of 4. For demand forecasting, the average of the last 8 weekly samples (5 historical + 3 game) is approximately 234.3. Using (1+L) = 5, the total expected demand (mu_hat) is set to 1172. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent volatility observed in game play and historical data.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Womens Tailoring Knitwear' short-sleeved jumper. Demand samples (including history: 346, 235, 196, 176, 172 and observed: 203, 311, 235, 150) show a general downward trend from initial peaks, with an average around 220. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (344 units) are expected to arrive during the Arrival Resolution of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (P1 order is still in transit). In-transit is 1172 units (P1: 344, P2: 212, P3: 306, P4: 310). Since we are nearing the promised lead time for the first order, I will use recent_N for demand to capture the recent stable range (approx. last 5 samples: 172, 203, 311, 235, 150) which averages ~214. L is kept at default (4). The backend will calculate base_stock to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a women's short-sleeved knit jumper. We are currently in mid-March (Period 6). Historical demand samples from January (346, 235, 196, 176, 172) show a downward trend from a winter peak. Recent demand in the game (P1-P5: 203, 311, 235, 150, 122) confirms this declining or stabilizing trend as we move into spring. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and the P1 order arrived exactly in P5 (4 periods later), confirming L=4. We currently have 222 units on hand and 828 in transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which means the base stock should target the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). Since demand has shifted from an average of ~225 in Jan/Feb to ~136 in the two most recent periods (P4/P5), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent stabilization while acknowledging the higher early-game demand. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The item is a women's short-sleeve fine-knit top, which is transitioning into a spring/summer seasonal demand period. Historical demand shows a downward trend from February peaks (avg ~250) to March (avg ~140). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and the two completed shipments (P1 arriving P5, P2 arriving P6) confirm an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 287, and we have 616 units in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the median demand to minimize total cost. I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the lower March levels and calculate for L to stick to the proven 4-period lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a short-sleeved fine-knit top, which is seasonally appropriate for Spring. Historical demand shows a significant shift: Periods 1-3 averaged 249.7 units/week, while Periods 4-7 dropped to an average of 144.25 units/week. This suggests an initial spike followed by stabilization or a decrease in early Spring demand. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Current inventory is 435 on-hand with 310 in-transit (ordered P4, expected in P8 conclude). Total coverage (on-hand + in-transit) is 745. Given stabilized demand of ~145 units/week, (L+1) demand is approximately 725. The current pipeline is sufficient. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower demand regime seen since March, while keeping L at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: average weekly demand decreased from ~250 to ~145 (-42%).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's short-sleeve knit top. Historical demand shows a significant drop around Period 4: samples P1-P3 averaged ~250, while P4-P8 averaged ~152 (-39%). The most recent demand (P8) was 181, following a sequence of 150, 122, 147, 158. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5-P8). Inventory is currently high (on-hand: 564) because large orders placed in the high-demand regime (P1-P4) have all arrived while demand has softened. No units are currently in transit. Given the high on-hand stock and lower demand regime, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize. I will use a window of N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-shift demand regime (P4-P8), ensuring the base stock calculation is grounded in the current lower demand level.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 is currently in a sustained lower demand regime that started around Period 4. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P4-P9) is approximately 139.7 units per week, which is a significant drop from the pre-P4 average of ~250. The current on-hand inventory (484) plus in-transit (187) totals 671 units. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~140, 5 periods of demand equals 700 units. Since 671 is close to this target and the holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the backend's capped policy will likely result in a small or zero order to avoid overstocking and high holding costs. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture this lower demand regime and default for lead time as historical arrivals (P5-P8) have consistently matched the promised 4-period lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Demand analysis: The carry-over insight noted a drop at Period 4, but demand has continued to decrease further in the last two periods (P9: 80, P10: 75) compared to the P4-P8 average of ~150. This likely reflects the end of the spring season for this 'Harrison short sleeve top'. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the lower regime that began around P4 while acknowledging the recent further softening. Lead time analysis: Observed lead times (P1-P4 orders) have been consistently 4 periods as promised. Pipeline: Orders from P9 (187 units) and P10 (28 units) are in-transit, totaling 215. Inventory: On-hand is 409, which is high (over 5 weeks of current demand). Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. The OR backend will likely order 0 units this period because on-hand + in-transit (624) significantly exceeds the base stock for a 0.5 critical ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: average weekly demand decreased further from ~150 to ~77 (-48%) potentially due to spring/summer seasonality transition.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a fine-knit viscose blend short-sleeve top. Observed demand is in a significant downturn: Period 1-3 averaged ~250, Period 4-8 averaged ~152, and the last three periods (9-11) have averaged ~70 (80, 75, 54). This likely reflects seasonality as the weather warms and consumers shift away from knitwear, or a trend decay for this specific SKU. Currently, on-hand inventory (355) is very high relative to recent demand, and there are 244 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 9, 10, and 11). Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.50, meaning the inventory target should be the median demand to minimize total costs. With a promised lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the most recent 3 samples (avg 70) suggests a base stock level of ~350, which is already met by on-hand inventory alone. I will set mu_hat to reflect this lower demand regime using the last 3 samples to prevent further over-ordering while the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: 3-period average dropped to 70 units/week (-53% from previous regime), coinciding with late spring seasonality for knitwear.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019/05/06). The product is a short-sleeved knitwear top. Analysis of the demand history shows a tiered decline: Period 1-3 averaged ~250 units, Period 4-8 averaged ~150 units, and Period 9-12 averaged ~70 units. This significant drop matches the transition into late spring for knitwear. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (based on the first four orders arriving exactly 4 periods later). Currently, on-hand inventory is 287 and in-transit is 244 (from orders in P9, P10, and P11). Given the current demand regime of ~70 units/week, the pipeline (531 units) covers more than 7 weeks of demand. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy where q = 0.5 (since Profit=1 and Holding=1), targeting the 50th percentile of demand over the (L+Review) period. Using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will correctly capture the new low-demand regime (~70/week) and prevent over-ordering while we work through high existing stocks.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. This SKU is a fine-knit viscose blend short-sleeved jumper. Demand has consistently declined as we move deep into the spring/summer season, confirming a low-demand regime for knitwear. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13) has been 80, 75, 54, 68, and 42 respectively, averaging approximately 64 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Order P9 arrived P13). On-hand inventory is currently high (432 units) relative to recent demand, and there are 57 units in-transit (orders from P10 and P11). I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the contemporary low-demand level (approx 64 * 5 = 320 for review+lead time). The current inventory (432 + 57 = 489) already significantly exceeds the likely base stock requirement, so the OR backend will correctly stop ordering to reduce holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-238.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved knitwear top, which typically sees declining demand as summer approaches. Demand has stabilized at a lower level since Period 9. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P9-P14) is 71.6 units/week (80, 75, 54, 68, 42, 111). The spike to 111 in Period 14 is likely an outlier or a small late-spring fluctuation, as the 4-week moving average remains around 68. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (P9 arrived in P13, P10 arrived in P14). On-hand inventory is 349 units, with 29 in transit (ordered P11, arriving Period 15), totaling 378 units of pipeline stock. Given the low demand and high holding cost relative to profit ($1:$1), the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) of demand (approx 72 * 5 = 360 units). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect this low-demand regime and prevent over-ordering while maintaining a lean safety stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 16 (2019/5/27). In Period 15, we saw a sudden and significant demand spike to 272 units, which is a major deviation from the previous low-demand regime (~70/week). This spike coincides with the transition into late May/June, likely representing a late-spring or pre-summer surge for this short-sleeved knit top. The on-hand inventory has dropped to 106 units with zero in-transit shipments remaining. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we must immediately replenish to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture both the preceding low period and this recent spike, weighting the average towards a recovery in demand (average of periods 9-15 is ~100 units/week). I will use explicit values to communicate a higher demand expectation and volatility to ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to meet this new trend while avoiding stockouts during the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Significant demand spike to 272 units observed after a sustained low-demand period (~70 avg), signaling a potential seasonal surge for summer garments.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678942001' (short-sleeved jumper) is experiencing a radical shift in demand as we move into summer (June 3rd). A significant spike occurred in Periods 15 (272) and 16 (246), following a low-demand spring period where demand averaged ~70. This surge depleted all on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales in Period 16 (on-hand 0, demand 246). We currently have 233 units in-transit (ordered Period 16), which are expected to arrive in Period 20 (L=4). To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last two weeks of data, as these represent the active summer surge. I'll use recent_N=2 to capture this 250+ units/week trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Periods 5-8 and 13-15).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 15: Transition to summer peak for short-sleeved knitwear with demand increasing from ~70 to >250 units/week (+250%).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'Harrison short sleeve top' is currently in a summer peak regime, which began at Period 15. The demand for the last three periods (P15-P17) has been 272, 246, and 244 units, respectively, indicating a stable and high demand level of approximately 254 units per week. Due to a stockout at Period 16 and zero on-hand inventory since then, we have lost significant sales. We currently have 523 units in transit (ordered in P16 and P17), which are expected to arrive in P20 and P21 based on the consistent 4-period lead time. With the current date of June 10th and the product being a short-sleeved fine-knit top, this peak demand is expected to continue through the summer months. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this current high-demand regime (~254 * 5 = 1270). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this peak, and L is set to 'calculate' as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'Harrison short sleeve top' is currently in a summer peak season, which began around Period 15 (June). Demand in the last four periods has been 272, 246, 244, and 202, averaging ~241 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 803 units (from Period 16, 17, and 18). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The order from Period 16 (233 units) is expected to arrive in Period 20, the order from Period 17 (290 units) in Period 21, and the order from Period 18 (280 units) in Period 22. Given the stockout (on-hand 0 since Period 16), it is critical to maintain base stock levels that reflect the new high-demand regime. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat captures this summer peak (mean ~241), which when multiplied by (1+L)=5, targets a base stock of ~1205. The current pipeline of 803 units leaves a gap to be filled to maintain stock levels against the summer surge.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Harrison short sleeve top (knitwear), currently in a high-demand summer regime that started around Period 15 (June). Demand in the last five periods has been 272, 246, 244, 202, and 130. While Period 19 shows a decrease to 130, the overall summer average (approx. 218 units/week) is significantly higher than the previous spring low (approx. 70 units/week). Lead times have consistently been 4 periods. Since Period 16, I have placed orders of 233, 290, 280, and 289 units, all of which are in-transit (total 1092). The first significant replenishment (233 units ordered P16) is expected to arrive during the current Period 20 and be observable at the start of Period 21. Until then, on-hand inventory is 0. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current summer demand regime (average ~219). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5) at current demand levels.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Harrison short sleeve top, which fits summer seasonality. We are currently in Period 21 (July 1st), which is the heat of summer. Demand spiked significantly starting Period 15, likely due to a summer surge. However, the last two periods (P19: 130, P20: 120) show a cooling trend from the peak of >240. I will adjust the mu_hat to account for this recent deceleration while maintaining a high safety stock for potential late summer volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P16 order arrived in P20). I have a large in-transit pipeline (861 units) from orders placed in P17-P20, which will start arriving in Period 21. Given the high pipeline and slightly declining demand, the OR backend's capped policy will likely modulate the order size. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the summer regime while acknowledging the recent dip (last 6 periods average ~192).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed in Periods 19-20 (avg ~125) compared to the Period 15-18 peak (avg ~240), indicating the initial summer surge may be stabilizing.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678942001' (Harrison short sleeve top) is currently in its summer peak. Demand spiked significantly starting in Period 15 (avg ~240 units/week during P15-P18) but has cooled down in recent weeks (avg ~138 units/week during P19-P21). Period 21 demand was 163, showing a slight uptick from P19 and P20. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P20 and P21). I am using recent_N (N=7, covering Period 15 to 21) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher summer demand regime while smoothing the transition from the extreme spike to the current moderate level. This ensures we carry enough stock for the (L+1) window (approx 5 weeks) without over-ordering as the summer season progresses.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization confirmed: Period 19-21 average demand is ~138 units, down from the P15-P18 peak of ~240 units but significantly higher than the spring low of ~70 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved fine-knit top, which is highly relevant for the current summer season. Demand history shows a peak in mid-May/early June (P15-P18 avg ~241), followed by a dip in late June (P19-P20 avg ~125), and a significant rebound in the most recent periods (P21-P22 avg ~192). The last observed demand was 221 units, indicating that summer demand remains strong and volatile. Lead times have been consistently stable at 4 periods. With 299 units on-hand and 464 units in-transit (orders from P19, P20, P21, P22), the pipeline is relatively full. However, to maintain a high service level given the recent upward trend in demand and the high volatility (sigma), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current summer demand level (~159 units/week) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to account for the high variance observed during the summer transition. Lead time L is set to default as 4 periods remains the consistent observation.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand rebound: Period 21-22 average demand increased to 192 units/week, reversing the brief cooling trend seen in P19-P20 and confirming sustained high summer volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Harrison short sleeve knit top, which is currently in its peak summer season (July 2019). Demand has been volatile but sustained at a high level compared to spring, with recent demand figures of 163, 221, and 171 units over the last three periods (average ~185). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 417 units, and 205 units are in transit (ordered in Periods 20-23). To maintain service levels given this summer volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs (as profit and holding costs are equal), I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 samples (starting from Period 15, the summer spike) to capture the current high-demand regime, and using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance observed during this peak season.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for this short-sleeved knitwear item has shown significant volatility throughout the summer. After a peak (P15-18, avg ~240) and a stabilization period (P19-21, avg ~138), recent demand has been 171 (P23) and 83 (P24). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P15-P24) is approximately 175 units. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (P20-P24 arrivals confirm this). Given the high volatility (sigma) and the transition towards late summer/early autumn, I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the summer demand profile while being responsive to the recent drop. This balances the risk of stockouts from summer spikes against holding costs as the season potentially winds down.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand volatility remains high in mid-to-late summer; average demand over P15-P24 is ~175 units, but weekly fluctuations range from 83 to 272.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Historical demand for this 'short sleeve knitwear' item spiked in mid-May and has remained highly volatile through the summer (P15-P25), with a recent average of approximately 175 units per week but fluctuations ranging from 83 to 272. The pipeline inventory (552 units) is currently high due to large orders placed in P24-P25 to cover previous volatility. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and the potential for demand to taper off as we transition from late summer into autumn (as seen in early spring), I will set mu_hat based on the average of the entire summer regime (P15-P25, N=11) to capture the base demand level while using a similarly recent N for sigma_hat to account for the significant variance seen in the last few months.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 is a short-sleeved jumper, currently in the mid-to-late August period. Demand over the last 8 weeks (P19-P26) has stabilized after the initial summer surge, averaging approximately 142 units per week (min 83, max 221). The 'summer surge' seen in P15-P18 (avg ~241) appears to have transitioned into a more stable but still volatile late-summer regime. Actual lead time remains consistent with the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P16 through P22). With 261 units on-hand and 492 in-transit, there is sufficient stock to cover the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized late-summer demand level and its associated volatility. This N captures the period from P19 to P26, post-initial peak.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand stabilization (P19-P26): average demand has moderated to 142 units/week from the P15-P18 peak of 241 units/week.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019, which is the transition period from late summer to early autumn. The product is a short-sleeved fine-knit viscose blend top. Historically, this product saw a demand surge in mid-summer (P15-P18, avg ~240) followed by a stabilization phase. However, Period 27 saw a significant spike to 234 units, indicating that demand remains volatile and high as we head towards the end of the season. On-hand inventory is low (57 units), but in-transit inventory is very high (462 units), primarily driven by the large order of 285 units from P24 which is expected to arrive in Period 28 conclude. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods. Given the recent spike and the nature of the product, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 periods (P19-P27) to capture the current late-summer regime (avg ~152 units) while keeping sigma_hat high to account for the volatility seen in P27. The large in-transit pipeline will prevent over-ordering through the OR backend's base-stock logic.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand spike: Period 27 demand (234 units) shows continued high volatility despite previous signs of stabilization, suggesting demand for transition knitwear remains strong into late August.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26), a period typically seeing a transition from peak summer demand to late-summer/pre-autumn volatility for knitwear products. Looking at the history, the lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Since Period 15, we have seen a high-demand regime with high volatility (range 83-272). The most recent demand samples are P27: 234 and P28: 175, following a previous moderation. This suggests that while demand is not at the extreme peak of P15-P16, it remains significantly elevated compared to the spring low and highly unpredictable. I will use a recent_N of 14 for demand (covering the period since the summer surge started in P15) to capture this high-volatility summer average (~175 units) while filtering out the extremely low spring data. Given the balanced profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), a base stock targeting a 50% service level is theoretically optimal for the backend, but the high sigma_hat from recent volatility will naturally provide a safety buffer. On-hand is 167 with 412 in transit (total 579), which covers roughly 3.3 weeks of average demand; we must maintain orders to cover the full L+1 (5 week) window.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved knitwear item, which usually experiences strong demand during transition periods (late summer into early autumn). Recent demand (P27-P29: 234, 175, 140) confirms this volatility, averaging 183 units/week. While demand moderated slightly in P29, the late-August surge suggests the 'back-to-school' or 'autumn transition' phase is in effect. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 129 with 586 units in-transit. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the last 6 weeks since P24) to capture the late-summer volatility and transition average, which is approximately 147 units/week. This balances the high spike in P27 with the more moderate P28-P29 values. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the significant variability observed in this seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition demand (P27-P29): Sustained high volatility observed with an average of 183 units/week, significantly higher than the early August average of 142 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are transitioning from late summer into autumn. Demand for this short-sleeved knitwear item has shown sustained high volatility and strength over the last 15 periods (since the summer surge began). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is approximately 165 units, with a recent 3-period average (P27-P30) of 188 units, indicating that the transition to autumn has not yet cooled demand. Inventory is currently low (On-hand: 13), and while in-transit stock is high (530 units), we must ensure we cover the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period's demand (L+1 = 5 periods). A recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=6 captures this current high-demand volatile regime (avg ~165). Sigma_hat should also reflect this recent volatility to maintain service levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition (P27-P30): Demand remains high and volatile with an average of ~188 units/week, suggesting sustained interest in knitwear despite the end of peak summer.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 is a short-sleeved jumper, which has shown sustained high demand during the transition from summer into autumn (September). Recently, demand has consistently exceeded 170 units per week (P27-P31 avg: 187). In Period 31, a stockout occurred (on-hand 0, sold only 13 of 195 units), indicating that supply is struggling to keep up with this late-season volatility. The in-transit pipeline (769 units) includes orders from P28 (235 units), P29 (276 units), P30 (19 units), and P31 (239 units). With a consistent lead time of 4 periods, the P28 order (235 units) is expected to arrive in Period 32, which will resolve the current stockout. To maintain a high service level given the current volatility (std dev ~35 in the recent period) and the high demand average (~188), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5, covering the autumn transition). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (5 total periods of demand).

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition demand (P27-P31) confirmed: Average demand is 187 units/week with high volatility, sustained for 5 periods, significantly higher than the early August average of 142.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September (2019/09/23). Demand over the last 6 periods (P27-P32) has stabilized at a high level with an average of 180 units/week (specifically: 234, 175, 140, 191, 195, 147). This transition from summer to autumn knitwear demand is sustained and volatile. Lead times remain stable at the promised 4 periods. With only 88 units on-hand and high demand, we must ensure the pipeline covers the (L+1)=5 period horizon. Currently, 700 units are in transit, which is substantial, but includes recent large orders from P29 (276) and P31 (239). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture this current 180 units/week regime. sigma_hat is also calculated over the same period to account for the observed volatility. These parameters will help the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock level for the transition into October.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition regime (P27-P32) confirmed: Average demand is 180 units/week with significant volatility, sustained for 6 periods (replaces P32 insight).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Sept 30, 2019. We are in an 'Autumn transition regime' which began around Period 27. Over the last 7 periods (P27-P33), demand has averaged 186.5 units/week (234, 175, 140, 191, 195, 147, 224) with significant volatility. The most recent demand (P33) was 224 units, indicating the seasonal interest in this short-sleeved knitwear remains high. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (arrived P32 from P28, arrived P33 from P29). On-hand inventory is 140, and in-transit is 538 (orders from P30, P31, P32, P33). I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific autumn regime's mean and volatility while keeping L at the default promised/observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition period (P27-P33) confirmed: Sustained high demand for short-sleeved knitwear with an average of 187 units/week and high volatility (standard deviation ~32).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in an autumn transition regime for this short-sleeved knitwear item. While demand dropped to 100 in Period 34, the preceding weeks (P27-P33) showed a sustained high average of approximately 187 units/week with significant volatility. The current on-hand inventory is low (59) and we experienced a stockout in Period 31. Although pipeline inventory is high (765), we must maintain high base stock levels to account for the high volatility (sigma) and the 4-period lead time. I will stick to the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) using N=8 to capture the autumn transition period (starting P27) while including the recent lower datum. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-100.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 is a short-sleeved jumper. Demand has transitioned from a high-volatility summer/autumn peak (avg ~180 units/week) to a cooling phase in October. The last two periods (P34, P35) saw demand drop significantly to 100 and 99 units, respectively. This likely signals the end of the 'Autumn Transition' regime as the weather gets colder, reducing demand for short-sleeved knitwear. Consequently, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this cooling trend while maintaining enough safety stock for lingering volatility. On-hand + In-transit (199 + 581 = 780) is substantial, covering nearly 8 weeks of the current reduced demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (P33-P35: avg 141) to bridge the transition and default lead time settings as deliveries remain consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Demand for short-sleeved tops has cooled from ~180 to ~100 units/week (-44%) as of mid-October, signaling the end of the autumn transition peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-225.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Harrison short sleeve top (a viscose blend knitwear item) has clearly transitioned into a lower-demand autumn-winter regime. Since Period 34, weekly demand has dropped significantly from an average of ~180 units to approximately 90 units (P34: 100, P35: 99, P36: 70). The carry-over insight from Period 36 correctly identifies this cooling. Current inventory status shows 295 units on-hand and 415 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are already overstocked for the current demand level (approx. 710 total units vs a forecasted demand for the next 5 periods of ~450 units). Therefore, I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods, use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to reflect the current 90 unit/week regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the decreased volatility. This will signal the OR backend to stop ordering until inventory levels align with the new lower demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 confirmed: Average weekly demand has decreased from ~180 to ~90 units/week (-50%) across the last 3 periods, signaling the end of the autumn transition peak and the start of a late-autumn/winter low-demand period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Harrison short sleeve top has shifted into a lower-demand late-autumn/winter regime (Period 34 onwards), with the last four periods averaging approximately 85 units/week (100, 99, 70, 79). This is a significant drop from the autumn transition peak (~180 units/week). Currently, on-hand inventory is 330 units and in-transit is 301 units (from orders in P34 and P35), totaling 631 units of coverage. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods (confirmed by history), we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the current rate of ~85 units/week, the requirement is roughly 425 units. Since total inventory (631) significantly exceeds this requirement and the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), the priority is to avoid overstocking while demand continues to cool. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current lower demand level and rely on the OR backend's inventory balancing to minimize holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-494.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Harrison short sleeve top has entered a clear late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Average weekly demand over the last four periods (P35-P38) is approximately 72 units, which is a significant drop from the autumn peak of ~180 units. The most recent demand (P38) was 41 units, suggesting a potential further decline as we move into November. Currently, on-hand inventory is 535 units, which is extremely high (covering over 7 weeks of demand at current rates), with another 55 units in transit (expected to arrive in Period 39 from the order placed in P35). Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), excess inventory is highly penalizing. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting L to default, mu_hat to 72 units/week using the recent 4-period regime (N=5 as a proxy for the shift), and sigma_hat using the same N to capture the lower volatility of the current regime. The high on-hand and pipeline inventory will naturally prevent the OR backend from placing more orders, which is necessary to bleed off the excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Weekly demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~72 units (P35-P38), confirming a seasonal transition to winter lows for short-sleeved knitwear.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short-sleeved knit top) has entered a clear low-demand regime as of Period 35, coinciding with the transition into late autumn and early winter (November). Demand over the last five periods (P35-P39) has been 99, 70, 79, 41, and 33 units, respectively, showing a consistent downward trend. The current average demand for the last 4 periods is approximately 56 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 557 units with zero in-transit, which is more than sufficient to cover approximately 10 weeks of demand at the current rate (557 / 56 \u2248 10). Given the lead time is 4 periods and we are near the end of the simulation (Period 40 of 47), the objective is to minimize holding costs while maintaining a 50% service level (as profit=holding cost=$1.0). Carrying significant excess inventory into the final periods will incur unnecessary holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this winter low, and sticking to the promised lead time (L=4) which has remained consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Weekly demand has dropped further from ~75 to ~37 units (average of P38-P39), suggesting a deepening winter low for short-sleeved items.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short-sleeved knitwear) is experiencing a sharp seasonal decline as winter approaches. Demand has dropped from an autumn average of ~180 units/week to a very low current level (~17-33 units/week). Period 40 demand was just 17 units. On-hand inventory is currently 540 units, which is extremely high (covering over 15 weeks of demand at current rates). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given that holding cost equals profit ($1.00), excess inventory is highly penalized. No more orders should be placed. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the deep winter low of roughly 33 units/week, and sigma_hat similarly to capture the lower volatility in this regime. The OR backend will see that on-hand (540) significantly exceeds the calculated base stock, resulting in a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime confirmed (P38-P40): Average demand has dropped to ~30 units/week (-60% from the previous low-demand estimate of 75).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a short-sleeved knitwear item, which is currently in its winter low-demand phase (late November). Demand has stabilized at extremely low levels, with the last four periods showing demand of 41, 33, 17, and 21 units respectively. This constitutes a significant decline from the previous autumn transition period (~180 units/week) and even the early October average (~75 units/week). Current on-hand inventory is 519 units, which is exceptionally high given the current demand rate (sufficient for over 20 weeks of supply). With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (ending Period 47) and a promised lead time of 4 periods, any new order placed now would arrive in Period 46, just as the game ends. Given the high holding costs equal to profit ($1.0) and the massive inventory surplus, I will use a restricted demand forecast (recent_N=4) to accurately reflect the winter low and ensure the OR backend does not place further unnecessary orders.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 is a short-sleeved jumper. We are currently in early December (Period 43, 2019/12/02). Demand has transitioned into a winter low-demand regime, though Period 42 showed a slight uptick to 68 units (possibly a Black Friday/Cyber Monday effect), up from the 17-21 unit range seen in Periods 40-41. Despite this uptick, the product remains out-of-season for winter. On-hand inventory is very high at 451 units with zero in-transit. Given a winter average demand of approximately 34 units (P38-P42 mean), the current stock covers over 13 weeks of supply. Therefore, the priority is to avoid placing new orders to minimize holding costs while the existing inventory naturally depletes. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this lower seasonal demand level. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019 (Period 44). We are in a winter low-demand regime for this short-sleeved knitwear item. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P38-P43) is approximately 33 units/week, with the most recent demand being 20 units. On-hand inventory is currently 431 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining 4 periods of the game (total estimated remaining demand is ~132 units). There is zero in-transit inventory, and no further orders are needed. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), and the excess stock already on hand, the goal is to prevent any additional ordering to minimize further holding costs. Setting L to the promised 4 and using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will reflect the low winter demand, resulting in a base stock level far below current on-hand inventory, thus triggering zero orders from the OR backend.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a short-sleeved knitwear item, currently in the mid-December winter low-demand period (Date: 2019/12/16). Demand has consistently stayed at very low levels since Period 38, with the most recent week showing only 15 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 416 units, which is extremely high given the current demand regime (~30 units/week). At this rate, the current stock covers over 13 weeks of demand, far exceeding the (L+1) requirement. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (P38-P44) to reflect this winter low and ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation recognizes the surplus. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. We are in the middle of the winter low-demand regime for this short-sleeved knitwear item. Since Period 38, demand has consistently dropped, and the last 8 periods (P38-P45) have averaged ~29 units per week (min 15, max 68). The 68 demand in P42 appears to be a minor outlier or a small gift-buying bump, but it hasn't sustained. On-hand inventory is currently very high (396 units), which is approximately 13-14 weeks of stock at the current average demand. With zero in-transit units and holding costs equal to profit ($1.0), the objective is to deplete this excess inventory before placing any new orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this stable winter low, ensuring the base stock calculation remains well below current on-hand levels to refrain from ordering.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved knitwear item, which is currently in a deep winter low-demand regime. Since Period 38 (Oct 28), demand has been consistently low, with the Period 41-46 average approximately 29 units per week. Specifically, the last four periods (P43-P46) show an average of 21 units. On-hand inventory is currently 367 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover demand for the promised lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods), even if demand were to triple. At the current rate (~30 units/week), 367 units covers over 12 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the period since the start of the winter low at P38) to reflect this stabilized low-demand environment and allow on-hand inventory to be slowly consumed, reducing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime (P38-P46) sustained: Average weekly demand is ~28 units, confirming the deep seasonal low for short-sleeved items through end of year.
