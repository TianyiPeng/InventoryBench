Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Long Leggings' for Women, a staple 'Everyday Basic' item. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the first period, we have no transit history or current inventory. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a stable pattern with a mean of 103.4 units and a standard deviation of 10.9 units. The periods are: 113, 101, 106, 85, 112. There are no major seasonal shifts or holidays immediately apparent in mid-February for this basic apparel item that would justify an 'explicit' forecast change yet. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent stable regime for both demand mean and volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, which is approximately 517 units.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey leggings', a staple item. Initial demand in P1 was 125, which is consistent with the provided samples (range 85-113, avg 103). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory because the P1 order (123 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods (expected arrival in P5). My objective is to set parameters so the OR backend targets a base stock level covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the demand history, the mean is approximately 103.8. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 4) and 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the most recent stability. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect observed volatility. This ensures we order enough in P2 to account for the pipeline and the missed sales in P1 (demand was 125, sold 0), while being aware that the OR backend will cap the order based on the pipeline inventory (123) and safety stock logic.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019/02/25). The product is 'Long Leggings', a basic everyday item. Observed demand in P1 (125) and P2 (199) is significantly higher than the initial historical samples (mean ~103), suggesting a strong upward trend or seasonality as we move into spring. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed all demand so far due to lead time. Promised lead time is 4. No orders have arrived yet, which is expected as the first order (P1) isn't due until P5 (P1+4=P5, visible P6). In-transit inventory (253) covers the P1 and P2 orders. To address the demand surge, I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture the higher mean (~162) and volatility from the most recent periods, ensuring the OR engine sets a higher base stock to meet this new demand level once shipments begin arriving.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Women's Jersey leggings, a staple basic. On-hand inventory is 0 because all orders placed since Period 1 are still in transit (Promised Lead Time = 4). History shows zero arrivals because the first order (P1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in Period 6. Demand for the last 5 pre-game weeks was stable (avg ~103), but since starting, demand has spiked (P1: 125, P2: 199, P3: 140). The P2 spike (199) might be a random fluctuation or a transition to a higher spring baseline. Given the 19.0 profit vs 1.0 holding cost, the target service level is high (~95%). I will use recent_N=3 for the demand forecast to capture the recent higher activity while maintaining the promised lead time of 4 until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The SKU is 'Jersey leggings', a basic item. Historical demand (pre-game + Periods 1-4) shows a mean of approximately 117 units. However, demand in Period 2 spiked to 199. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we expect the first order (placed in Period 1) to arrive during Period 5. Therefore, the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which we will read at the start of Period 6) should show arrival. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have concluded yet. Total in-transit is 722 (sum of orders from P1-P4). L is set to 'default' (4) as we have not yet observed any completed lead time cycles to justify a change. For mu_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (5 pre-game samples + 4 game samples) to capture the base demand level plus recent volatility. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the variance seen in the Period 2 spike.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is Women's Jersey Leggings, a basic item. We have observed 10 historical demand points (5 pre-game, 5 in-game). Historical demand shows fluctuations but has stabilized somewhat lower in the last three periods (140, 90, 56) compared to the spike in Period 2 (199). The average demand across all 10 periods is approximately 112. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which was confirmed by the Period 1 order arriving in the Period 5 conclude message (4 periods). Currently, we have 67 units on hand and 599 in-transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4), which is substantial given the mean demand. The OR backend will calculate the order based on (1+L) periods of demand. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (~560 units). Since pipeline inventory (666 total) already exceeds this, the backend will likely place a zero or minimal order, which is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs while we wait for the pipeline to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand average over 10 periods is ~112 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Long Leggings', a basic garment. Historically (including pre-game samples), demand has been relatively stable around 100-112 units per period. The recent demand history in-game (Periods 1-6) shows values of 125, 199, 140, 90, 56, and 99. The average across all 11 available data points is ~115. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 98. In-transit consists of orders from P3 (249), P4 (220), and P6 (38), totaling 507. Since lead time is stable and demand shows no significant recent changepoint or seasonal spike for late March, I will use 'default' for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=6 to capture the in-game behavior while balancing against the pre-game samples. This maintains a lean inventory while accounting for the ~115 average demand per period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is 'Long Leggings', a basic garment. Reviewing the history: Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Demand history shows relative stability despite early spikes. The demand samples are: [113, 101, 106, 85, 112, 125, 199, 140, 90, 56, 99, 112]. The mean of all 12 samples is ~111.58. The last 5 samples (P3-P7: 140, 90, 56, 99, 112) average 99.4. However, the early spikes in P1/P2 (125, 199) might have been related to the start of the season or inventory shortages elsewhere. Since we have sufficient on-hand (235) and a large pipeline (425), we aim to maintain a steady base stock. L is set to 'default' (4). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand stabilization observed since P1 of the game (125, 199, 140, 90, 56, 99, 112), acknowledging the variance without over-weighting the initial extreme spike. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to match this window.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is 'Women's Long Leggings', a basic garment item with relatively stable demand. Historical lead time analysis confirms L=4 (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived exactly in 4 periods). Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged ~118 units (125, 199, 140, 90, 56, 99, 112, 128), which is consistent with the initial seed data (avg ~103). There are no immediate significant seasonal triggers in early April for this staple item, though demand has trended slightly higher recently compared to March. Pipeline inventory (297 units) represents the orders from P6, P7, and P8. Current on-hand is 327. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 to capture the full trajectory since the simulation start, as it provides a more robust estimate of current variance and mean than the long-term historical seed. Lead time will be set to 'calculate' given the consistent performance observed.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings', which typically exhibits stable demand. Historical demand over the last 10 samples (including pre-game and game history) shows a mean of ~114 units, with recent periods (P5-P9) averaging 96.8 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P5, P6, P7, and P8). In Period 9, no arrival was expected since P5 order was 0 units. We have 238 on-hand and 420 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Total pipeline inventory is 658 units. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 5 samples (P5-P9) to set mu_hat compensates for the slight dip in demand after the initial P1-P2 spike, preventing overstocking while maintaining a high service level (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is 'Long Leggings', a basic garment. Historical demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 112.6 units (sum of demand: 1126). There is a slight downward trend in the last few periods (89, 87), but no definitive regime shift yet. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in periods 5 through 10 (except for P5, where no order was placed). Pipeline inventory is 382 units (orders from P7, P8, and P9). On-hand inventory is 189. Total coverage (on-hand + pipeline) is 571 units. Given (L+1) = 5, and average demand ~112, we need ~560 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable demand mean and 'calculate' for lead time since the promised 4-period lead time is being met consistently.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P6, P7, P8, P10, and P11 conclusions all confirm LT=4), matching the promised lead time. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings) has remained relatively stable since the start of the game, with a mean of approximately 111 across all 16 available data points (historical + game history). While there was an early spike in Period 2, recent demand (last 5 periods) has averaged 106.2. Since this is an 'Everyday Basic' item, I will use a medium-term average (recent_N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which balances recent observations with enough history to capture the baseline variance. Current inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 592) is healthy relative to the expected demand over the lead time (1+L = 5 periods), but maintaining parameters based on the stable 10-period regime will ensure the OR backend keeps the pipeline filled against the calculated optimal service level.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods across five consecutive observations (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P7 orders). Demand regime is stable for 'Everyday Basics' with a long-term mean of ~111 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 13 (2019-05-06). The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey leggings. Historical lead time observation from the game history (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand analysis: The long-term average demand is approximately 111-112 units. Recent demand (last 8 periods since the initial stockout/filling phase ended) shows a mean of 97.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. There is no strong evidence of a seasonal shift yet for 'Everyday Basics' in May. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (representative of the stable demand period after initial inventory arrived) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current variance and mean, and use 'calculate' for L to remain consistent with observed arrival patterns.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' jersey legging. At Period 14 (May 13), demand remains stable without significant seasonal shifts observed in the historical data (Jan-May). The confirmed lead time is consistently 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, and now P9). Specifically, the P9 order (123 units) arrived in P13, exactly 4 periods later. Current on-hand (280) and in-transit (245) totals 525 units. With an average demand of ~111-112 units per period, the current pipeline covers approximately 4.7 periods of demand, which aligns well with the (L+1) = 5 period requirement for a lead time of 4. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to leverage the consistent history, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=13 (all periods since the game began) to capture the stable 'Everyday Basics' regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' jersey legging, which typically exhibits stable demand. In Period 15 (May 20), we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods based on history (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, and P9 all arrived with L=4). Period 14 'arrived=0' is expected because no order was placed in Period 10. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 395, and on-hand is 176. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a mean of approximately 99.7 units, showing a slight decrease compared to the first 5 samples provided in the context (mean ~102). Given the 'Basics' nature and consistent lead time, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the current stable regime. Lead time is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is verified by actual arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2588.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Long Leggings' belongs to the 'Everyday Basics' category, which has shown a stable demand pattern. For Period 16 (late May), there is no significant seasonal evidence suggesting a major shift from the established mean of approximately 111-112 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods across all successfully concluded shipments. Note that the order from Period 10 was 0, explaining the gap in arrivals for Period 14. We currently have 167 units on hand and 259 in transit (including orders from P12, P14, and P15). This pipeline (426 units) covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain the service level across the (L+1) period horizon (5 periods), I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most stable recent demand regime while filtering out the initial volatility from Periods 1-4. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/03), the product 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings' continues to show stable demand. The mean demand over the last 10 periods (Periods 7-16) is approximately 107.3 units, closely aligning with the long-term historical mean of ~111. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by the arrivals in Periods 13, 15, and 16). The order from Period 14 (150 units) is expected to arrive in Period 18. Current inventory position: On-hand (167) + In-transit (289) = 456 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target pipeline inventory should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~535-555 units). I will use L=4 (default), and mu_hat based on the stable recent history (N=10) to maintain stock levels for this evergreen item. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to reflect the stable volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 18 (June 10, 2019). The product 'Women's Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings' has shown a stable demand pattern with no significant seasonal spikes during the spring/early summer transition. Historical data and game history (including pre-game samples) show a steady mean. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 15 periods (since Period 3) is approximately 104 units, and the standard deviation over the last 10 periods remains stable. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on multiple concluding shipments (P1 through P12). Order arrivals are consistent (P9 arrived P13, P11 arrived P15, P12 arrived P16), though P10 was notably zero and the P13 order was also zero, which accounts for the current inventory levels. The 'in-transit' of 429 units matches orders from P14 (150), P16 (139), and P17 (140), all expected within the next 1-3 periods. I will use a recent window of N=15 for demand mean and N=10 for sigma to capture the current stable 'Everyday Basics' regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1466.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings' has shown a stable demand pattern with a long-term mean of ~111 units. Current date is June 17th. Demand in the last 5 periods has slightly dipped (avg ~81 units), but given the category 'Everyday Basics', these fluctuations are treated as variance rather than a structural regime shift. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (Period 14 order arrived in Period 18, lead_time=4). Current on-hand inventory is 168, with 339 units in-transit (orders from P16, P17, and P18). The OR backend is configured with 'calculate' for lead time to use the stable observed average. For mu_hat, 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering all available game history) is chosen to capture the full stable distribution of this staple item, providing a robust base stock that balances the high profit margin ($19) against holding costs ($1).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (2019/6/24), the SKU 179123001 (Women's Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings) maintains a stable demand regime despite the start of summer. Historical demand analysis shows a mean of 111.9 over the full history and 106.6 over the last 10 periods, with no evidence of significant seasonal spikes yet (Everyday Basics are typically evergreen). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (validated in periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (47 units) as it is the end of Period 19, and we are awaiting arrivals from orders placed in Periods 15 (ordered=0), 16 (ordered=139), 17 (ordered=140), and 18 (ordered=60). The 'In-transit' totaling 489 units matches the pipeline (139+140+60+150). Given the stability, I am using recent_N=10 for demand (mu_hat) and sigma_hat to capture the current variance while relying on the 'default' promised lead time of 4.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings', which typically exhibits stable year-round demand with minor fluctuations. The historical demand shows a consistent pattern with a mean around 100-110 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has shown some volatility (145, 109, 63, 86, 121, 49) with a mean of 95.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on 'Period 20 conclude' where the P16 order arrived exactly 4 periods later. On-hand inventory is 137, with 404 units in-transit (orders from P17, P18, P19, P20), confirming a healthy pipeline. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has proven stable. For mu_hat, I will use a 'recent_N' of 15 to capture the stable 'Everyday Basics' regime while filtering out the initial stock-out period noise. For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' of 15 will be used to capture recent volatility.

Currently, at Period 22 (July 8, 2019), demand remains stable without significant holiday or seasonal shifts observed in the recent data. Lead time is consistently 4 periods: Period 17's order arrived exactly on Period 21. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is 195. In-transit consists of orders from P18 (60), P19 (150), P20 (54), and P21 (45), totaling 309 units. The pipeline is healthy. I will continue using the default lead time (4) and use recent_N=10 for demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the most relevant recent mean (~89 units/period in the last 10 periods) and volatility, as there was a slight downward trend compared to the earlier periods (Avg ~111). This ensures the base stock reflects the current stable but slightly lower demand phase.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Long Leggings' is an 'Everyday Basic' item. Current status shows an on-hand inventory of 189 units and 316 units in-transit. Analysis of the game history confirms a stable actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time (proven by arrivals in Periods 20, 21, and 22). Demand over the last 10 periods (P13-P22) has averaged ~88 units per period, which is a slight decrease from the earlier average of ~111 units. Given the seasonal transition into mid-July, demand for basic jersey leggings typically remains stable or softens slightly. I am choosing the 'calculate' method for the Lead Time parameter based on the consistent 4-period observations. For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent slight softening in demand while maintaining a sufficient buffer for an 'Everyday Basic' product. For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=10 is used to appropriately scale the safety stock to recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: average units per period decreased from ~111 to ~88 over the last 10 periods (P13-P22).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings', which typically exhibits stable demand but has shown a recent softening. As recorded in the carry-over insights at Period 23, the demand mean has shifted from ~111 to ~88 units per period over the last 10 periods (P13-P22). Period 23 saw a demand of 80, confirming this lower regime. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P19 order arrived in P23 with L=4). With on-hand inventory at 259 and in-transit at 221, we have a total pipeline of 480 units. Using recent_N=11 (P13 to P23) for demand estimation captures this lower regime while smoothing volatility. Parameters are set to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation (covering 5 periods of demand) reflects this updated lower mean to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level suitable for a high-profit ($19) versus low-holding-cost ($1) item.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics' Jersey Leggings, which generally shows stable demand but has recently experienced a softening trend. Data from Period 13 to Period 24 (last 12 periods) confirms a downshift in mean demand from ~111 to ~85 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P20-P24) show an average demand of 69.6 units, while the last 10 periods (P15-P24) average 77.2 units. Given this sustained lower demand, I will use recent_N (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering during this softer cycle. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent conclusions (P19 and P20 arrived on time); therefore, I will continue using the 'calculate' method for L. Current on-hand inventory is 242 and in-transit is 238, which is sufficient for covering several periods of the current demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~77 units over the last 10 periods (P15-P24), down from the long-term mean of ~111.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. We are in a confirmed lower demand regime for 'Womens Everyday Basics' leggings. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand has stabilized at 77.2 units, a significant decrease from the early-year average of ~111. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P20 and P21 orders arriving exactly at L=4). Pipeline inventory (258) plus current on-hand (221) totals 479 units. At the current demand rate of ~77 units/period, this covers over 6 periods of demand. Since lead time is 4, we are slightly overstocked relative to the new demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to align the OR engine's target stock with the lower 77.2 average, which will naturally reduce new orders until inventory levels normalize. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to utilize the stable historical observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $872.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P20-P26: 49, 82, 66, 80, 71, 66, 58) confirms a persistent downward shift in the demand regime for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Leggings). The average demand over these last 7 periods is approximately 67.4 units per period, which aligns with the carry-over insight from P25 noting a drop from the long-term mean of ~111 to ~77. Given the most recent four observations are particularly low (71, 66, 58, and previous 80), I will set N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume accurately while providing enough samples for variance calculation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P22 order arriving in P26.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened and stabilized: Average demand over P20-P26 is ~67 units/period, down from the previously identified ~77 units/period in P25.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 179123001 (Womens Everyday Basics Leggings) has clearly softened and stabilized at a lower level since early July. Analysis of the recent 8 periods (P20-P27) shows demand values: 49, 82, 66, 80, 71, 66, 58, 52. The average over these 8 periods is 65.5 units, significantly lower than the long-term mean of ~111. The last three periods specifically show a downward trend (58, 52) following a stabilized stretch. To avoid excess inventory while maintaining service levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent regime (N=8). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P23 order arrived P27), so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean: Average demand over P20-P27 is ~66 units/period (compared to historic ~111).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 179123001 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings) has transitioned from a high-demand regime (~112 units/period) to a significantly lower and stable regime. This shift is consistent with late summer demand for basic layering items before the autumn transition. Analysis of the most recent 9 periods (P20-P28) shows a very stable demand mean of 63.77 units (range 49-82). The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (254 units) relative to the current demand (~64 units/period) and a lead time of 4, our current inventory covers nearly 4 periods of demand without further ordering. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this lower mean (63.77) and lower volatility, ensuring the OR backend adjusts the base stock level downwards to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the 19:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new low: Average demand over P20-P28 is ~64 units/period, showing a ~43% reduction from the initial historical mean of ~111 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' leggings has significantly shifted from a historical mean of ~111 units to a much lower sustained level. In the last 10 periods (P20-P29), demand has averaged approximately 62.3 units (49, 82, 66, 80, 71, 66, 58, 52, 50, 49). The most recent 5 periods (P25-P29) are even lower, averaging 55 units. Given the consistency of this downward trend, I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture the current regime while maintaining some stability against individual period noise. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history (P25 arrived in P29). Inventory is currently high (270 on-hand) relative to this lower demand, so the OR backend will likely minimize ordering to reduce holding costs until inventory aligns with the new base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean: Average demand over P20-P29 is ~62 units/period, confirming a long-term reduction from ~111.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings'. After a significant demand drop observed starting around Period 20, the demand has stabilized at a lower mean. Over the most recent 11 periods (P20-P30), the average demand is approximately 61 units per period (672 total / 11), with relatively low volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (205) and current in-transit (88), the inventory position is 293 units. At a forecast of ~61 units/period, this covers nearly 5 periods, which is close to the L+1 requirement. I will use a recent_N of 11 to capture this lower, stable regime and allow the OR backend to adjust orders downward to prevent excess holding costs while maintaining the high service level required for a $19 profit / $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~61 units/period (P20-P30), confirming a sustained ~45% reduction from the initial historical mean of ~111.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 179123001 (Womens Everyday Basics Leggings) has shifted to a lower plateau compared to early periods. From Period 20 to Period 31, demand has averaged ~61 units per period, showing a significant drop from the initial average of ~111. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 162 and there are 152 units in-transit (total pipeline = 314), we are well-positioned to meet the current lower demand regime without excessive ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility parameters, setting N=12 to focus on the stabilized demand pattern observed since around Period 20, ensuring the OR backend's service level calculation is based on current mean and variance rather than historical highs.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period 32 (97 units) shows a significant spike compared to the recently established low-mean regime (~61 units/period). This spike may be associated with the transition into autumn seasonality for leggings. Period 30 and 31 arrivals (from orders in Period 26 and 27) were zero, which aligns with the fact that zero units were ordered in those periods. The order from Period 28 (3 units) arrived in Period 32, confirming the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent demand spike and the product category 'Everyday Basics' potentially seeing seasonal uplift in late September, I will adjust the demand forecast to be more responsive. I will use a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat to capture the transition from the low-demand summer phase toward the current autumn activity, while maintaining a recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to reflect the recent increase in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Potential seasonal demand uplift detected: Period 32 demand (97) significantly higher than the P20-P31 average (~61).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' leggings is clearly entering a seasonal peak or experiencing a significant regime shift, with demand jumping from a low of ~61 units (P20-P31) to 97 (P32) and 121 (P33), which slightly exceeded on-hand inventory leading to a stockout. The date (late September) suggests a Fall/Winter seasonal transition. I am moving to an 'explicit' forecast to respond aggressively to this uptick. I will forecast a mu_hat based on an anticipated demand of 120 units per period over the (L+1) horizon. With L=4 (stable), mu_hat = (4+1)*120 = 600. I'll maintain a higher sigma_hat explicitly to account for the current volatility and prevent further stockouts. Note: The order from Period 30 (scheduled to arrive in Period 34 resolution) and Period 31 (scheduled for Period 35) are currently in-transit, totaling 235 units, but starting on-hand is 0.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak confirmed: Demand increased to 97 (P32) and 121 (P33), returning to or exceeding the original historical mean (~111).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 35 (early October). Recent demand data for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (Long Leggings) shows a clear seasonal uplift: P32=97, P33=121, P34=98. This confirms a return to the historical mean of ~111 after a summer slump. We are currently out of stock (on-hand=0) and lost sales in the last two periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P30 order arriving in P34. Given the seasonal peak and the need to recover from a stockout, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime (avg ~105/period). This will set a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1)=5 period horizon, helping the OR engine to place a large enough order to replenish inventory and meet the sustained autumn demand.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak sustained: Periods 32-34 average 105.3 units/period, roughly matches the initial historical mean (~111).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Long Leggings' is experiencing a seasonal demand recovery. Recent demands (P32-P34) spiked to 97, 121, and 98, returning to values near the original historical mean of ~111. Period 35 demand dipped slightly to 62, but the overall trend over the last 4 periods (AVG ~95) suggests a regime significantly higher than the summer low of ~61. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P31 order arriving in P35. On-hand inventory is extremely low (2 units), so the OR backend needs parameters that reflect the higher seasonal mean to ensure adequate restocking amidst high pipeline inventory (433 units).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' leggings SKU. We are currently in mid-October (Period 37). Analysis of recent demand shows a seasonal peak occurred from Periods 32-34 (actual demand: 97, 121, 98), followed by a cooling off in Periods 35-36 (62, 57). The last two periods suggest the demand is returning to the stable 'softened' regime observed before the peak (which was ~61-64 units). However, the system is currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) due to the preceding peak, although 523 units are in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent prolonged stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs as the peak subsides, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) with N=5 (P32-P36). This captures the tail end of the peak (avg ~87 units) to provide a safety buffer, while acknowledging the downward trend. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility during this transition. Lead time remains 'default' (4).

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal peak demand adjustment: Demand spiked in P32-P34 (avg ~105) but has returned to lower levels in P35-P36 (avg ~60), suggesting a return to the previously identified ~61 units/period regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Womens Everyday Basics' leggings. Based on the history, we saw a demand surge in P32-P34 (Avg ~105) which likely corresponded to a late-summer/back-to-school or seasonal transition period. Following that, demand returned to a lower stable regime in P35-P37 (Avg ~61). The current observation (P37 conclude) shows demand at 64. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 27 units on-hand and a return to the ~61 units/period regime, I need to ensure the pipeline covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent stable regime (N=3 for P35-P37) which captures the return to lower demand while acknowledging the seasonal spike is over. Sigma_hat is set to default to cover general volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1017.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '179123001' (Womens Everyday Basics Leggings) has completed a seasonal peak (P32-P34) and returned to a stable lower demand regime. Over the last 4 periods (P35-P38), demand has averaged 61 units (values: 62, 57, 64, 61), which aligns perfectly with the pre-peak average of ~61 units identified in Period 31. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With 142 units on-hand and 268 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 410), we are currently overstocked relative to the (L+1) demand requirement (approximately 5 periods * 61 units = 305). However, given the product is a staple ('Everyday Basics'), maintaining stability is key. I will set L to 'default' (4), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stabilized post-peak mean, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current lower volatility. The OR engine's capping mechanism will likely limit ordering until the excess inventory is digested.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal peak stabilization: Demand recovered from P32-P34 spike (avg ~105) to a stable baseline of ~61 units/period (P35-P38), matching the pre-peak regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historical analysis shows a stable lead time of 4 periods. The demand for these 'Everyday Basics' leggings has recently returned to a baseline regime of approximately 61 units/period after a seasonal peak in September/October (P32-P34). The most recent demand samples are 57, 64, 61, and 35, confirming the post-peak stabilization mentioned in the carry-over insights. With 235 units on hand and 140 units in transit (expected from orders in P36 and P37), the pipeline of 375 units is sufficient to cover approximately 6 periods of demand at the current rate (~61 * 6 = 366). Given the high holding cost relative to the risk of stockout in a stable low-demand period, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent baseline (N=5) and stay with default sigma and calculation-based L to avoid over-ordering while maintaining a safe buffer.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand baseline reinforced: Average demand for P35-P39 is ~55 units/period, slightly lower than the pre-peak baseline of ~61, suggesting a potential further softening of demand as winter approaches.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Long Leggings - Everyday Basics' has returned to a stable lower-level regime following the September seasonal peak. Over the last 6 periods (P35-P40), demand has averaged 56.5 units/period, which aligns with the pre-peak softened baseline of ~61 units. The most recent demand (P40: 60 units) reinforces this. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Current inventory (On-hand: 303, In-transit: 36) is very high, equivalent to approximately 6 periods of supply at the current demand rate. This surplus is a result of large orders placed during the temporary September spike (P34-P36). To maximize reward by minimizing holding costs while maintaining the target service level, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 6-period post-peak regime (N=6). This will allow the OR backend to recognize the over-stock position and suppress further ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand baseline confirmed: average demand for P35-P40 is 56.5 units/period, stabilizing significantly below the historical mean of ~111.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Everyday Basics' leggings has stabilized in a lower regime following a brief seasonal spike in September (P32-P34). For the last 7 periods (P35-P41), demand has averaged 53.8 units/period, significantly lower than the initial historical mean of ~111 and the spike average of ~105. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 277 units, which is quite high relative to the current demand rate (~5 weeks of stock). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the low demand trend, I will use a recent_N approach (N=7 to capture the post-spike stability) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current lower requirements and avoid over-ordering while maintaining a healthy service level.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike of 208 units, which is a significant outlier compared to the post-seasonal baseline of ~56 units. Given the date (2019/11/25), this clearly corresponds to Black Friday / Cyber Monday sales. This is a temporary seasonal peak, not a permanent regime shift. However, upcoming December dates suggest continued holiday volatility. My pipeline (37 units: 24 units from P40 and 13 units from P42) + on-hand (69 units) totals 106 units. Current lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the 208 units spike just occurred, demand is likely to stay elevated or return to the ~60 units baseline. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 captures the pre-spike baseline and the current spike (Avg P35-P42 = 72.8). To ensure we cover potential December surges while avoiding excessive holding costs from the outlier, I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the increased risk and recent mean shift.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand spike confirmed at Period 42 (demand=208). Expected seasonal volatility through December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-Cyber Monday period (Period 44, Dec 9). Historical data and product description ('Womens Everyday Basics | Jersey Leggings') suggest high demand volatility through December due to holiday shopping. Period 42 saw a major spike (208 units), while Period 43 returned to a lower baseline (40 units). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we must set parameters that account for the expected holiday demand variance. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to balance the recent spike with the lower baseline, effectively forecasting a mean of ~66 units per period (330 over L+1). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility introduced by the Black Friday spike, which is critical for maintaining service levels during the high-volume December weeks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike December volatility confirmed: Period 42 spike (208) followed by Period 43 drop (40). High variance expected to continue through end of year.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand history shows significant recent volatility: a Black Friday spike (P42=208) followed by a sharp drop (P43=40, P44=43). Historically (P32-34), we saw an autumn seasonal peak averaging ~105 units. While the current average (P35-P44) is ~62.5 units, we must account for potential late-December/Christmas demand or post-holiday clearance. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 10 units on-hand and high recent variance, the OR backend needs parameters that maintain a safety buffer without over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (P47). I will use a window of the last 13 periods (P32-P44) for mu_hat (average ~78 units) to capture both the seasonal highs and the baseline lows, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for December's risk.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, following a pre-Christmas spike (P45 demand = 181). We are in a high-volatility period with on-hand inventory exhausted (0 units) and a large pipeline (527 units). Historical data and carry-over insights indicate three distinct regimes: a long-term mean of ~111, a softened baseline of ~61, and recent holiday volatility (P42: 208, P43: 40, P44: 43, P45: 181). To account for the holiday season (last 4 weeks average ~118), I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this seasonal behavior while avoiding the over-weighting of the single 208 spike. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at a higher value (60) to account for the extreme variance observed in Dec (40 to 181). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent conclusions (P40 order arrived P44). This configuration helps the OR backend maintain a higher base stock to recover from the stockout during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: December seasonal volatility confirmed: Demand fluctuates between ~40 and ~200 units (P42-P45), averaging ~118 units/period, significantly higher than the autumn baseline (~61).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the after-Christmas/New Year period (2019/12/30). Historically, Period 42 (Black Friday) saw a spike to 208, followed by a volatile December with spikes of 181 and 155 (likely Christmas/Boxing Day demand). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is ~125 units, which is a significant increase from the autumn baseline (~55-60) and aligns with the 'everyday basics' category seeing seasonal peaks in late Q4. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 42 order in Period 46. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to recent high demand. We need to maintain a higher base stock to cover the continued high variance and the end-of-year seasonal regime. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility December regime.

Carry-over insight: December seasonal volatility confirmed: Demand for P42-P46 averaged 125.4 units (stdev ~74), indicating a return to or exceedance of early-year demand levels (~111).
