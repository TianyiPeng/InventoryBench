Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data shows a significant demand spike on 2019-02-04 (154 units), compared to the previous four weeks which averaged ~63 units. This spike likely corresponds to the lead-up to Valentine's Day or a mid-February seasonal transition for 'Push Up Jeggings'. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, we must cover demand for the current period plus the four periods it takes for an order placed now to arrive (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the most recent 3 samples to capture the upward trend in demand (averaging 99.6 per period) to calculate mu_hat, while using all available samples for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility increase.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a seasonal fashion item (stretch denim jeggings). Last week (Period 1, 2019/2/11), demand spiked to 177 units, likely driven by the lead-up to Valentine's Day or early Spring shopping. This is a significant jump from the historical average (approx. 80 units). The first order of 169 units is in transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods, meaning we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and can satisfy no demand until arrivals begin. My strategy is to adjust mu_hat to reflect this new high-demand regime (recent_N=1, but mu_hat uses N samples across lead time). Since we have 5 historical samples plus the Period 1 observation, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent upward trend starting in early Feb (sample 154 and observation 177).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected in February: demand increased from an average of ~60 to 150+ units starting Feb 4th.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product (Push Up Jegging) entered a significant demand regime shift in early February, with demand leaping from ~60 to ~164 units (average of the last 3 periods: 154, 177, 162). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand = 0) because our initial inventory was insufficient to meet this sudden surge. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders placed in Period 1 (2019-02-11) are expected to arrive in Period 5. Total in-transit is 391 (169 from P1 + 222 from P2). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new demand level of ~164 per period, and use explicit L = 4 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the full lead time duration. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this high-demand regime.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: Jan avg was ~63, while the last 4 periods (including recent samples) show 154, 177, 162, and 91. The average of these last 4 is 146. The drop to 91 in Period 3 might be a fluctuations or a slight cooling after a spike, but it remains significantly higher than the January baseline. On-hand remains 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods; the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the current Period 4 and will be visible in the next status update. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since no arrivals have occurred yet to confirm the actual lead time, I will maintain the default lead time setting (promised L=4).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a seasonal fashion item ('Ladies Denim Jegging'). Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since our first order was placed in Period 1, we expect it to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because all orders since Period 1 are still in-transit (Total in-transit: 784). Historical demand data and recent observations show a clear regime shift beginning Feb 4th. The previous average was ~63, but since Feb 4th (Period 1-4), demand has averaged (177+162+91+116)/4 = 136.5 units. The spike to 177/162 suggests a seasonal peak or promo, followed by a slight cooling to 91/116. Given the promised lead time L=4, we must cover 1+L=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this 'February/March' regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time, I will stick to 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). Looking at the history, the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds. We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in February. The demand sequence from the context and game history is: 54, 53, 67, 78, 154 (pre-game), then 177, 162, 91, 116, 85. Average demand over the last 5 game periods is ~126.2 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 84, but we have 661 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the variability (demand peaked at 177 and dropped to 85), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, ensuring the inventory pipeline covers approximately 126 units/period for the next 5 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a 'Push Up Jegging' (Ladies Denim). Historical demand analysis shows a significant spike in early February (reached 154-177 units), which has since stabilized into a lower, more consistent range (approx. 85-116 units over the last 4 periods). The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5; Period 2 order arrived in Period 6). On-hand inventory is 204, and in-transit inventory is 478 (orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6), totaling 682 units. Given the recent stabilization of demand, I will use a window of 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike baseline (approx. 98.5 units/period) rather than the volatile early Feb data. L is set to default as the 4-period lead time is performing as expected.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-Feb spike: Avg demand from Period 3-6 is ~99 units/period, significantly lower than the ~165 seen in Period 1-2. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/01. Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift. After an initial spike in early February (Periods 1-2, avg ~170), demand has stabilized significantly between Period 3 and Period 7, averaging approximately 98.2 units per period (91, 116, 85, 102, 97). Promised lead time is 4 periods, and actual lead time observations from Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirm it is exactly 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Pipeline inventory (orders from P4, P5, P6) is 294 units, and on-hand inventory is 291. Total inventory position (585) is quite high relative to the recent demand mean (~98). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use the last 5 periods (Periods 3-7) to define the current demand regime (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This captures the stabilized post-spike behavior.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. Inventory is high (386 on-hand) due to large orders placed during the February demand peak (avg ~170) arriving now, while current demand has stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, demand from Period 3 onwards (Feb 25 - Apr 1) has averaged 100.8 units per week (91, 116, 85, 102, 97, 114). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 all confirmed L=4). With 386 units on-hand and 85 in-transit (ordered Period 5), we are overstocked relative to current demand. The OR backend will likely order 0 units given the on-hand inventory covers nearly 4 periods of demand alone. I will use recent_N=6 for demand properties to reflect the stable post-February period (mean ~101, std ~12) and use the calculated lead time which is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand (Feb 25 - Apr 1) stabilized: Avg demand = 101 units/period (std ~12). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand analysis shows a high-volume spike in early February followed by a stable period. Over the last 7 periods (since Feb 25), demand has averaged 98.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (orders from Periods 1-5 all arrived with L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 347 and in-transit is 118 (orders from Periods 6, 9). With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. 5 * ~99 units = 495 units. The current total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 465 (347 + 118). This suggests we are slightly below the target base stock level for the current stable demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this post-spike stability and ignore the initial outliers. Lead time remains 'default' (4).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for the 'Push Up Jegging' has transitioned from a high start-of-season peak in early February (avg ~165) to a stable mid-season regime (approx. 100 units/period). However, the last period (Period 10, Apr 15) saw a drop to 60 units. While one data point is not a regime shift, I will use recent_N=6 to capture this softening demand trend without overreacting wildly. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the last 6 observations. On-hand inventory (326) plus in-transit (154) totals 480 units. With lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 (5) periods. At an average demand of ~95, 5 periods of cover is 475 units. We are currently well-stocked, so the OR backend should trigger minimal or zero ordering. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 balances the recent stability with the newest lower sample.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant decline from the post-spike levels. In the last three periods (April 8 - April 22), demand has dropped sequentially (85, 60, 44), averaging ~63 units, compared to the previously stabilized avg of ~100. This suggests a seasonal winding down for this specific jegging SKU. On-hand inventory is healthy at 282, but we have 195 units in transit (expected arrivals from Period 9-11 orders). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on history. To prevent overstocking during this apparent downward trend, I am switching \u03bc\u0302 to a recent_N strategy (N=4) to capture the lower April demand levels (avg ~68). Lead time (L) is set to calculate to use the stable historical average, and \u03c3\u0302 uses recent_N=4 to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward observed in April (P9-P11): mean demand dropped from ~100 to ~63 units/period (-37% shift).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th. Historically, this SKU (Push Up Jegging) saw a high-demand regime in February (~165 units), followed by a standard period (~100 units), and is now in a lower-demand April/May regime. Demand in the most recent 4 periods (P9-P12) has averaged 72.25 units (85, 60, 44, 100), though Period 12 showed a bounce-back to 100. Despite the P12 spike, the overall trend since mid-April is lower than the February/March levels. Inventory is currently healthy with 182 on-hand and 210 in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12). The lead time is stable at 4 periods as observed in the concluding messages for P5-P10. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current lower demand regime while accounting for the recent uptick in P12. This will set a base stock level that covers the 5 periods (L+1) without over-ordering during a potential seasonal cooldown.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1159.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Evaluation of the demand history shows a distinct downward shift starting in April. The 'Post-spike' average from Period 3-9 was approximately 101 units, but recent demand from Period 10-13 has dropped to an average of 68.75 units (60, 44, 100, 71). The product (Push Up Jegging) is a staple denim item which likely saw a peak during the early spring transition and is now settling into a lower early-summer baseline. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 190 and in-transit at 193, we have roughly 383 units available to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). Given the current demand average of ~69, 5 * 69 = 345 units, suggesting we are well-stocked. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this lower demand regime (last 4 periods of available conclude data) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, and 'calculate' for lead time as it remains consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward further confirmed (May 13): Avg demand for Period 10-13 is 68.75 units, a significantly lower baseline compared to the 100+ units seen in March.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 658030001 (Push Up Jeggings) shows a clear downward shift in April/May compared to the February/March peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 65.8 units/period (60, 44, 100, 71, 54), while the average for the last 3 periods (P12-P14) is 75 units/period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of orders from P9 and P10. With a promised lead time of 4, the order cycle covers L+1=5 periods. On-hand inventory is 211, and in-transit is 166 (from P11, P12, P13, P14), totaling 377 units of pipeline stock. Given the current average demand of ~66-70 units, the current stock covers over 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use default for L as it matches the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. This is a low-waist skinny denim item. Recent demand (last 6 periods, P10-P15) shows a mean of 70.0 units with a standard deviation of 22.1. This represents a sustained lower demand regime compared to the February/March peak of ~100+ units. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods (P11 arrived in P15). We have 161 units on hand and 156 in transit (P12: 15, P13: 62, P14: 48, P15: 31). The pipeline + on-hand (317) is sufficient for more than 4 periods of demand at the current rate (70 * 4 = 280). I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized lower demand levels of late spring, ensuring we don't over-order against high holding costs as we move further away from early year peaks.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Push Up Jegging' (denim trousers) in June. Demand has stabilized into a lower-volume regime after the February/March peak. For the last 7 periods (P10-P16), the demand mean is approximately 68.7 units (60, 44, 100, 71, 54, 91, 62). There are no new calendar events or seasonality shifts expected in early June for this staple item. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P12 order arrived in P16). I am choosing N=7 for mu_hat to capture this recent stable baseline while smoothing out the volatility observed in the last 7 weeks. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same N=7 to reflect current variance. On-hand + In-transit is 361 units, which is ample for approximately 5.2 periods of demand at the current rate (~69/unit), suggesting the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to reduce holding costs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030001 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) is exhibiting a sustained lower demand regime compared to the early-year spikes. On June 10th, we are well past the February/March season. Demand for the last 8 periods (Periods 10-17) has averaged approximately 65.6 units/period (60, 44, 100, 71, 54, 91, 62, 43), with a standard deviation of roughly 21. This confirms the downward shift noted in previous carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival from Period 13 in Period 17). With 133 units on hand and 243 units in-transit (orders from P14, P15, P16, P17 are expected to arrive in P18, P19, P20, P21 respectively), the current pipeline is healthy relative to the current mean demand. To reflect this stable, lower demand regime, I will use recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-April behavior. Lead time estimation will use 'calculate' as it has been stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $759.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030001' (Push Up Jeggings) is currently experiencing a sustained lower demand regime that began around mid-April (Period 10). In the most recent 5 periods (P14-P18), the mean demand has stabilized at 47.4 units/period (values: 54, 91, 62, 43, 47), which is a significant drop from the ~100 units/period seen in March. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 13 through 18. Currently, the on-hand inventory (134) plus in-transit stock (224) totaling 358 units is sufficient to cover approximately 7.5 periods of demand at the current rate (358 / 47.4). I will use a window of N=5 to capture this current demand regime (mu_hat calculation) and N=7 for sigma_hat to account for slightly more volatility seen in late May. L is set to calculated as lead times have been perfectly consistent at 4 periods. This approach will likely lead the OR backend to place small or zero orders this period to bleed off the excess on-hand inventory relative to the lower demand, minimizing holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level (approx. 47 units/period) for the period range P14-P18, confirming the downward shift noted in P14.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 658030001 (Ladies Denim Jegging) has experienced a significant downward shift and stabilization. Since Period 14 (mid-May), weekly demand has averaged approximately 52 units, compared to much higher levels in early Spring. The last six periods (P14-P19) show demand sequence: 54, 91, 62, 43, 47, 46. Excluding the P15 outlier (91), the mean is 48.4. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods (L=4). With on-hand inventory at 119 and in-transit at 213, the pipeline is relatively healthy given the lower demand regime. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while the item moves into the summer season, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture this lower stable demand regime (approx 5*48 = 240 units for mu_hat). I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Analysis of recent demand from Period 14 to Period 20 (mid-May through late June) shows a stabilized lower demand regime, averaging 48.3 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 20) was particularly low at 15 units, possibly due to summer seasonality for denim or a reporting fluctuation. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 16 order in Period 20. On-hand inventory is currently high (210 units) relative to the recent demand mean, providing approximately 4 periods of coverage even without the 127 units currently in-transit. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level (implied q = 0.95), I will use the recent 7-period demand history (Period 14-20) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting this sustained lower-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further at a lower level (~48 units/period) during June (P17-P20), down from the ~68 units seen in early May.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' (5-pocket jeggings) has shown a sustained downward trend through the transition into summer, consistent with seasonal denim wearing patterns. Since Period 17 (early June), weekly demand has averaged approximately 37 units (P17: 43, P18: 47, P19: 46, P20: 15, P21: 34), which is significantly lower than the previous regimes. On-hand inventory (234) plus in-transit stock (72) total 306 units, which is extremely high (roughly 8 weeks of coverage at current demand levels). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent low-demand regime and prevent over-stocking. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' message (Period 21), so I will maintain the default promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower summer level (~37 units/period) during P17-P21, down from the ~48 units seen in early June.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has continued to stabilize at a lower summer level, consistent with seasonal trends for denim jeggings. Over the last 6 periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged 37.0 units per period (43, 47, 46, 15, 34, 37). The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. My calculation for (L+1) demand coverage is based on the recent 6-period regime (37.0 * 5 = 185 units). On-hand inventory is currently high at 226 units, with 43 units in-transit (orders from P19-P21), creating a total pipeline of 269 units. This significantly exceeds the required base stock for the current demand level. Therefore, I will continue to target the lower demand regime using recent_N (N=6) to minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level, which will likely result in zero new orders this period until the surplus is cleared.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has stabilized at a lower summer baseline. Analyzing the most recent period range (P17-P23), the average weekly demand is approximately 33 units (34, 37, 34, 15, 46, 47, 43). This confirms the downward trend noted in previous carry-over insights. Currently, there is significant excess inventory (on-hand: 212 units) relative to this demand level, covering over 6 weeks of sales. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent conclusions (P19-P23 orders). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this stabilized summer demand (33 units/period), setting mu_hat = (1+4) * 33 = 165. Given the high on-hand inventory vs. the calculation, the OR backend will likely place a zero order, which is optimal for reducing holding costs while maintaining a high service level from existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower summer level for P17-P23, averaging approx. 33 units/period (down from previous ~47-48).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August. Demand for these 'Low Waist Push Up Jeggings' has continued to decline during the summer months. Recent demand samples show a significant drop: P24 was 14 units and P25 was 17 units. Looking back at the last 5 periods (P21-P25), the average demand is approximately 23.2 units, a further decrease from the ~33 units level previously captured. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as confirmed by the P21 order arriving in P25. With 204 units on-hand and 144 units in-transit, we are heavily overstocked for the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower summer floor (~23 units/period) and wait for the overstock to clear before placing significant new orders. The backend capped policy will manage the order flow while I adjust the parameters to match current lower requirements.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward further confirmed in late July: avg demand for P21-P25 is 23.2 units/period, down from the previous ~33 units baseline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030001 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) is experiencing a period of high demand volatility within a broader downward summer trend. In Period 26, demand spiked to 100 units, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average of ~23 units. This spike (Aug 5th) may represent a 'Back to School' peak or a clearance event. On-hand inventory is 104 units, and in-transit is 144 units (mostly from a large Period 25 order). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the observed lead time remaining consistent at 4 periods, I will set L to 'default'. For demand (mu_hat), the recent spike to 100 units contradicts the multi-week downward trend; I'll use a larger N (recent_N: 10) to balance the long-term low-demand trend with the recent surge, preventing over-correction while maintaining safety stock. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N: 10 to capture this increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility in early August: Period 26 saw 100 units, breaking a 5-week trend of ~23 units/period. Monitor for 'Back to School' seasonality.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030001' (Push Up Jegging) is currently experiencing a significant demand surge likely tied to 'Back to School' seasonality in mid-August. Demand spiked from a summer average of ~23 units to 100 in Period 26 and 166 in Period 27. Consequently, the inventory has been depleted (On-hand: 0). The pipeline (In-transit: 182) consists of orders from P25 (144) and P27 (38). Under a 4-period lead time, the 144 units from P25 should arrive during Period 29 (visible in P30), leaving P28 and P29 at high stockout risk if demand remains at these current elevated levels (avg of last 2 samples = 133). Using mu_hat recent_N=2 to capture the sudden spike and sigma_hat recent_N=5 to account for the transition volatility. Lead time 'calculate' is used as actual lead times remain consistently around 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back to School seasonality confirmed: Demand surged from ~23 units/period (P21-25) to avg ~133 units/period (P26-27), representing a 5x increase. Expect high demand to persist through August.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the midst of a 'Back to School' seasonal peak for SKU 658030001 (5-pocket jeggings). Demand has surged from a July baseline of ~23 units/period to an average of ~133 units/period over the last three periods (P26: 100, P27: 166, P28: 133). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales, while 424 units are in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the product category (Ladies Denim Trousers) and the date (late August), I expect this high demand to persist or potentially increase as school seasons fully commence. I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this 133 units/period mean. I am using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (std ~33) observed during this surge, ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to recover from the current stockout and satisfy the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Back to School seasonality confirmed: Demand surged from ~23 units/period (P21-25) to avg ~133 units/period (P26-28), representing a 5x increase sustained for 3 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030001' (Push Up Jeggings) is currently experiencing a confirmed 'Back to School' seasonal surge. Demand over the last four weeks has been [100, 166, 133, 105], averaging 126 units/period, compared to the summer baseline of ~23 units. Current on-hand inventory is low (39 units), while in-transit inventory is high (469 units), including large orders placed in Periods 28 and 29 to cover this surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend will naturally aim for a high service level. To sustain this seasonal demand forecast, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime specifically. For lead time, I'll use 'calculate' to reflect the consistent 4-period observations.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand 'Back to School' phase which began around Period 26 (early August). Historically, demand surged from ~23 units to an average of ~134 units over the last 5 periods (P26-P30: 100, 166, 133, 105, 167). The current stockout (on-hand = 0) is due to this rapid pivot. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P25 order arriving in P29). Since this is a seasonal peak, I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-velocity regime while ignoring the low summer demand periods. This will maintain a high base stock to satisfy the current trend and rebuild inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Back to School seasonality peak sustained: mean demand for P26-P30 is 134.2 units/period, compared to the summer baseline of ~23-33 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030001' (Push Up Jegging) is currently experiencing 'Back to School' seasonality, which began around Period 26 (early August). Historically, this peak has sustained for 6 periods (P26-P31) with an average demand of 141.5 units/period (100, 166, 133, 105, 167, 178). Specifically, the last three weeks (P29-P31) show a rising trend (105, 167, 178), suggesting the peak may still be active or just starting to plateau as we enter mid-September. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large in-transit pipeline of 751 units. However, we have experienced stockouts in P27, P28, P30, and P31, meaning actual demand is likely higher than sales. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the full seasonality regime (approx 141 units/period), and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to account for the high volatility observed during this peak (std ~30). This ensures the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) period demand adequately.

Carry-over insight: Back to School seasonality peak sustained through P31: average demand P26-P31 is 141.5 units/period, with a significant volatility increase compared to summer baseline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in the 'Back to School' peak demand regime, which began around Period 26 (early August). Historically, this peak has sustained an average demand of approximately 141.5 units per period over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), with high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 31). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 28 order in Period 32. Current on-hand inventory is 104 units, and we have 590 units in-transit (orders from P29, P30, P31, and P32). Since 'Back to School' demand usually begins to taper off in late September/early October for apparel, but remains high through September, I will maintain the current forecast using the most recent 7 samples (N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the seasonal peak while preventing excessive over-ordering as the season potentially shifts. This covers the (L+1)=5 period pipeline requirement.

Carry-over insight: Back to School seasonality peak sustained: mean demand for P26-P32 is 141.1 units/period with sigma ~30. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. We are at the tail end of the high-demand 'Back to School' season for this 5-pocket jegging SKU. Historical demand for the last 8 periods (P26-P33) has averaged 150 units/period (100, 166, 133, 105, 167, 178, 138, 213), significantly higher than the summer baseline of ~23-33 units. The most recent demand (P33) was 213, indicating the peak is still active or slightly expanding. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 80 and a large pipeline of 526, we must maintain a high base stock to cover demand over the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this entire high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this period range aligns precisely with the start of the seasonal shift in August.

Carry-over insight: Back to School seasonality peak intensified in September: average demand for P26-P33 is 150.0 units/period, up from the 141.1 avg observed through P32.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030001 (Push Up Jegging) is currently experiencing 'Back to School' and early autumn seasonality. Demand shifted upward significantly in early August (Period 26). I am identifying a sustained high-demand regime from Period 26 to Period 34. The average demand over these last 9 periods is approximately 147.0 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 35.8. Recent demand (Period 33: 213 units) suggests the peak may still be active or transitioning into autumnal shopping patterns. I will use recent_N (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume period specifically, as older data from the summer (averaging ~23-33 units) would severely underestimate current needs. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple recent arrivals (Periods 29, 31, 32, 33, 34); therefore, I will continue to use the calculate method which remains stable at 4. The current pipeline (In-transit: 563) plus on-hand (133) is 696 units, which roughly covers 4.7 periods of demand at the current 147 units/period rate, which is appropriate for a 4-period lead time environment.

Carry-over insight: Back to School/Autumn high-demand regime confirmed for P26-P34: mean demand is 147.0 units/period (std ~36), a significant increase from summer levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th. We are in a high-demand regime that began with the 'Back to School' peak in August and has persisted through September and early October. While the most recent demand (91 units in P35) is lower than the peak average (~150), it is consistent with the sustained volatility of the current Autumn season for 'Ladies Denim'. Historical lead times are stable at 4 periods. Since P26, mean demand has been significantly higher than the summer baseline. To capture this shift while allowing for recent variability, I will use a N=10 window for mu_hat (covering the entire high-demand regime P26-P35) and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for approximately 150 units/period (multiplied by L+1) to prevent the stockouts seen in August/September. On-hand + In-transit (186 + 594 = 780) covers roughly 5-6 weeks of recent average demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P26-P35) remains active: mean demand is 141.4 units/period (std ~38), significantly higher than the summer baseline of ~30. Volatility remains elevated.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1133.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant 'Back to School' peak starting in August (P26), which peaked around P33 (213 units) and has since shown a downward cooling trend in October: P34 (123), P35 (91), and P36 (70). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 127 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P34-P36) average only 94.7 units, indicating the seasonal peak is subsiding. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend targets a high service level. To prevent overstocking as demand cools while still covering potential volatility, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers the peak-to-trough transition, result ~635 units for L+1), and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the higher volatility seen during the entire autumn regime. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' based on consistent historical performance of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend observed in October: Demand dropped from a peak of 213 (P33) to 70 (P36), signaling the end of the high-intensity Back to School/Autumn surge.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 658030001 (Push Up Jeggings) is entering a cooling phase following the 'Back to School'/Autumn peak. In Period 37, demand was 73 units, and the preceding period was 70. This confirms a significant drop from the September peak (mean ~150). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P35-P37) is 78 units, compared to the P26-P34 average of 147 units. Given the transition into late October/November, demand is expected to stabilize at this lower post-peak level. Inventory is currently healthy with 249 units on-hand and 473 in-transit (P34 order of 213 is expected to arrive next period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend and lower volatility, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the high-demand summer/autumn history.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Avg demand for P36-P37 is ~71.5 units, down ~50% from the Autumn peak (P26-P35 mean ~141).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 658030001 has entered a cooling phase following the 'Back to School' peak. The average demand for the last three periods (P36-P38) is 72.3 units, compared to the peak average (P26-P35) of ~141 units. Current on-hand inventory (388) plus in-transit stock (260) totals 648 units, which is significantly high given the new lower demand level. At ~72 units/period, we have approximately 9 periods of stock available, which exceeds the required coverage for the lead time (L=4 + 1 = 5 periods). Therefore, the OR backend will likely order 0 units this period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent cooling trend and stabilize inventory levels against the previous high-volatility peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase stabilized: Avg demand for P36-P38 is 72.3 units/period (std ~2.1), a ~50% reduction from the Autumn peak (P26-P35).

Daily Reward (R_t): $777.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU has clearly stabilized into a lower post-seasonal regime following the 'Back to School' peak. Over the last four periods (P36-P39), demand has consistently ranged between 67 and 74 units, with a mean of 71.0 and a very low standard deviation (~3.2). This is a significant shift from the Autumn peak average of ~141. Current on-hand inventory is 496 units, with 85 units in-transit (ordered P36-P37). Given the current mean demand, the existing stock levels are extremely high, representing approximately 8 periods of supply (496 / 71). The OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally suppress new orders because the current pipeline vastly exceeds the target levels for a lead time of 4. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this new stable demand regime (71 units/period * (4+1) = 355) and use a recent_N sigma_hat to capture the low volatility of this phase, allowing the system to wind down the excess inventory without further ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Autumn peak: Period 36-39 mean demand is 71.0 units/period (std ~3.2), confirming a ~50% reduction from the Sep/Oct high of 141.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The 'Back to School' / Autumn surge (Periods 26-35) has clearly concluded, with demand shifting to a stable post-peak regime. For the last five periods (P36-P40), demand has been incredibly stable, averaging 70 units with very low volatility (P36: 70, P37: 73, P38: 74, P39: 67, P40: 66; mean = 70.0). On-hand inventory is currently very high (501 units) relative to this current demand level due to the arrival of large orders placed during the high-demand peak. In-transit inventory is minimal (14 units from P37), and the promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent. Given the high stock levels (covering ~7 periods of current demand) and the stabilized demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this lower, stable baseline. This will prevent over-ordering while the system works through existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Autumn peak (P36-P40): mean demand is 70.0 units/period with very low volatility (std ~3.5). Expect this baseline to persist until Holiday/Black Friday seasonality potentially impacts late November.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is the week of Black Friday. Historically, we've seen significant 'Back to School' seasonality for these jeggings, but the subsequent cooling phase (P36-P40) saw demand stabilize at ~70 units/period. However, P41 showed a drop to 44 units, suggesting a potential further pre-holiday lull or noise. Given the product category (Ladies Denim Jegging), a surge for Black Friday/Holiday shopping is highly probable, but the lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now will arrive in late December (post-Christmas). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (471 units), and Pipeline is 0. Based on a mean of 70 units/period, we have ~6.7 periods of stock, which covers the (L+1) window even if a moderate holiday spike occurs. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining cover for the current stabilized demand of ~70 units, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6, covering P36-P41) to capture the post-Autumn mean (~67.3 units) and use default sigma. No new order is likely to be triggered by the OR backend due to the high on-hand balance.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2nd, leading into potentially higher holiday demand, although the last several weeks (P36-P42) have shown a stabilized baseline around 63 units/period (mean of P36-P42 = 63.1). The 'Back to School' peak is over. We have 423 units on-hand and 34 in-transit (ordered P42). No orders were placed in P38-P41 because on-hand levels were very high (500+). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (423 units) relative to recent demand (~63), the OR backend will likely not place a large order, which is appropriate to minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (P36-P42) to capture the current stable post-peak regime while monitoring for any late-December holiday spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further in late Oct/Nov (P36-P42): mean demand is 63.1 units/period with std ~12, significantly lower than the Autumn peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th (Period 44). We are post-Autumn peak and recently witnessed a drop in demand to 17 units in Period 43, continuing the cooling trend observed since October. The target SKU is 'Push Up Jegging', which typically sees high 'Back to School' interest (already passed) and potentially a year-end or holiday lift. However, recent demand (P36-P43) has averaged approximately 57.3 units with a significant downward trend in the last two weeks (48 and 17 units). Given the high on-hand inventory (406 units) and low current demand, we are well over-stocked relative to a 5-period window (L=4 + 1 review period). Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 (the stable post-peak period) provides a mean of ~57.3, amounting to a total requirement of roughly 286 units over 5 periods. With 406 on-hand, we do not need to order. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on history.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend intensified in late Nov/early Dec: Period 43 demand dropped to 17 units, the lowest since early August. Prior baseline of ~63 units/period (P36-P42) may be shifting lower towards a winter/holiday trough.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16 (Period 45). We are in a winter/holiday demand regime where demand has significantly cooled from the autumn peak. Over the last 3 periods (P42-P44), demand has been 48, 17, and 27 units, averaging 30.7 units/period. This is a sharp drop from the previous baseline of ~63 units/period observed in P36-P42. On-hand inventory is high at 379 units, which is enough to cover over 10 periods of current demand levels. There are 34 units in-transit (ordered P42), which are expected to arrive in Period 46 (observed in P47). Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low current demand and the fact that we are approaching the end of the simulation (P47), the strategy is to avoid ordering more to minimize holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Parameters are set using the most recent 3-period regime (N=3) to reflect this winter trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed for Dec: Avg demand for P43-P44 dropped to ~22 units/period, down from the late Oct/Nov baseline of ~63 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. The demand regime for December (P43-P45) has significantly cooled, with an average of 19.67 units/period (17, 27, 15), confirming the lower winter baseline projected in the carry-over insights. On-hand inventory is 364 units, with 34 units in-transit (ordered P42, expected to arrive P46). Given the low demand and high on-hand levels, the inventory far exceeds the requirements for the current regime (~20 units/period) plus the 4-period lead time. No new orders are needed. Parameters are set using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this December trough while using the stable lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: December demand trough confirmed for P43-P45: mean demand is 19.7 units/period (std ~6.1), a significant drop from the October/November baseline of ~63.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-78.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the final week of December (Period 47). Demand has stabilized at its lowest level for the year (December trough), with a mean of 18.75 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P43-P46: 17, 27, 15, 16). With 382 units on-hand and an additional shipment potentially arriving from the order in Period 42 (though the 'conclude' message for P46 already shows the P42 order arrived), inventory is significantly higher than required for this demand regime. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19), the target service level is high, but the current inventory of ~380 units covers more than 20 weeks of current demand. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 weeks (N=4) to reflect the December trough and maintain sigma_hat using recent volatility to avoid unnecessary ordering while holding excess stock.

Carry-over insight: January baseline check: Previous year (P1-P4) showed demand starting at ~177 units in February but historical data indicates Jan demand was ~50-80. December trough is sustained at ~19 units/period (P43-P46).
