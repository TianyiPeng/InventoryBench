Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 711440001 (Jersey Wrapover top) showed a significant jump from a baseline of ~11 units to 74 units in the most recent week (2019-02-04), likely due to a seasonal shift or pre-Valentine's Day demand. With on-hand inventory at 0, I need to react to this demand spike while maintaining a safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' where N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this regime shift (averaging the spike with the two previous data points) while avoiding over-reliance on a single outlier. Lead time is set to default (4 periods) as no historical arrival data is yet available to suggest deviation from the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand jumped from ~11 to 74 on 2019-02-04, suggesting a potential seasonal increase for this 'Jersey Fancy' item.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 18, 2019. The product (Womens Jersey Fancy wrapover top) saw a major demand spike starting Feb 4 (demand jumped from ~11 to 74, then 98 in Period 1), likely due to early spring/Valentine's Day seasonal demand. My previous order of 92 units is in-transit and not expected for several more periods (promised L=4). On-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. Demand for the most recent two periods (74 and 98) averages 86. To cover the lead time (L=4) plus current period (total 5 periods) at this new demand level, I need to adjust mu_hat. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to focus on this new high-demand regime, as it represents a clear departure from Jan patterns. I will use 'default' for L and sigma_hat as there is not yet enough data to confirm lead time drift or a stable new standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed: Feb demand average is 86 units/period (compared to Jan average of 10.75), representing a sustained seasonal shift for this sweater/top.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand has stabilized at a high level (98 and 107 in the last two periods), confirming the earlier seasonal shift (Jan avg ~11, Feb avg ~103). The product is a 'Jersey Fancy' wrapover top, likely a spring seasonal item. Lead time is promised at 4 periods; orders placed in Period 0 (if any), 1, and 2 are currently in transit. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 244 in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, the first major order from Period 1 (92 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5. To address the confirmed demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=3 (capturing the start of the jump at 74 and the two subsequent ~100+ demand points) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine uses the current high demand profile (~93 avg) rather than the Jan baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~100 units/period (avg of Periods 1-2 is 102.5), confirming sustainability of the Feb seasonal spike.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). Since Period 1 (Feb 4th), demand for this 'Jersey Fancy' wrapover top has shifted from ~11 units to a stabilized high-demand regime averaging ~95 units (98, 107, 81 in the last three periods). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, following three periods of lost sales due to lead time. Total in-transit is 366 units (92+152+122). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, the first order (92 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (next period) and be visible at the start of Period 6. Consequently, we expect to be out of stock for one more period. I will maintain mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (the high-demand regime) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to satisfy the current seasonal trend once stock arrives. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the variance across the whole history, which currently weights the recent spike heavily.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Jersey Fancy' wrapover top. Historical demand shifted from ~11 units (January) to an average of ~88 units since early February (98, 107, 81, 67). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have placed orders in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4, we expect the first order (92 units) to arrive during Period 5 (today) because 1 + 4 = 5. Per the game mechanism, this arrival will resolve after the decision phase and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible at Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 528 units in-transit (92+152+122+162). Our goal is to maintain a base stock that covers demand for the (L+1) = 5 period window. Using the recent 4 periods since the regime shift (Feb 11 - Mar 4), the mean demand is 88.25. To avoid over-ordering while awaiting the first arrival, I will use recent_N with N=5 (including the 74 from Feb 4) to stabilize the mu_hat forecast around this new higher regime (~85-90 per period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in the high tier (average ~88 units/period) for the fifth consecutive week, confirming a seasonal plateau rather than a single peak.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Jersey Fancy' wrapover top, which experienced a significant demand shift starting in early February. The average demand since the shift (Feb 4th to present) is approximately 83 units per week (74, 98, 107, 81, 67, 44), though the most recent two weeks show a softening (67 and 44). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived exactly on time in Period 5 (L=4), confirming the promised lead time. Inventory is now being satisfied (on-hand 48), but because the system was stocking out for 4 periods, 'sold' units were zero despite high demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the high-demand regime since Feb 4th for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the default lead time of 4. This ensures our base stock (covering ~5 weeks of demand) accounts for the current regime (~83 units/week) while the OR backend manages the pipeline of 436 units already in transit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 5). Current demand regime (Feb-Mar) average is ~83 units/period, showing a slight downward trend in the last 2 weeks.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The item is a 'Jersey Fancy' wrapover top, which saw a demand spike starting in February. Historical demand since the jump (Period 1-6) is: 98, 107, 81, 67, 44, 55. While the initial February spike was high (avg ~95), demand in the last three weeks (Periods 4-6) has cooled to an average of 55 units. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in Period 5 and 6 arrivals). On-hand inventory is 145, and we have a large pipeline of 284 units (ordered in Periods 3 and 4) arriving in Periods 7 and 8. The OR backend needs to account for the current demand level; I will use N=3 to capture the most recent cooling trend (avg 55) to avoid over-ordering, while the sigma_hat will use N=6 to capture the volatility of the entire high-demand regime since February.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend: The initial February surge (~95 units/period) has moderated to a stable level of ~55 units/period over the last 3 weeks (Periods 4-6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product 'Jersey Fancy Wrapover top' experienced a significant demand spike in February (avg ~102/period), but has stabilized and cooled throughout March. The demand for the last three periods (Periods 5, 6, and 7) was 44, 55, and 44 respectively, resulting in a three-period average of 47.7 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (223) due to previous large orders arriving, and there are 162 units still in transit (ordered in Period 4). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. Given the cooling trend and current inventory level (On-hand + In-transit = 385), which covers approximately 8 periods of the current demand rate, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current stabilized demand of ~48 units/period, and use default lead time (4) and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Post-February surge, March demand has stabilized at ~48 units/period (avg of Periods 5-7), significantly lower than the February peak of ~100.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a 'Wrapover top' (Jersey Fancy/Sweater), which experienced a significant demand surge in February (peaking at ~107 units/period) and has since stabilized in March and early April. Historical demand samples for the last four concluded periods (P5-P8) are 44, 55, 44, and 65, averaging 52 units/period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. We currently have 320 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With an average demand of ~52 units and a lead time of 4, the expected demand over (L+1) = 5 periods is approximately 260 units. Since our current inventory (320) exceeds the required base stock for the lead time plus review period, the OR backend will likely place a zero or near-zero order to minimize holding costs while the surplus is consumed. I will set L to 4, mu_hat to 52 * 5 = 260 using recent_N=4 to reflect the current post-surge stability, and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-February surge has stabilized at a lower tier, averaging 52 units/period (Periods 5-8 evidence).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Jersey Fancy Wrapover top) is currently in a post-peak demand phase. After a surge in February (reaching ~100 units/period), demand has stabilized at a lower tier. Over the last five periods (Periods 5-9), the demand sequence has been 44, 55, 44, 65, and 32, resulting in an average of 48 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently high (288 units) due to the large batches ordered during the February peak arriving now (with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods). With no units in-transit and a demand average of ~48, the current stock covers approximately 6 periods of demand (288 / 48 = 6). Since the review period plus lead time (L+1) is 5 periods, we are slightly overstocked but in a safe position. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this stabilized lower demand regime and use the default lead time (4) which matches our observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully stabilized at a lower tier following the February surge; the average for the last 5 weeks (Periods 5-9) is 48 units/period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'Jersey Fancy Wrapover top' experienced a significant demand surge in February (averaging ~100) and has since cooled and stabilized at a lower tier as we move into April. Over the last 6 periods (Periods 5-10), demand has been: 44, 55, 44, 65, 32, 24, averaging 44 units/period. The most recent three periods (P8-P10) show a clear downward drift (65 -> 32 -> 24), suggesting the seasonal peak for this sweater-like garment is ending as warmer weather approaches in late April. Current on-hand inventory is 264 units, which at the recent stabilized average of ~44 units/period, provides approximately 6 weeks of coverage. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods (L+1=5), and arrivals have been consistent with a 4-period lead time, the current inventory is sufficient. No new units are currently in-transit because no orders were placed in periods 5-10 due to high inventory from early-game over-ordering. I will use a N=5 window for mu_hat to capture the post-surge stabilization while allowing the OR backend to react to the recent downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend continued through April; demand for the last 3 periods (P8-P10) averaged 40.3 units, down from the February/March plateau.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a seasonal jersey wrapover top. Demand peaked in February (avg ~100) and has steadily declined through March and April as the spring season progresses. Specifically, the last four periods (P8-P11) have seen demands of 32, 24, 24, and 24, showing a clear stabilization at a lower tier (approx 26 units/period). Inventory currently sits at 240 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a service level target (based on $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), the safety stock requirement is significantly lower than current levels. At a mean demand of ~26 units, the total expected demand over the lead time + review period (5 periods) is roughly 130 units. With 240 units on hand, we are significantly overstocked and should not place any new orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled into a late-spring low-tier regime: the last 3 periods (P9-P11) show a consistent demand of 24-32 units, averaging ~27 units/period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a seasonal jersey wrapover top. Demand experienced a significant surge in February (peaking at ~100 units/period) but has since cooled substantially. Over the last four periods (P9-P12), demand has been consistently low: 32, 24, 24, and 22 units, respectively. The average demand for the last 3 periods is ~22.7 units. We are currently in a high inventory position with 218 units on-hand and zero in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods and the current demand rate, this inventory represents approximately 9-10 weeks of stock, which is far above the required service level coverage for a (L+1) horizon of 5 weeks. Consequently, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (last 4 periods) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation aligns with current market conditions, allowing the excess inventory to bleed down naturally to reduce holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled into a late-spring/early-summer low regime: last 4 periods (P9-P12) average 25.5 units/period, a significant reduction from the earlier February surge.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Jersey Wrapover Top) has exited its peak February/March season and is now in a sustained low-demand regime. Demand has been extremely stable for the last 5 periods (P9-P13), ranging between 22 and 32 units, with an average of approximately 24.8 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 196 units with 0 in-transit. At the current demand rate, 196 units represent approximately 8 periods of supply, which is significantly higher than the (L+1) target of 5 periods (where L=4). Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00), the priority is consuming existing inventory to avoid unnecessary holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this low-demand stability and using default settings for lead time and sigma, which will result in no new orders being placed by the OR backend until the surplus is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully stabilized in a low-demand summer regime: last 5 periods (P9-P13) average 24.8 units/period with very low variance (sigma < 5), confirming the end of the spring cycle.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Jersey Fancy' wrapover top, which saw a major demand peak in February/March (averaging ~85 units/period) but has since cooled significantly. Demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14: 32, 24, 24, 22, 22, 40) averages 27.3 units per period. The recent jump to 40 units in P14 is considered a minor fluctuation within the established low-tier summer regime rather than a new surge. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 156 units with 0 in-transit. Based on the current demand rate of ~27 units/period, the current stock covers over 5 periods of demand (156 / 27 \u2248 5.7). Given the lead time is 4 periods and the OR backend targets a base stock level (1+L periods of coverage), the existing inventory is already sufficient to cover the lead time + current period (L+1=5) without new orders. Ordering more now would only increase holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods to reflect the stabilized low-demand regime and use default lead time mapping.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Jersey Fancy Wrapover top) is in a low-demand summer phase following a peak in February. Demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) has averaged 26.6 units (24, 22, 22, 40, 25). The current on-hand inventory of 131 units is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand at this rate. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and a desired coverage of 5 periods (L+1), the current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the projected base stock requirement (approx 26.6 * 5 = 133, but the OR engine's cap and existing high inventory will result in zero orders). I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current low-demand stability while maintaining the default lead time of 4, as confirmed in previous arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in the low-summer regime; last 5 weeks (P11-P15) average 26.6 units/period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Jersey Fancy' wrapover top has entered a summer low-demand regime. Demand for Period 16 was significantly lower than the previous average, dropping to 9 units. The last 5 periods (P12-P16) show an average demand of 23.6 units/period (22, 22, 40, 25, 9). Currently, there are 122 units on hand and 17 units in transit (expected to arrive in P20). Total pipeline inventory is 139 units. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Based on the recent 5-period average, the expected demand over (L+1) is approximately 118 units. Since our current total inventory (139) exceeds this, the OR backend will correctly logic into placing no new orders. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent demand regime (last 5 periods) and maintain the lead time at 4, as historical arrivals (P5-P8) consistently confirmed a 4-period lead time.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Jersey Fancy wrapover top) is currently in a low-demand summer regime. Historical demand for the most recent 5-week period (P13-P17) averages 22.2 units per period (40, 25, 9, 15, and the current state P17 conclusion of 15). The on-hand inventory is 107 units, which is approximately 4.8 periods of supply at current demand rates. There are 17 units in-transit from P16. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and 1 period for the current decision cycle, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. 5 * 22.2 = 111 units. Our total inventory position (On-hand 107 + In-transit 17 = 124) already exceeds this requirement. I will set parameters to reflect this stabilized low-demand regime to ensure the OR backend maintains a lean inventory and avoids excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the remaining summer weeks. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the P1-P4 ordering and arrival history.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Jersey Fancy Wrapover top) is currently in a stable low-demand summer regime. Historical demand since Period 15 has been 25, 9, 15, and 12 units. The average for the last 3 periods (P16-P18) is 12 units/period, down from the earlier spring average (~25). On-hand inventory is 95 units with 27 units in-transit (orders from P16 and P18), totaling 122 units against a likely demand of ~12 units/period. The lead time L is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning we should aim for a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 periods * 12 units/period = 60 units. Since current inventory (122) significantly exceeds this requirement, the OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly result in zero orders. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent stabilized low-demand regime: L=4 (promised/observed), mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) which capture the most recent cooling to ~12 units/period, and sigma_hat also based on N=3 to account for the reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: demand settled into a lower summer trough averaging ~12 units/period (Periods 16-18), down from the previous ~25 units/period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. This product, a 'Jersey Fancy' wrapover top (long sleeves), has entered a summer trough. Demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) has consistently been low, averaging 12 units per period (9, 15, 12, 12). This represents a distinct and stable downward shift from the previous summer regime of ~25 units. On-hand inventory is currently 83 units, which provides nearly 7 weeks of cover at the current demand rate of 12/week. Additionally, 27 units are in-transit (orders from P16 and P18). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock relative to the current low-demand regime, the goal is to prevent further accumulation of holding costs while maintaining a service level for the (1+L) period horizon (5 periods). I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent N=4 regime (avg 12) to ensure the OR backend recognizes the significant decrease in required base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: Summer trough established with an average of 12 units/period (P16-P19) compared to the previous ~25 units/period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Jersey Fancy' wrapover top, currently in a summer trough. The date is July 1st. In the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has been consistently low, averaging 11.4 units per period (9, 15, 12, 12, 9). This confirms the summer regime shift identified in previous observations. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 16 order in Period 20. On-hand inventory is 91 units, and 10 units are in-transit (due to arrive in Period 22). Total pipeline inventory is 101 units. Given the (L+1) demand coverage requirement and a mean demand of 11.4, the required base stock is approximately 57 units. Since 101 units (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the projected 5-period demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this low-demand summer state and use the default lead time.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'Jersey Fancy Wrapover top' is currently in a low-demand summer trough, with demand for the last five periods (P17-P21) being 15, 12, 12, 9, 8 respectively, averaging 11.2 units per period. This confirms the seasonal downward shift previously noted. On-hand inventory is currently 83 units, with 10 units in-transit (ordered P18, expected arrival around P22/P23). This total inventory of 93 units is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the next (L+1) = 5 periods (approx 56 units) at the current rate. Therefore, the goal is to allow excess inventory to deplete naturally to minimize holding costs. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using a recent window (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime accurately. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough regime (Periods 17-21) confirmed: mean demand has further decreased to ~11.2 units/period (compared to ~25 in May).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Fancy' (a wrapover top) is currently in a deep summer trough. Over the last 4 periods (P19-P22), demand has been consistently low: 12, 9, 8, 4 units, averaging 8.25 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 89 units with 0 in-transit. Given a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target inventory (base stock) covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~8 units/period, the target base stock would be approximately 40-50 units. Since current on-hand (89) significantly exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set L to calculate to maintain alignment with observed lead times (consistently 4), and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime (Periods 16-22). This allows the OR backend to realize that current stock is more than sufficient, avoiding unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough regime (Periods 19-22) demand has further softened, averaging 8.25 units/period compared to the previous ~12. Evidence: last four demands are 12, 9, 8, 4.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Fancy' (711440001) has continued to decline during the summer trough, with recent demand dropping to 4 units/period (Historical: 12, 9, 8, 4, 4). The item currently sits on 85 units of on-hand inventory, which, at the recent average demand of ~7.4 units/period (last 5 weeks), represents over 11 periods of supply. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high mismatch between current inventory and the summer demand regime, no new orders are necessary. I will set parameters to reflect this low-demand state to prevent the OR backend from triggering orders, while maintaining a lean base stock. mu_hat is set to the mean of the most recent 5 periods (roughly 7.4 * 5 = 37) to accurately reflect the current summer run-rate.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough regime (Periods 19-23) has deepened; demand has dropped from ~12 to ~7.4 units/period (latest evidence: 9, 8, 4, 4).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Jersey Fancy/Sweater) is currently in a deep summer trough. On-hand inventory is 80 units, which vastly exceeds the current demand regime. Over the last 6 periods (P19-P24), demand has been extremely low: 12, 9, 8, 4, 4, 5 (averaging 7.0 units/period). With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a service cycle of L+1 = 5 periods, the required base stock is approximately 35-50 units. Since on-hand inventory is already 80, the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly result in 0 units ordered. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect this low-demand regime and prevent unnecessary ordering while holding costs are being incurred.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough regime (Periods 19-24) is sustained with an average demand of 7.0 units/period, down from the previous ~12 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, and the product (a jersey wrapover top) is in a low-demand summer regime. Historical demand for the summer trough (Periods 19-25) has averaged roughly 8.5 units per period, although the most recent period (P25) saw a slight increase to 18 units. On-hand inventory is 62 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the lead time (4 periods) plus a safety period (L+1 = 5 periods) at the current demand rate (8.5 * 5 = 42.5 units). No inventory is currently in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the current low-demand volatility and mean while smoothing out the minor spike in Period 25. No new orders should be triggered by the backend due to the high on-hand stock relative to demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Jersey Fancy Wrapover top) is entering its late-summer/pre-autumn phase (August 12). After a deep summer trough (demand ~4-7 units), we have observed two consecutive weeks of demand growth: 18 units in Period 25 and 30 units in Period 26. This suggests the autumn transition is starting. Historically, this product saw its highest demand in February (>100 units), but we must prepare for a recovery from summer lows. Current on-hand inventory is 32, with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since demand has increased significantly for two periods, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this upward movement while remaining cautious about overstocking too early. Using N=3 (P24-P26) gives a mean demand of ~17.7 units per period, while N=2 (P25-P26) would be 24. N=3 provides a balanced bridge into the potential autumn ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition detected: Summer trough (avg ~7) has ended; demand increased to 18 (P25) and 30 (P26), signaling the start of the autumn build-up.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Jersey Fancy Wrapover top) has exited its summer trough and is now in a rapid autumn demand build-up. Demand has tripled or doubled in each of the last three periods: 18, 30, and most recently 64 (exceeding initial expectations). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have a stockout situation as sold units (32) were less than demand (64). The next arrival is scheduled for Period 31 (P27 order, lead time 4). Given the 'Wrapover top with long sleeves' description and late August date, this is a clear seasonal transition. Demand is currently averaging 37.3 units over the last 3 weeks, but the trend line suggests the next few periods will likely exceed 80-100 units, similar to the February peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the jump, but I'll set sigma_hat to 'explicit' to account for the high volatility during this transition phase and the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand build-up confirmed: Demand increased from 18 to 64 over three periods (P25-P27), resulting in a stockout in P27. This confirms a seasonal shift for the 'Jersey Fancy' long-sleeve item as of August.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'Jersey Fancy' (a wrapover sweater with long sleeves) is entering a clear autumn seasonal build-up. Demand has surged from a summer low (~7) to 64 (P27) and 62 (P28), causing a stockout as on-hand inventory hit zero in P27. The average demand over the last two weeks is 63. To recover and meet this new regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=2) to capture the current high-demand state (~63 units/period). This results in a base stock target covering the (L+1) period cycle. L remains at the promised 4 periods, which is consistent with the historical actual lead times observed. I have 95 units in-transit (ordered P27-P28), but with demand at ~60+ and on-hand at 0, additional orders are necessary to prevent prolonged stockouts during the lead time transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Demand spiked from summer trough (~7) to ~63 units/period (avg P27-P28), reflecting seasonal interest in long-sleeve sweaters starting late August.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Jersey Fancy wrapover top) is in a confirmed autumn seasonal surge. Demand has grown from a summer trough of ~7 units/period to 64, 62, and 67 over the last three periods (P27-P29). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 161 units in transit (expected arrivals in P31, P32, and P33). Given the consistent demand spike in late August and early September, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 3 periods to capture this higher regime (average ~64.3). Sigma_hat is also set reflecting this recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P20, P22). The parameter settings aim to build back inventory to meet this sustained higher demand level while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at ~64 units/period (average P27-P29) as of September, confirmed by three consecutive weeks of high demand following the summer trough.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Fancy' (long-sleeve sweater) has surged significantly as we enter September, hitting 131 units in Period 30, which is double the previous three weeks' average of ~64. This confirms a secondary seasonal spike (Autumn/Winter peak) similar to the February surge. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 230 units in-transit (ordered P27-P30). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, meaning the order from P27 (39 units) is expected to arrive in Period 31, P28 (56 units) in Period 32, etc. Given the 131-unit demand spike, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to an explicit forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will set the base mean at 110 units per period to account for the sustained high demand seen in early September, resulting in a mu_hat of 550 (110 * 5). Sigma is increased to reflect high volatility during regime transitions.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak confirmed: Demand spiked to 131 in Period 30 (Date: 2019/9/2), doubling the late-August average of ~64 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Jersey Fancy wrapover top) is experiencing a powerful autumn/winter seasonal spike as we move into September. Demand has escalated rapidly: 64, 62, 67, 131, and now 164 in Period 31. This is a clear regime shift compared to the August build-up (avg ~64). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 346 units in-transit. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward trajectory, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 2 periods of high demand (131 and 164) to capture this new peak level. Using recent_N=2 for mu_hat yields (1+4) * (131+164)/2 = 737.5. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=2 to reflect the high volatility associated with this spike. This strategy aims to aggressively restock to capture the peak seasonal demand while accounting for the high unit profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: September demand peak confirmed: Demand surged to 131 (P30) and 164 (P31), effectively doubling the late-August regime of ~64 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'Jersey Fancy' (long-sleeve wrapover top) is in the middle of a significant autumn/winter seasonal surge. Demand has jumped from a summer average of ~7 units to over 130-160 units in the last three weeks (P30-P32). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) despite recent arrivals, as demand is significantly outstripping the orders placed during the early stages of the ramp-up. The Lead Time is confirmed as 4 periods (P27 arrived P31, P28 arrived P32). Pipeline inventory (476 units) includes orders from P29-P32. To catch up with the new high-demand regime, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the surge (average of 131, 164, 131 is ~142 units/period). This setting informs the OR backend to target a base stock covering (L+1) periods of this higher demand level while balancing the profit margin ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak intensify: September demand (P30-P32) has stabilized at a high tier of ~142 units/period, compared to the late-August ramp-up of ~64 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Jersey Fancy Wrapover top) has entered a major seasonal demand peak. Period 33 observed a massive demand spike to 293 units, following a high September plateau of ~142. This item is highly seasonal (long sleeves, sweater category), and we are currently entering the October peak. As of Period 34, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 584 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals from orders placed in Periods 30 (69 units), 31 (155 units), 32 (186 units), and 33 (174 units). To address the recent demand acceleration (293 in P33 vs ~140 previous), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (Periods 31-33) which captures the surge to an average of ~196 units/period. Sigma_hat is set to explicit (60) to account for the increasing volatility seen in the jump from 131 to 293. The OR backend will use these values to ensure the base stock (L+1 periods) can meet this heightened demand across the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: September stabilization at ~142 units/period was broken by a massive spike to 293 units (Date 2019/9/23), signaling the start of the deep autumn/winter peak for this long-sleeve jersey item.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Jersey Fancy Wrapover) is experiencing a volatile autumn/winter peak. After a massive spike to 293 units in P33, demand in P34 was 96. This could indicate either a temporary dip or high volatility within a very high demand regime. The average demand for the most recent regime (P30-P34) is 163 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the high profit relative to holding cost (4:1), I am setting mu_hat to cover the (L+1) period demand using the mean of the last 5 periods (N=5). I will use a larger sigma_hat (explicitly set) to account for the high volatility observed (96 to 293 in two weeks) and to avoid stockouts during this critical seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in peak season: Demand fluctuated from 293 (P33) to 96 (P34). Average demand for the current high-demand regime (P30-P34) is 163 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Jersey Fancy' wrapover top with long sleeves, which is currently in its autumn/winter peak season (October). Demand has shown high volatility during this period, with a massive spike to 293 (P33) followed by a cooling to 96 (P34) and 60 (P35). Over the last 6 periods (P30-P35), demand has averaged approximately 145 units/period. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 95, and we have a very healthy pipeline of 808 units (ordered during the high-demand spikes). To avoid over-ordering as demand potentially begins to stabilize or fluctuate further in October, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime average while acknowledging the recent downward variance. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus one period of demand (5 periods total), accounting for the current inventory position.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Jersey Wrapover Top) is in its autumn/winter season. Following the late September peak which reached 293 units, demand has significantly moderated: Period 34 (96), Period 35 (60), and Period 36 (40). This indicates that the primary peak of the autumn surge has passed, and we are entering a lower but still substantial autumn/winter maintenance regime. The current on-hand (241) and in-transit (622) total 863 units. Comparing this to the lead-time confirmed at 4 periods, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With the most recent demand trend (averaging ~65 over the last 3 periods), 863 units covers over 13 periods of demand, suggesting we are currently overstocked. I will set the mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4, including the 293 spike to be safe against volatility) to ensure we don't underorder if demand rebounds slightly, but keep 'L' at default to avoid triggering unnecessary orders while the inventory clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling from autumn peak: After a late-Sept high of 293, demand has trended down (96, 60, 40) over the last three weeks, suggesting a shift from 'peak' to 'stabilized winter' regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Jersey Fancy wrapover top) is currently transitioning out of its extreme September peak (which reached 293 units) into a more stable late-autumn regime. Demand for the last four weeks has been 96, 60, 40, and 63, showing a significant drop from the peak but remaining higher than the summer trough. The average demand over these 4 periods is 64.75 units/period. The current inventory position is high: On-hand is 352 units, and In-transit is 448 units (representing the orders from P34 and P35), for a total pipeline of 800 units. Given the desired base stock calculation (Lead Time + 1 = 5 periods), and a forecast of ~65 units/period, the target inventory is roughly 325 units plus a safety buffer. With 800 units already in the system, we are significantly overstocked. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 260 (calculated as (4+1) * 52) to reflect a conservative estimate (lower than the recent 4-week average but reflective of the continuing cooling trend observed since late September) to prevent further ordering and allow existing stock to be absorbed. The OR backend will see the massive pipeline surplus and place zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Extreme autumn peak has moderated to a stable winter tier averaging ~65 units/period (Periods 34-37 evidence).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The item 'Jersey Fancy' (long-sleeve sweater) has moved through its deep autumn peak (late September) and is now in a stabilized winter regime. Demand in the last four weeks (Periods 35-38) has been 60, 40, 63, and 110. While Period 38 saw a jump to 110, the relative average of this recent regime (Periods 35-38) is approximately 68 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 483, with 207 units in-transit (expected in Period 39 resolution). This total inventory position (690 units) is extremely high relative to the current demand regime (~68/period) and the lead time of 4. Even assuming a standard safety stock, the current inventory covers over 10 periods of demand. To avoid excessive holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods of data to reflect the post-peak winter stabilization, while maintaining L at calculate to monitor for delivery variance. This will naturally result in zero orders until the safety stock level is reached.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Winter demand established with higher variance, averaging ~68 units/period (P35-P38) following the autumn peak moderation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-310.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the 'Jersey Fancy' wrapover top has stabilized into a winter regime following the extreme autumn peak in September (P33). Over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), demand has averaged 69.8 units/period (60, 40, 63, 110, 76), which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 39 suggesting a regime of ~68 units. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 614 units, which is sufficient to cover more than 8 weeks of demand at the current rate (614 / 69.8 \u2248 8.8 periods). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and there is no in-transit inventory, the current stock levels are more than adequate to meet service level requirements while minimizing further holding costs. Therefore, I am setting parameters to maintain this inventory position without placing new orders, using a recent 5-period window to capture the current post-peak stability.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P35-P39) confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~70 units/period (60, 40, 63, 110, 76) following the September/October peak surge.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Womens long-sleeve jersey top) is currently in a stabilized winter regime following the high-demand peaks of September and October. The last five weeks of demand (P36-P40) show observations of 40, 63, 110, 76, and 72, averaging approximately 72 units per period. With current on-hand inventory at 542 units and no units in transit, the inventory position is high, covering approximately 7.5 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we are significantly over the target base stock. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture this stabilized winter regime while allowing for the observed variance (range 40-110). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P36-P40) is stable at an average of ~72 units/period, showing moderate variance compared to the extreme September spikes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Historical data for this 'Jersey Fancy' wrapover top shows a significant seasonal peak in September/October followed by a stabilization in November. The demand over the last three periods (P39-P41) has been 76, 72, and 45 units, indicating a moderating trend as we exit the peak autumn season. The current on-hand inventory is 497 units, while the recent 5-period demand average (P37-P41) is 73.2 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, which equates to roughly 366 units. Since the current on-hand inventory (497) significantly exceeds the projected 5-period demand and no more units are in transit, the OR backend logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) will naturally result in an order of 0. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the consistent 4-period historical performance and use recent_N (N=5) for demand parameters to capture the post-peak stabilization. This ensures we don't over-order during the seasonal wind-down.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling: Late November demand (P39-P41) has moderated to an average of ~64 units/period from the early November/late October average of ~70, signaling the end of the high winter plateau.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Fancy' (long-sleeve sweater) has shown extreme volatility in late November/early December. While Period 41 was low (45), Period 42 spiked back to 148, possibly due to Black Friday or early holiday shopping. My 'winter' demand average of 72 observed in recent periods is now being challenged by higher variance (sigma). On-hand inventory is 349, which at current peak-ish demand of ~100-140 units/period, provides about 2.5-3 periods of coverage. Since the lead time is 4 periods, I remain slightly under-stocked for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent range (45 to 148) which averages ~85 units/period, and increase sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility (recent range of 100+ units) to ensure the service level is maintained during the holiday peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in Period 42 (148 units) following a brief cooling trend, likely reflecting holiday seasonality; the 5-week average (P38-P42) is now 90.2 units/period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Fancy' long-sleeve wrapover top shows significant seasonal variation. We are currently in December (Period 44), where demand has historically stabilized after an extreme September/October peak and subsequent moderate November. The last five periods (P39-P43) show a wide range (26 to 148 units) with an average of ~73 units/period. The spike in P42 (148 units) likely reflects a temporary holiday surge, followed by a sharp drop in P43 (26 units). Given the high inventory on hand (323 units) and the in-transit order of 152 units placed last period (expected arrival P47/P48), the current stock covers nearly 6 periods of average demand. The backend's critical ratio (profit $4 / (profit $4 + holding $1) = 0.80) encourages a decent service level. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers P39-P43) to capture the current winter regime and the recent holiday volatility while avoiding over-ordering due to the high existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand variation detected: Period 42 showed a significant holiday spike (148 units) followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (26 units), confirming continued winter volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-193.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019/12/16), and the product is a 'Wrapover top... with long cuffed sleeves', which is highly seasonal. Historically, this item saw a significant surge in February and again from late August through September. We are currently in the post-holiday December cooling phase. Over the last two periods (P43-P44), demand has dropped sharply and stabilized at 26 units, following a volatile November (averaging ~90 units from P38-P42). With 297 units on hand and 152 in-transit (ordered in P43 and arriving around P47), we are significantly overstocked for the current demand level of ~26 units/period. The pipeline + on-hand inventory (449 units) is sufficient to cover over 17 periods of current demand. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (P40-P44) to capture the cooling trend while acknowledging the high November volatility, ensuring the OR backend does not place additional unnecessary orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: High winter demand (~90 units) has dropped significantly to a stable lower tier of 26 units/period for the last two weeks of December.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-167.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'Jersey Fancy Wrapover top' is currently in a late-December low-demand phase. For the past three consecutive periods (P43-P45), demand has been perfectly stable at 26 units per period, following a significant drop from the higher winter regime (~90 units). Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 271, In-transit: 152), providing over 16 weeks of coverage at current demand levels. There is no immediate risk of stockout. I am setting L to 'calculate' based on consistent historical lead times of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this specific low-demand plateau (26 units) while ignoring the preceding holiday volatility (148 units). This prevents the OR engine from over-ordering due to outdated high-demand signals while maintaining a lean safety stock for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at 26 units/period for three consecutive weeks (P43-P45), signifying a late-December post-holiday low.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Womens Jersey Fancy Sweater) is entering the post-holiday/early-January phase. Historically, demand for this item surged in early February 2019 (Period 1). Currently, demand has dropped significantly from the winter peak, stabilizing at a 'post-holiday low' of approximately 21 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P43-P46: 26, 26, 26, 12). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (259) plus in-transit (152) totals 411 units, which is extremely high (nearly 20 weeks of supply at current rates). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the massive inventory surplus, I will use a restricted mu_hat (N=4) to reflect the current low-demand regime and prevent further ordering until the surplus is cleared. No new orders are expected due to the OR backend's base-stock logic and the high current inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand trough confirmed: Demand for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) averaged 22.5 units/period, down from the 90+ units seen in late November.
