Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Jacket Slim'. Based on the initial demand samples from January to early February (9, 6, 16, 8, 14), the mean demand is approximately 10.6 units per week with a standard deviation of 4.16. The promised lead time is 4 periods. As we are entering mid-February, we are approaching the spring season for women's outdoor denim jackets, which typically sees a rise in demand. However, with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, the priority is to establish a base stock that covers the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand baseline (mean ~10.6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at the promised 'default' of 4 until actual lead times are observed. The OR backend will calculate the order based on a service level of ~95% (Profit $19 / (19+1)).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a 'Jacket Slim' (Womens Outdoor/Denim), and we are in mid-February, transitioning towards spring. In Period 1, we saw a demand of 30 units, but had 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in 0 sales. The pre-game historical demand samples (9, 6, 16, 8, 14) suggest an average of roughly 10.6 units per period, but Period 1's demand of 30 is a significant spike (nearly 3x the previous average), likely due to seasonal demand for light spring jackets. Lead time is promised at 4 periods. My strategy is to adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) upwards to reflect this recent surge while maintaining a conservative lead time estimate until we see actual arrivals. I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 for demand to capture the most recent spike, while keeping L at default and sigma at default as we don't have enough variance data for the new regime yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a Women's Slim Denim Jacket. Demand for the first two periods (30, 55) is significantly higher than the pre-game January average (~11), likely due to the start of the spring season for outdoor apparel. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced 85 units of lost sales. There are 63 units in transit (18 from P1, 45 from P2). With a promised lead time of 4, the P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in P6). To capture the recent demand surge and ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time (L+1=5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to reflect the high February demand. sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the high volatility observed in the recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected in February (avg ~42.5 vs Jan avg ~10.6), coinciding with spring seasonal transition for lightweight outerwear.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a women's denim jacket, which is experiencing a significant seasonal demand surge as we enter spring. Demand in February (Periods 1-3) averaged 48 units per week (30, 55, 59), compared to the January pre-game average of ~10.6. There is currently 0 on-hand inventory and 135 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in P6). Therefore, we are currently experiencing stockouts while waiting for the pipeline to arrive. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=3 to capture the modern high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat reflects the current average of ~48 units/period. For lead time, I will stick to the 'default' promised 4 periods as no orders have arrived yet to prove otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~10.6 to 48.0 (+350%) due to spring seasonality for denim jackets.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/3/11. The product is a women's denim jacket, currently in its peak spring demand season. Historical demand for the last 4 periods (30, 55, 59, 43) averages 46.75 units, confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights compared to January's low single digits. Promised lead time (L) is 4. No orders have arrived yet, which is expected as the first order placed in Period 1 (4-period lead time) should arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline is 209 units. To maintain service level during this high-demand period and avoid stockouts once shipments start arriving, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the high spring demand (avg ~47) and use the calculate method for L to adapt to actual transit times as they emerge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $342.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399061008 (Womens Denim Jacket) is in a high-demand spring regime. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5). We are currently experiencing stockouts due to the initial demand spike and lead time lag. Period 5 demand was 42 units, and the average demand since the February shift (Period 2-5) is approximately 49.75 units. Demand samples starting Feb 11 (Period 1) are: 30, 55, 59, 43, 42. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. With on-hand at 0 and 260 units in-transit (P2: 45, P3: 72, P4: 74, P5: 69), we expect P2's 45 units to arrive in Period 6 (visible in P7), followed by P3's 72 units in Period 7. Setting L=4 (promised) as it currently matches observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). High-demand spring regime sustained for 5 periods with mean ~50 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's denim jacket, currently experiencing its peak spring season. Historical analysis shows a clear regime shift starting Period 1 of the game (Feb 11), with demand increasing from ~10 units to an average of ~49.8 units over the last 6 periods (30, 55, 59, 43, 42, 70). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand=0) due to high demand exceeding early small orders. To capture the full demand while the season lasts, I will use recent_N (N=6) to track the current high-demand regime. This period is the last week of March, typically the height of spring fashion sales; I expect demand to remain elevated but stable. Setting L=4 (promised/confirmed). The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1), which is approximately 250 units, helping to satisfy the current backlog and upcoming spring demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1368.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 1st. In Period 7, we saw a massive demand spike to 272 units, which is a 5x increase over the previous average of ~50. This surge is likely driven by peak 'Spring Season' demand for the denim jacket. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 despite receiving a shipment of 72 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (arrived Period 7 from order Period 3). I need to significantly increase the demand coverage (mu_hat) to account for this new regime. However, given the extreme jump, I will use a mixture of the last 4 periods (Spring regime) but adjust to capture the recent surge. Total demand over periods 4, 5, 6, 7 was 43, 42, 70, 272. Mean = 106.75. Given L=4, my target mu_hat (covering 1+L = 5 periods) should reflect this. I will set mu_hat to (5 * 107) = 535 units and increase sigma_hat to manage the high variance observed in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike detected in late March (Period 7: 272 units) representing a new peak spring regime, likely due to weather transition and seasonal shopping.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/04/08). Historical analysis shows a massive demand surge for this denim jacket starting in Period 7 (March 25), with demand jumping from an average of ~50 to 250+ units (Period 7: 272, Period 8: 253). This aligns with the peak spring shopping season for outdoor apparel. Due to the 4-period lead time, we have been stocking out consistently despite receiving shipments. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P4 arrived in P8). Inventory is currently at 0 on-hand, with 445 units in-transit (P5-P8 orders). Given the clear transition to a high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 2-3 periods of data to capture this shift. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters (covering Periods 6-8) to reflect the 250+ unit demand levels while including the transition. L is set to default (4 periods), so mu_hat will be calculated as (1+4) * average_demand[P6, P7, P8].

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in Period 7/8 confirmed: April demand for denim jackets is significantly higher, moving from ~50/period to ~260/period (+420%).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. We are managing a women's denim jacket, which is in its peak spring season. Historical data shows a clear regime shift starting in Period 7 (late March), with demand jumping from an average of ~50 to a significantly higher range (272, 253, 163). The average demand over the last three periods is 229.33 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (evidenced by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with a large pipeline of 758 units. To maintain service levels during this high-demand April period and account for the (L+1) window (5 periods total), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime while budgeting for the volatility observed (std dev of the last 3 samples is ~58). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current 200+ unit/period trend.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late April (2019-04-22). The product 'Jacket Slim' is a denim jacket, which experienced a massive demand surge starting in late March (Period 7: 272, Period 8: 253, Period 9: 163, Period 10: 169). The mean demand over these last 4 periods is approximately 214 units. Lead time is confirmed as a steady 4 periods (as seen in Period 10 conclude). The current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has consistently outstripped recent arrivals (which were small orders from the pre-surge regime). The pipeline inventory is very high (1072 units) because substantial orders were placed in Periods 8, 9, and 10 to catch up with the new regime. I will set the lead time to the promised 'default' of 4 periods. For \u03bc\u0302, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high-demand April regime (Period 7-10). For \u03c3\u0302, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level. The high 'In-transit' quantity will likely prevent the OR backend from placing a massive new order this period, which is appropriate as the system waits for the Period 8/9/10 orders to arrive starting next period (Period 12).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand shows a massive regime shift starting in late March (Period 7), transitioning from ~50 units/period to an average of ~205 units/period over the last 5 periods (272, 253, 163, 169, 168). This aligns with the peak season for a women's stretch denim jacket as spring weather stabilizes. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because arrivals from lower-volume ordering periods (P1-P7) are insufficient to meet this higher demand regime, resulting in significant lost sales. To rectify this, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand mean (~205) and volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 samples ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high-volume spring demand, while L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Mid-spring demand regime (Period 7-11) stabilized at a mean of ~205 units/period, significantly higher than early March (~50) but lower than the initial spike peak (~260+).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13 (early May). Demand for 'Womens Slim Denim Jackets' is in a high-demand spring regime. Reviewing the last 6 periods (Period 7-12), demand has been: 272, 253, 163, 169, 168, 227. The average across this recent regime is approximately 208.7 units per period. The arrival of 290 units in Period 12 (ordered Period 8) confirms the lead time remains steady at 4 periods. Inventory on-hand is 63, and in-transit is 930 (orders from P9, P10, P11, P12). Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. My target base stock should be around 5 * 208.7 \u2248 1044 units. Currently, on-hand + pipeline = 63 + 930 = 993, which is slightly below the target. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized mid-spring regime (approx 209/period) and 'calculate' for L. This will prompt the OR backend to maintain an appropriate service level for the current demand level.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in mid-May (Period 14). Historical demand for this women's denim jacket peaked in late March/April and has since stabilized. The demand over the last three periods (P11-P13) has been 168, 227, and 141 (average ~178.6). The 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 12 noted a stabilization around 205, but recent data suggests a slight cooling as we move further into May. On-hand inventory is 304, with 776 units in transit. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the product's seasonal nature (spring denim), we expect demand to continue at this level or slightly lower as summer approaches. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized regime (avg ~174/period) and L='calculate' as lead times have consistently been 4 periods. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the (L+1)=5 period exposure window (~870 units) against our total position of ~1080 units, likely resulting in a smaller replenishment order to prevent overstocking as the peak season ends.

Carry-over insight: Slight demand cooling in mid-May: Avg demand Periods 11-13 dropped to ~179 from the Period 7-11 average of ~205.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's denim jacket, which is entering the late spring/early summer phase. Historical demand shows a significant spike in late March/April (~200+ units) followed by a slight cooling in May to an average of ~183 (Periods 11-14: 168, 227, 141, 206). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P10 arrived in P14). On-hand inventory is healthy at 424 units, and there are 450 units in-transit (orders from P11: 207, P12: 15, P13: 228). Note: The OR backend will see 450 in pipeline inventory. Given promised L=4, my base stock target needs to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With demand stabilizing around 180-190, a target of ~950 units is appropriate. My parameters use recent_N=4 to capture the current late-spring demand stabilization while ignoring the initial extreme April spikes, ensuring we don't over-order as summer approaches.

Carry-over insight: Late-spring demand (May) for denim jackets has stabilized at a lower mean (~185) compared to the mid-spring peak (~210+), suggesting a seasonal taper as summer approaches.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. This SKU is a women's denim jacket, which is highly seasonal. Historically, we saw a massive demand spike in late March/April (peaking at 272 units/period) which has since transitioned into a 'stabilized late-spring taper'. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 188.8 units. The most recent demand (P15) was 202 units, showing stability around the 185-190 mark reported in carry-over insights. Lead time is reliably confirmed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals. With 429 units on hand and 438 in transit, the pipeline is healthy. I am setting L=4 (promised) and using N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this specific post-peak stabilization regime (mid-May onwards). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the current volatility within this regime, ensuring the service level is maintained against potential late-season fluctuations.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a women's denim jacket. Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization in the late-spring regime (May average ~205 units/period). However, as we enter June, denim jackets typically face seasonal tapering as summer temperatures rise. Demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has been consistently near 200 (227, 141, 206, 202, 209), with an average of 197. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 235 and 626 units in-transit (reflecting large orders from P13, P15, and P16), the pipeline is well-stocked. We must maintain a base stock to cover 5 periods (L+1). I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (~197 * 5 = 985) and use a slightly lower sigma to reflect the current stability before the potential summer drop-off.

Carry-over insight: Summer transition detected: Demand for denim jackets stabilized around ~200 units/period throughout May (Periods 12-16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2357.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10), we are managing a 'Jacket Slim' (denim jacket), which is a classic spring/early-fall transitional item. Demand patterns show a cooling trend as we move further into June. Demand in the most recent period (P17) was 141, mirroring P13 (141), and continuing a general stabilization/slight decline from the April peak (~205-260). The mean demand over the last 6 periods (P12-P17) is approximately 187.6. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. We have 322 units on hand and 643 units in-transit (orders from P14, P15, P16, P17). Since P14 was a zero-order, the pipeline consists of orders from P15 (195), P16 (203), and P17 (245). To account for the observed seasonal taper (from ~200+ down towards ~140-180), I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current late-spring/early-summer levels (approx 187/period), which provides a base stock (L+1=5 periods) of roughly 935 units. This helps avoid overstocking as we enter the likely slower summer season for denim jackets.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand cooling confirmed in June: Demand dropped to 141 in P17, reflecting a seasonal taper as summer weather reduces interest in denim jackets. Average demand has shifted from ~205 (P7-P11) down to ~185 (P12-P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-June (2019-06-17). The product is a denim jacket, which is highly seasonal. Historically, demand peaked in April/early May and is now tapering off as summer temperatures rise. Demand in the last two periods (P17: 141, P18: 163) suggests a new lower regime compared to the mid-spring average of ~200. I have identified a cooling trend. In Period 18, the expected arrival from Period 14 (order=0) resulted in 'arrived=0', which is consistent with the order history. Pipeline inventory is currently 753 units (orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the seasonal transition into summer, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the cooling demand trend since early May (Periods 15-18) while maintaining the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed throughout June: Avg demand Periods 15-18 dropped to ~179 (P15: 202, P16: 209, P17: 141, P18: 163) from the prior peak of ~205, reflecting seasonal shift away from denim jackets in summer.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are in a clear seasonal taper for denim jackets as summer begins. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 173 units. This is a noticeable drop from the April/early May peak of ~205-210 units. The Period 14 order appears to be lost or significantly delayed (it should have arrived in P18), which caused a dip in inventory, but the arrival of the P15 order in P19 has restored on-hand stock to 202 units. Pipeline inventory is currently 659 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent successful arrivals. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this cooling summer demand trend while ignoring the higher-demand spring peaks. This strategy aims to prevent over-ordering as we move further into the summer season when denim jackets are less popular.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand cooling confirmed: average demand for denim jackets dropped to ~173 units/period (Periods 15-19) from mid-spring peak levels (~205). Shipment from Period 14 is likely lost (exceeded L+1 periods without arrival).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 21 (July 1st), which is the height of summer. The product is a denim jacket, which typically experiences peak demand in spring and a significant decline as summer temperatures rise. The carry-over insights and historical data confirm this: average demand for mid-spring (Periods 7-11) was ~205, dropping to ~185 in late spring (Periods 12-16), and further cooling to ~150 in June (Periods 17-20). The last recorded demand was 138. The shipment from Period 14 (ordered May 13th) is now 7 periods old and significantly past the promised lead time of 4; I am treating it as lost and adjusting the pipeline inventory expectations accordingly. Given the clear downward seasonal trend, I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this cooling regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent completed deliveries (Period 15 and 16 orders arrived in Period 19 and 20).

Carry-over insight: July transition confirmed: June demand average dropped to 148.5 (Periods 17-20), representing a 20% decline from the May average (~185) and 28% from the spring peak (~205). Order from Period 14 is confirmed lost after 7 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early July (2019/7/08). Historically, demand for this denim jacket peaked in April (avg ~205) and has been steadily declining as summer progresses. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P18-P21) is 145 units, continuing the cooling trend from the May average (~185) and the late June average (~148). The shipment from Period 14 is confirmed lost. Current on-hand inventory is 385 units, with 329 in-transit units remaining (from P18, P19, and P20). Total pipeline inventory is 714 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the current rate of ~145 units/period, we need ~725 units. We have 714, which is nearly sufficient. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4-period window to capture the current summer demand level (~145/period) and maintain a stable L of 4. Since we have sufficient stock for the current cooling regime and high holding costs relative to the cooling demand, no significant new order is required this period.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime shift: Average demand for the first week of July (P21: 127) suggests a further decline from the June average (~148), consistent with summer seasonality for denim jackets.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Slim Denim Jacket) is entering a mid-summer seasonal trough. Demand has trended consistently downward from the spring peak (~205) into June (~148) and now July (P21: 127, P22: 104). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P19-P22) is approximately 130 units/period. The current on-hand inventory (391) and in-transit units (288, excluding the lost shipment from P14) total 679 units, which covers more than 5 periods of forecasted demand at current rates (L+1 = 5). I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to target the most recent July demand cooling trend and setting L to 'calculate' as the actual lead time has remained stable at 4 periods for all successful shipments. This configuration will allow the backend to use a lower base stock, avoiding excessive holding costs during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand decline confirmed: Average demand for the first half of July has dropped to ~115 units/period (P21-P22), confirming the seasonal shift away from denim jackets in summer heat.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for the denim jacket (399061008) continues its seasonal cooling trend as we move deeper into summer. Demand for the last three periods (P21-P23) has been 127, 104, and 111, yielding a recent average of approximately 114 units/period. This is a significant decrease from the June average (~148) and the spring peak (~205). The shipment from Period 14 is confirmed lost. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of P21, P22, and P23). Current on-hand inventory is 381 and in-transit is 234, totaling 615 units of pipeline inventory. Given that the base stock target (covering 1+L = 5 periods) at the current demand rate (5 * 114 = 570) is already exceeded by the current pipeline, the goal is to allow inventory to draw down while maintaining slightly higher service levels to account for potential demand variability. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent July demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Mid-to-late July demand regime confirmed: Average demand for the first three weeks of July (P21-P23) is 114 units/period, down ~23% from the June average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $961.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a denim jacket, which is experiencing clear summer seasonal decline. Demand in Period 24 dropped significantly to 73 units, dragging the recent average (P21-P24) down to 103.75 units/period. This confirms a sustained cooling regime from the June average (~148) and the early spring peak (~210+). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent conclusive arrivals (P22-P24). On-hand inventory is currently high at 426 units, which is roughly 4-5 periods of cover at current demand levels. Pipeline inventory includes 116 units (P22: 69, P23: 47). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 542 units. Given L=4, we need to cover L+1=5 periods. 542 / 103.75 \u2248 5.2 periods of cover. Consequently, holding costs are a significant risk. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the latest July cooling and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand regime shift: Demand in Period 24 (73 units) confirms a deepening seasonal decline for denim jackets in high summer, with the July average (P21-P24) falling to ~104 units/period, down ~30% from June.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. We are analyzing the demand for a women's denim jacket, which is entering into what is traditionally the tail end of the summer season and approaching the potential early autumn uptick. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal decline through July: Period 21 (127), P22 (104), P23 (111), P24 (73), and P25 (78). The average demand over these last 5 periods is approximately 98.6 units. This confirms a significant cooling from the June average of ~148 and the spring peak of ~205. The shipment from Period 14 is confirmed lost. My current on-hand inventory is 348 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand (approx. 3.5 weeks of cover). In-transit is 177 units (from P22, P23, P25). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this new lower late-summer regime while maintaining the default sigma_hat to account for historical volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods despite the singular loss in Period 14.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand regime shift confirmed (late July/early August): Average demand dropped to ~99 units/period (P21-P25), a 33% reduction from the June average (~148), reflecting deepest summer seasonality for denim jackets.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019, which is late summer. Demand for denim jackets has significantly cooled from the spring peak (~205) and June/July levels (~148/104). The last five periods (P22-P26) show a stabilized late-summer demand baseline of approximately 86.6 units/period (104, 111, 73, 78, 67). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, with the exception of the confirmed lost shipment from P14 and a missing arrival message for the P21 order (ordered 0 units, so no arrival expected). Total inventory position is 686 units (350 on-hand + 336 in-transit), which covers roughly 8 periods of current demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low-demand summer regime (approx 89 units/period), allowing the OR backend to maintain a buffer that accounts for the lower seasonal interest before potential fall restocking begins.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand regime (August) confirmed: Average demand for the past 5 periods has dropped to ~87 units/period, a significant reduction from the June (~148) and early July (~114) averages.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand for denim jackets has significantly cooled as we move through late summer, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) being approximately 82.8 units/period. The most recent demand (P27) was 85 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The order from P14 is confirmed lost, and P21 and P24 had zero orders, which simplifies the pipeline. Our current inventory (On-hand: 312, In-transit: 289) and the current slow demand regime mean we are well-covered for the (L+1) period window. Setting N=5 for mu_hat captures this late-summer trough accurately, and default sigma_hat is sufficient given the reduced volatility in this low-demand state.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26). Demand for denim jackets has entered a late summer low, with the most recent 5-period average (P24-P28) being approximately 73.6 units, compared to the spring peak of >200. Period 28 demand was 65, confirming the downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P26 and P27). Note that the order from Period 21 was for 0 units, which reflects as a missing arrival in Period 25. The on-hand inventory (247) plus in-transit (384) equals 631 units, which is quite high relative to current demand (~74/period). Since profit is $19 and holding cost is $1, the backend naturally targets a high service level, but the high pipeline means current orders will likely be capped or zeroed. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the late summer trough and L to default (4).

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand trough confirmed (late August): Avg demand for the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is ~74 units/period, a significant decline from the June average (~148) and early July (~114).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 2nd, entering the early autumn season. Historical data shows demand for this denim jacket has been in a sustained late-summer trough, with the last 5 periods (P25-P29) averaging ~67 units/period (78, 67, 85, 65, 40). Period 29 shows a further drop to 40 units. As we move into September, we expect a potential modest recovery as weather cools, but there is no evidence of this yet. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by the arrival of P25's order in P29). Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 268, In-transit: 323) relative to recent demand. We maintain a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture the current trough while the high on-hand levels provides a buffer if autumn demand spikes sooner than expected. The Period 24 order is likely lost (7 periods since ordering), so pipeline calculations remain healthy with the remaining 323 units in transit.

Carry-over insight: Early autumn transition (September): Demand remains in trough with the most recent observation (P29: 40 units) being the lowest since early March, confirming the end of summer clearance/low interest phase.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for the denim jacket continues to be in a seasonal trough (latest observation P30: 43 units) as summer ends. The average demand over the last five periods (P26-P30) is approximately 59.6 units per period, which is significantly lower than the July average (~104) and the June average (~148). This suggests that while autumn is approaching, the transition to increased demand for outerwear like denim jackets hasn't begun yet. On-hand inventory is currently high (453 units), covering over 7 periods of current demand at the recent average. Pipeline inventory includes 95 units ordered in P28, expected to arrive in P32. Given the high inventory and low demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current trough while excluding the significantly higher July data. I will keep L at its default promised lead time of 4, as recent arrivals (P29, P30) consistently confirm a 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: September demand remains in a seasonal trough for denim jackets with an average of ~60 units/period (Periods 26-30), confirming the post-summer low interest regime persists into early autumn.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for denim jackets has entered a deep seasonal trough as we transition into early autumn. Recent demand (P29-P31: 40, 43, 39) confirms a sustained low-interest phase with a mean of ~40 units/period, down from the late August average of ~74. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 414) relative to this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand balance and the decreasing demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the current trough of ~40 units/period (totaling ~200 for 1+L periods). This will allow the OR backend to stop ordering until inventory levels align with current autumn demand, minimizing holding costs for this seasonal item.

Carry-over insight: Mid-September demand trough confirmed: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P29-P31) has stabilized at ~41 units/period, a significant drop from the August average (~74), representing the lowest demand regime observed since the spring transition.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399061008 (Denim Jacket) is currently in a deep seasonal trough during September. The demand has stabilized at a low mean of approximately 41 units per period (Periods 29-32 readings: 40, 43, 39, 42). This represents the lowest demand regime observed since the start of the simulation. With an on-hand inventory of 467 units and zero in-transit, the current stock covers over 11 periods of demand at the current rate (467 / 41 \u2248 11.3), which far exceeds the (L+1) requirement of 5 periods (L=4). There is no risk of stockout; conversely, the primary concern is minimizing holding costs during this low-interest phase. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 samples (N=4) to accurately reflect the trough mean, and sigma_hat to reflect the current low volatility, allowing the OR backend to naturally suppress further ordering until inventory is depleted to safer levels.

Carry-over insight: September demand trough confirmed: Demand for Periods 29-32 is extremely stable at an average of 41 units/period, marking the lowest regime in the product's cycle.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Women's Denim Jacket) is currently in a deep seasonal trough as of late September (Periods 29-33), with demand stabilizing at a very low average of approximately 41 units per period. This represents a significant decline from the summer levels (~148 in June, ~104 in July) and is nearly 80% lower than the spring peak (~205). On-hand inventory is currently 417 units, which covers approximately 10 periods of the current demand regime (41 units/period). Given the 4-period lead time and the current high inventory levels, no new orders are needed. The OR parameters are set to reflect this stable low-demand regime using a recent 5-period window to capture the September stabilization, while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while carrying excessive stock into the next seasonal transition.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7th. We are in a consistent seasonal low for denim jackets, following a deep summer trough. Demand has stabilized over the last 6 periods (P29-P34) at an average of 42 units per period (40, 43, 39, 42, 50, 38). On-hand inventory is currently 379 units with no units in transit. Given the current average demand (~42) and a lead time of 4 periods, our existing inventory covers approximately 9 periods of demand (379 / 42), which is well beyond the L+1 (5 period) safety target. The OR backend will likely not place an order because on-hand exceeds the base stock level. I will set the demand parameters using the recent stable regime (N=6) to reflect the current autumn trough and use the default lead time which has remained consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: September/Early October demand trough confirmed: Average demand for the last 6 periods (P29-P34) is ~42 units/period, representing the lowest sustained regime in the cycle.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. We are analyzing a Slim Denim Jacket, which typically follows clear seasonal arcs: a significant spring peak and a mid-summer decline. Historical demand shows a deep trough beginning in September (Period 29), with the most recent observation (Period 35) hitting a cycle low of 18 units. This represents a further cooling from the already low 'September trough' of ~41 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 361 units, and there are no units in-transit. Given the extremely low demand (18 units) and the high stock-to-sales ratio (over 20 periods of cover at current rates), no new orders are necessary. The priority is to avoid additional holding costs while the product likely enters a late-autumn/winter clearance or low-interest phase. L is set to 'default' as lead times have consistently been 4 periods. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using 'recent_N' with N=5 (Periods 31-35) to capture the most recent and relevant demand deceleration in the autumn trough, which averages ~37.4 units/period, down from the summer average.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand trough deepening: Average demand for October (P34-P35) has dropped to ~28 units/period, significantly lower than the September average (~41), indicating a continued seasonal decline for denim jackets as winter approaches.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Denim Jacket) is in a deep seasonal trough as we move through October. Current demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average demand over the last three periods (P34-P36) being approximately 29.3 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 329 units, with no units in transit. Given the current demand regime, the on-hand stock is sufficient to cover more than 10 periods of demand (329 / 29.3 \u2248 11.2 periods), which far exceeds the lead time plus one period (L+1 = 5). No new orders have been placed since Period 28, allowing the system to naturally bleed off the excess inventory accumulated from previous over-ordering. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent 3-period regime to prevent the OR backend from triggering any unnecessary orders while existing stock is depleted. The inventory management priority remains minimizing holding costs while demand is seasonally low.

Carry-over insight: Late October demand trough confirmed: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P34-P36) is ~29 units, reflecting the lowest regime in the annual cycle for this SKU.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Denim Jacket) is in its deepest seasonal trough as of late October (Period 37). Demand has stabilized at an extremely low mean of approximately 24 units/period over the last three weeks (P35-P37: 18, 32, 23). The current on-hand inventory is 306 units with zero units in transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we must cover demand for approximately 5 periods (L+1). At the current demand rate, the required stock to cover 5 periods is roughly 120 units (5 * 24). Since current on-hand inventory (306) significantly exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to capture this localized late-autumn trough while maintaining a conservative sigma_hat. The goal is to allow inventory to bleed down through natural sales to minimize further holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is a denim jacket, which is currently in a deep seasonal trough as winter approaches. Demand has consistently declined from its spring peak (~205) and summer average (~148) to a very low late-autumn regime. The last 5 periods (P34-P38) show demands of 38, 18, 32, 23, and 13, averaging 24.8 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 293 units with no units in transit. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5), we need to cover demand for the next 5 periods. Even at the recent average of ~25 units/period, 293 units on hand is more than double the required stock (approx 125 units) to cover the pipeline + safety stock. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) to reflect this low demand and prevent the OR engine from over-ordering due to legacy high-demand samples from spring/summer.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn trough (late Oct/early Nov) confirmed: Demand for denim jackets has dropped to an average of ~25 units/period (Periods 34-38), down significantly from the ~40 units/period seen in September.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Denim Jacket) is in a deep late-autumn/early-winter demand trough as of November 11th. Demand has dropped significantly from the spring peak (~205) and summer average (~148) to a current 5-period average (P35-P39) of approximately 20.4 units. Specifically, the last three periods (P37-P39) averaged only 17.3 units. With 277 units currently on-hand and zero in-transit, the inventory covers nearly 13-14 weeks of current demand, which is far beyond the (L+1) requirement of 5 weeks. No new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent low-demand regime using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the stabilization around 20-30 units, and use default settings for lead time and sigma.

Carry-over insight: November demand trough confirmed: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) has stabilized at ~20 units/period, the lowest in the annual cycle for denim jackets.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399061008' (Denim Jacket) is in a deep seasonal trough as of mid-November. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 19.8 units/period, down from the September average of ~41. This aligns with the seasonal profile of lightweight denim jackets in late autumn/early winter. Current on-hand inventory is 262 units, which is extremely high given the current demand regime (sufficient for >13 periods). There are no units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (except for one lost shipment in P14 and P21). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current trough, and L to default (4). The OR engine should not place any new orders given the massive inventory surplus relative to the low demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for the 'Jacket Slim' (denim jacket) has reached a late-autumn trough, as expected for this product category. The most recent demand samples (P38-P41) were 13, 16, 15, and 15, showing high stability at a low level (mean ~15 units/period). This represents a significant drop from the early November average of ~20. On-hand inventory is currently at 247 units, which is extremely high given the current demand regime (~16 periods of supply). With only 6 periods remaining in the game (ending P47), the objective is to minimize holding costs while liquidating existing stock. No new orders are needed (OR backend will naturally result in 0 orders as base_stock will be much lower than on-hand). I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-seasonal minimum accurately.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand trough stabilized in November: Demand for Periods 38-41 has converged to a mean of ~15 units/period, down from the October average of ~25.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019. We are in the final periods of the simulation (Period 43/47). The product, a washed denim jacket, is in its deepest seasonal trough during the winter months. Recent demand (Periods 38-42: 13, 16, 15, 15, 35) has been extremely low, averaging approximately 19 units per period. The slight uptick to 35 units in Period 42 may be a minor pre-holiday fluctuation but does not represent a sustained regime shift. With 212 units on-hand and only 5 periods remaining in the game, the current inventory exceeds the total projected demand for the rest of the simulation (approx. 19 units/period * 5 periods = 95 units). Therefore, no new orders are required. Parameters are adjusted to reflect this ultra-low demand regime using recent_N (N=5) to capture the November/December trough accurately for the OR backend stats, while ensuring the cap and base stock logic do not trigger unnecessary purchasing.

Carry-over insight: December demand trough confirmed: Average demand for late November/early December (P38-P42) is ~19 units/period, reflecting the absolute seasonal minimum for denim jackets.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. We are in a deep seasonal trough for denim jackets, which is consistent with early winter weather. Demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) has averaged 17.4 units/period (16, 15, 15, 35, 6). The spike in P42 (35 units) appears to be an outlier or a very brief promotion, as P43 returned to a very low level (6 units). On-hand inventory is 206 units, with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are effectively covered for more than 10 periods at the current consumption rate (~20 units/period). Therefore, no new order is required. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5-period average to reflect this localized trough, which will result in a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand levels, ensuring no order is triggered by the OR backend.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand for the 'Jacket Slim' denim jacket is in its absolute seasonal trough as winter settles in. Last period's demand was only 1 unit, and the average for the last five periods (P40-P44) is approximately 14.4 units. We have 205 units on-hand and zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we are effectively covered for the remainder of the simulation (which ends at Period 47). No further orders are required, and the inventory is significantly above the expected demand (14.4 * 5 = 72 units) for the look-ahead window. I will set the OR parameters to reflect this extremely low demand regime to ensure the backend does not place unnecessary orders, while relying on the existing on-hand inventory to satisfy any residual demand.

Carry-over insight: December demand trough confirmed: Average demand for the first half of December (P43-P44) has fallen below 5 units/period, marking the seasonal floor for this SKU.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). Demand for women's denim jackets is at its absolute annual trough, with December observations showing extremely low levels (6, 1, 9 units). The average demand for the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 13.2 units, and the most recent 3 periods (P43-P45) average just 5.3 units. With 196 units on hand and 0 in-transit, the inventory is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods of the year (Game ends at P47). No further orders are required. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this seasonal floor, while keeping L at 'default' (promised 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: End-of-year seasonal floor confirmed: December demand (P43-P45) dropped to a mean of ~5.3 units/period, representing the absolute minimum in the annual cycle for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim jacket, which is currently at its seasonal absolute floor in late December/early January. Recent demand (Periods 43-46) has been extremely low: 6, 1, 9, 8 (average ~6 units/period). With on-hand inventory at 188 units and no items in transit, the current stock covers over 30 periods of demand at the current rate. The objective is to minimize holding costs while the SKU is in this deep seasonal trough. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the late December stabilization) to reflect this low-demand regime. This will prevent the OR engine from generating unnecessary orders while on-hand inventory is high.
