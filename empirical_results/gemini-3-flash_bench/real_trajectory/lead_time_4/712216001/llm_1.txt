  "rationale": "Product Description: Women's V-neck vest top (spaghetti straps). This is a spring/summer item suited for warmer weather or layering. Date: 2019-02-11 (mid-February). Historical demand (Jan-Feb) has been declining/stabilizing: 120, 87, 80, 68, 73 (Avg \u2248 85 units). However, as we approach spring, demand for this 'Everyday Collection' vest top is likely to increase. Logistics: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to cover demand for current period (P1) plus the lead time (P1-P5). Based on historical average of 85, 5 periods of demand equals 425 units. Considering the upcoming spring season and the high cost of being out of stock (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will order slightly above the current mean to build inventory for the lead-time window.",

In mid-February (Date: 2019/2/18), demand is expected to be steady or slightly increasing as consumers begin transition shopping toward spring, though we are still in a colder season. b) Demand Analysis: Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a range of 68-120, averaging 85.6. Period 1 demand was 91, which is consistent with the historical mean. I will forecast demand at approximately 90 units per period. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order of 450 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Demand in Period 1 (91) resulted in lost sales because the starting inventory was 0. In-transit is 450. e) Order Logic: To cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods (Periods 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), I need approximately 450-500 units. The Period 1 order of 450 units is currently in transit. To prevent further stockouts after that shipment arrives and to account for the Period 1 lost sales, I must maintain the pipeline. Since the next order placed now (Period 2) would arrive in Period 6 (visible Period 7), I need to ensure coverage for Period 6. Based on an average demand of 90, 450 units covers 5 periods. I will place an order of 90 units to maintain a rolling inventory pipeline of roughly one mean-demand unit per period of lead time plus the decision period.",

The first three periods of the game show demand (91, 106, 91), averaging ~96 units/period. No sustained regime shift is yet visible, but we should prepare for a seasonal uptick. c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Promised lead time is 4. My Period 1 order (450 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Currently, nothing has arrived, which is consistent with the 4-period lead time. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand is 0 (due to lack of arrivals). In-transit is 650 (P1: 450, P2: 90, P3: 110). Total Pipeline = 650. e) Order Logic: Based on an average demand of ~100/period and a lead time of 4, the order-up-to level for L+1 (5 periods) should be approximately 500-600 units (plus safety stock). Since the pipeline already contains 650 units, I am sufficiently covered for the next 5-6 weeks of demand at current rates.

The P22 drop might be partially influenced by stockouts, but generally, early July remains a high-demand period compared to the May average of 60.

{
  "rationale": "The product is a women's V-neck vest top (summer/everyday category), currently in its deep off-season (mid-December). Recent demand patterns confirm this: Period 44 saw only 3 units of demand, and December has averaged 24 units/period, mostly driven by a small holiday lift in late November/early December. We are currently at Period 45 out of 47, meaning only 3 periods of demand remain (P45, P46, P47). With an on-hand inventory of 423 units and no in-transit orders, the current stock is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining periods (estimated at <15 units/period for late Dec). In fact, the primary risk is excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) on the remaining 423 units. No further orders are required as we aim to minimize ending inventory and associated costs at the game's conclusion.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a women's V-neck woven vest top with spaghetti straps. Given the current date (Dec 23, 2019), it is in the deep off-season for the Northern Hemisphere. Demand has been highly erratic but generally low over the last few periods (P42: 41, P43: 28, P44: 3, P45: 56), likely reflecting sporadic holiday-related shopping or clearance sales. The current on-hand inventory is 367 units, which is extremely high (serving ~12-18 weeks of demand even at late-spring levels). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. There is no need to order as the current stock safely covers lead-time demand plus several months of the upcoming spring transition. Maximizing total reward requires minimizing holding costs by not adding to the surplus inventory.",
  "carry_over_insight": "End-of-year demand volatility: December demand (P42-P45) fluctuated significantly (range 3-56, avg 32) compared to November lows (avg 12), likely due to holiday seasonality, but remaining far below summer peak levels.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a women's V-neck woven top with spaghetti straps, which is highly seasonal for spring and summer. We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30), approaching the start of the new calendar year. Historical data from early 2019 (P1-P5, Feb-Mar) showed demand starting at approximately 90-100 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 338 units, which is significantly more than needed for the current deep off-season demand (avg ~30 units/period in December). Even if demand begins to rise in February 2020 as it did in February 2019, the existing 338 units cover over 3 periods of early-season demand (~100 units/period) plus current inventory buffers. Given the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 51 (late Jan/early Feb). However, with 338 units on hand and very low current demand, there is no risk of stockout in the next 4-6 weeks. I will continue to bleed off high inventory levels to minimize holding costs.",
