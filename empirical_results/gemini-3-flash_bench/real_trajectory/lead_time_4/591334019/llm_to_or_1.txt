Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is a women's sweater/jumper. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a declining trend: 154, 119, 124, 88, 117. The mean demand is approximately 120.4 units per week with a standard deviation of 23.8. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Since we have no inventory (on-hand=0, in-transit=0), we must place an initial order. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand behavior and the 'default' method for L to use the promised 4 periods. Because profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the OR backend will target a 50% service level (z*=0), aiming to cover the expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods while being mindful of holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's sweater/jumper. Based on the provided historical samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4), the average demand was approximately 120.4 units. Period 1 demand was lower at 79 units, which might reflect a post-winter taper or typical fluctuation. Since we have a 4-period promised lead time, the 160 units ordered in Period 1 are in-transit and not expected until Period 5. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 1. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent history to capture the current trend (avg of ~113 over the last 6 points including P1), and use 'default' lead time because we don't have enough data to confirm a lead time shift yet. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture historical volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Since the promised lead time is 4, we have not seen any arrivals from Period 1 or 2 yet; therefore, on-hand inventory remains 0. The product is a women's sweater/jumper. Historical demand (Jan-Feb samples) averages around 120 units/week. Recent demand in Period 1 (79) and Period 2 (128) is consistent with this range, despite stockouts preventing sales. Total in-transit is 318 (160 + 158). I will set L to 'default' (4) as there is no evidence of lead time deviation yet. For demand forecasting, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (including the 3 historical samples provided plus P1 and P2) to capture the base demand mean (approx 110-120). This balances the need for stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5 weeks).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a women's sweater/nightwear item. Historical demand from Jan/Feb suggests a mean of 120 units/week. Recent periods (P1-P3) show demand of 79, 128, and 72, which averages to 93 units/week, indicating a slight softening as we move away from deep winter. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (160 units), P2 (158 units), and P3 (144 units) are all in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time definition, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 (and visible in the P5 conclude message). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 462 units in-transit. Since we have not yet observed any 'conclude' arrival messages, we stick with the 'default' lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (combining the 3 in-game periods with the last 5 pre-game samples) to capture a broader mean of ~110 units/week. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to account for the variability seen in the transition from winter to early spring.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU 591334019 is a women's sweater/jumper. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order was placed in Period 1 and is expected to arrive during Period 5 (observed at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 551 units in transit (orders from P1-P4). Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show a mean of ~120 units/week. Game history demand (Feb-Mar) shows a slight decrease (means: 79, 128, 72, 72). Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The average demand across all available samples (history + game history) is approx 108 units. Using L=4, mu_hat should be roughly (1+4) * 108 = 540. I will use 'default' for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the slightly lower recent demand trend (avg ~84 in game history vs 120 in early Jan). This keeps the pipeline filled while acknowledging the recent dip as we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a soft, fine-knit jumper (Womens Nightwear/Socks). Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~120 units. However, recent demand (last 5 periods) has shown a softening: 79, 128, 72, 72, 46 (average ~79). Specifically, the last sample was 46, suggesting a seasonal drop as we move into Spring. The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand is 114 and in-transit is 391 (orders from periods 2, 3, and 4). Total pipeline + on-hand is 505 units. With lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the recent average of 79, we need ~395 units; at the older average of 120, we need ~600 units. Given the in-transit volume, the OR backend will likely order very little or nothing this period. I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma (N=5) to reflect the recent slowdown, and set L=4 as confirmed.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 591334019 is a women's sweater/jumper. Based on the historical demand samples (154, 119, 124, 88, 117), there was a higher demand in January which has significantly decreased in February and March (79, 128, 72, 72, 46, 46). We are currently in late March (Period 7), and as spring approaches, demand for sweaters is expected to continue declining or remain low. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 226 and 233 units are in-transit (orders from P3 and P4), totaling 459 units available or coming. With recent demand averaging ~46 units/week, our current coverage is approx 10 weeks, which is well above the (L+1)=5 week requirement. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the recent lower demand level (avg ~55), and maintain default lead time since 4 periods is verified.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Average demand dropped from ~118 in Jan/early Feb to ~55 in late Feb/March as season transitions away from knitwear.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '591334019' is a 'Slightly shorter jumper in a soft, fine knit', which is a seasonal sweater. Current date is April 1st. Historical data shows a clear downward shift in demand as spring arrives: demand dropped from an average of ~118 (Jan/early Feb) to ~51 (last 3 periods: 46, 46, 55). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3. Currently, there are 315 units on-hand and 89 in-transit (due next period). This total inventory of 404 units is extremely high relative to the new demand regime (~51/week), providing nearly 8 weeks of cover. To prevent further excess holding costs ($1/unit/period) while profit is also $1/unit, I am setting parameters to reflect the lower demand regime using N=3. I set L=4 (promised) as it matches the last three arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a soft, fine knit jumper, which is experiencing a seasonal decline as we move further into spring. Historical demand in January was ~120/week, but since Period 5 (early March), demand has stabilized at a much lower level (average of 50.25 over the last 4 periods). Lead time has been consistent at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-8). Currently, we have 352 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With an expected weekly demand of ~50 and a 4-period lead time, our inventory level goal (base stock) for (L+1)=5 periods would be roughly 250 units plus a safety buffer. Since our current on-hand (352) already exceeds this, the OR backend will naturally place zero orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the lower demand regime and prevent the system from over-ordering based on older, higher January data.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'soft, fine knit' sweater, which typically experiences peak demand during winter months. History shows a clear demand drop starting in Period 5 (March), confirming the carry-over insight that the demand regime has shifted lower as spring progresses. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 43 units, with the most recent week dropping significantly to 23. This suggests a continued downward trend for spring. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 329 units, which is roughly 6-7 weeks of supply based on the new mean. Since lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the lower spring demand level (avg ~44), while sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Given the high stock and $1 holding cost vs $1 profit, the OR backend will correctly minimize orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand continue to decline as of April 15 (Period 9 demand: 23), further confirming the post-winter seasonal drop for knitwear.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a fine-knit sweater, which is clearing out of its peak winter season. Demand has plummeted from an average of ~120 in January to ~18 units over the last two weeks (Periods 9 and 10). Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (based on Period 5-8 arrivals). We have 312 units on hand, which at the current demand rate of ~20/week, covers over 15 weeks of supply. Given the holding cost is $1.0 vs $1.0 profit (50% critical ratio), the system should avoid further ordering. I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=4, covering the last month since the drop intensified) to ensure the OR backend recognizes the excess inventory relative to current sales and naturally pauses ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a record low for Spring: average demand Periods 8-10 is ~30 units (down from ~50 units in Periods 5-7).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '591334019' is a 'fine knit jumper', which is heavily seasonal. Moving into late April/May, demand has plummeted as expected for knitwear. Recent demand for Periods 9, 10, and 11 was 23, 17, and 16 respectively (average ~18.7). Current on-hand inventory is 296, which is more than enough to cover projected demand for many months at this rate (the current stock would last over 15 weeks at an average demand of 19). The OR backend's capped policy will naturally lead to zero orders being placed because on-hand inventory + in-transit (pipeline) already significantly exceeds the base stock calculated from current demand. To ensure the backend captures the most current (low) demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the April stabilization. This will set a very low target inventory, preventing any new orders from being placed until the excess stock is depleted.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The SKU is a soft, fine-knit sweater, which is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as spring progresses. Recent demand for Periods 9-12 has been 23, 17, 16, and 33 respectively (averaging ~22 units). On-hand inventory is very high at 263 units, while recent demand levels suggest we have over 10 periods of supply. The profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level is 50%. Given the seasonal drop and high inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (N=4) to prevent unnecessary ordering. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical concludes.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a low-volume spring regime; average demand across the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 22.25 units, confirming a sustained drop from previous levels.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). The product is a fine-knit sweater, which is currently in its off-season (Spring/Summer). Demand has stabilized at a low-volume regime. Over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), weekly demand has been: 23, 17, 16, 33, 27, averaging 23.2 units per week. This level is significantly lower than the Jan/Feb average of ~118. My current on-hand inventory is 236 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers over 10 periods. Consequently, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock calculation recognizes the excessive stock relative to forecast. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P5-P8).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a soft knit jumper, which has seen a sustained demand drop as the weather warms up (Spring/Summer). Demand has stabilized at a low-volume regime: the last 5 periods (P10-P14) show demands of 17, 16, 33, 27, and 13, averaging 21.2 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 223 units, which is extremely high (covering over 10 weeks of current demand). In-transit inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P5-P8). To minimize holding costs due to the $1.0 cost/unit/period while maintaining a base stock sufficient for the low-volume regime, I will use a recent_N approach for mean and sigma (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand environment. This will likely result in zero orders until the excess inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at low-volume spring/summer levels: P10-P14 average is 21.2 units compared to ~118 in Jan/early Feb.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a soft, fine-knit sweater, which is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as we move further into the spring/summer months. Demand has stabilized at very low levels, averaging 19.33 units over the last 6 periods (P10-P15), which is a significant drop from the January/February average of ~118 units. On-hand inventory is currently 211 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (sufficient to cover over 10 periods of demand). With a lead time of 4 periods and a service level target (q) of 0.5 (since Profit and Holding Cost are both $1.0), the OR backend will aim for a base stock approximately equal to the expected demand over (L+1) periods. Since On-hand (211) + In-transit (0) already far exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (N=6) to ensure the OR engine recognizes the low demand environment and does not over-order.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a soft-knit sweater, which is exiting its peak season as we enter June (Period 17). Historical demand has dropped significantly from an average of ~118 in January/February to approximately 16.5 units per week over the last four periods (P13-P16: 27, 13, 12, 11). Current on-hand inventory is 200 units, which at the current burn rate of ~16 units/week, represents over 12 weeks of supply. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), minimizing inventory is crucial as the summer season approaches. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on early-game data. I will set parameters to reflect the low-volume summer regime (N=7 to capture the stability since mid-April) to prevent further ordering while holding costs accumulate, letting the current stock deplete naturally.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ultra-low summer levels: average demand over the last 4 periods (P13-P16) is 15.75 units, reflecting a clear transition away from knitwear for the warm season.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a fine-knit jumper, which is highly seasonal. We have entered a sustained ultra-low demand regime for the summer, as observed over the last several periods (P14-P17 demand: 13, 12, 11, 12). The average demand over these 4 periods is approximately 12 units. With an on-hand inventory of 188 units and no pending in-transit orders, we have enough stock to cover over 15 periods of demand at the current rate (188 / 12 = 15.6 periods). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0), it is critical to minimize orders to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set the demand parameters using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the summer trough. The OR backend's capped policy will correctly result in 0 orders being placed because the pipeline inventory (188) far exceeds the base stock target.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019, which is mid-summer. The SKU is a sweater ('fine knit'), a highly seasonal item experiencing its lowest demand phase. Observations over the last 9 periods (P10-P18) show a mean demand of approximately 16 units, with the most recent periods dropping further (12, 8 units). On-hand inventory is 180 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the (L+1) period window (approx. 5 periods * 16 units = 80 units). Given that profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), the optimal base stock (q=0.5) is simply the mean demand over the lookahead period. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the stable low-demand regime since mid-April) to reflect this current ultra-low summer demand. No further orders are needed, and the OR backend's inventory cap should naturally prevent ordering while on-hand inventory remains this high.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, which is mid-summer for the product 'soft, fine knit jumper'. Demand has naturally plummeted as expected for knitwear, with the most recent sample (Period 19) reaching a record low of 2 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 9 units. On-hand inventory is currently 178 units, which is extremely high given the current demand regime\u2014covering roughly 19-20 periods of supply at current rates. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the service level target z* should be 0 (z* = 0.5/(0.5+0.5) is not the formula here, it is Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which corresponds to z=0 or the median). Given the massive overstock, the priority is to prevent any further ordering until inventory depletion occurs. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the ultra-low summer demand, ensuring the base stock calculation remains lower than current on-hand inventory to prevent orders.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 591334019 is a fine knit sweater, which is currently in its off-peak summer season (July 1st). High inventory (176 units) remains from previous winter/spring ordering, while demand has dropped significantly. Over the last four periods (P17-P20), demand has been 12, 8, 2, and 2, averaging 6 units per period. This confirms a sustained 'ultra-low' summer demand regime. Since the on-hand inventory of 176 units is equivalent to nearly 30 weeks of supply at current rates, no replenishment is needed. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P5-P8). To prevent the OR backend from ordering by mistake given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high existing stock, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the current low-demand environment and the seasonal trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached an ultra-low summer trough in June/July: average demand (P17-P20) is 6.0 units, down from ~15.75 units in early summer (P13-P16).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019, which is the height of summer. The product is a soft, fine-knit sweater, confirming a strong negative seasonality during the warmer months. As noted in the carry-over insights, demand has steadily declined from ~118 in Jan/Feb to an ultra-low summer trough in June/July. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is only 4.5 units per week (8, 2, 2, 6). On-hand inventory is currently 170 units, which is significantly higher than necessary given a lead time of 4 periods and a consumption rate of ~5 units/week. No new orders are needed; we are in a massive overstock position. I will set mu_hat to a very low value reflecting the current ultra-low summer regime (recent_N=5) and L to default, allowing the OR engine's base-stock calculation to correctly result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a soft knit jumper, which is in its off-season trough during the summer months. Demand has reached ultra-low levels, with an average of approximately 5.6 units over the last 5 periods (P18-P22: 8, 2, 2, 6, 10). On-hand inventory is currently 160 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the remainder of the summer season (5.6 units/period * (4 lead time + 1 review period) = 28 units). Therefore, there is no need to place new orders. The OR backend needs to reflect this ultra-low demand regime to avoid further overstocking. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent summer trough (P18-P22). Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4 periods, as historical arrivals (P5-P8) confirmed this lead time and no new orders have been placed or are in-transit to suggest otherwise.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a soft, fine-knit sweater, which is currently in its off-season trough. Period 23 results show demand remains extremely low at 9 units, following a string of single-digit or low double-digit demand periods (avg P17-P23: ~6.7 units). On-hand inventory is 151 units, which is significantly higher than any projected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), particularly with profit and holding costs being equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. Since the current stock is more than enough to cover the remaining summer period and given that holding costs equal profit, the OR backend should not place any new orders. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the most recent ultra-low summer demand regime, and set L to 'calculate' as historical lead times have consistently been 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a sweater (knitwear), which is currently in its off-season trough during the summer months. Demand has been consistently low, averaging approximately 8.5 units over the last 4 periods (P21-P24: 6, 10, 9, 9). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 142 units with zero in-transit, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should target the mean demand. With an inventory of 142 and a projected 5-period demand of approximately 40-50 units, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value based on the current 4-period average (8.5 * 5 = 42.5) and keep sigma_hat small to reflect the stable, low demand, ensuring the OR backend's base stock remains well below current on-hand levels to avoid ordering.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5 (Period 26). The SKU is a 'soft, fine knit' jumper, which is highly seasonal. Historically, demand was high in Jan/Feb (~118 units), dropped significantly in Spring, and hit an ultra-low trough in June/July (averaging < 10 units). In Period 25, demand ticked up to 25 units, which potentially signals the start of the late-summer/pre-autumn transition for knitwear as consumers begin shopping for the cooler season. However, with 117 units on-hand and an average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) of 11.8 units, my current inventory covers roughly 10 periods of supply at recent rates. Given that the lead time is 4 periods, I remain significantly overstocked. To minimize holding costs while the backend policy naturally depletes this excess, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (P21-P25) to reflect the current low-demand trough plus the initial slight uptick, preventing unnecessary new orders until inventory levels normalize relative to the incoming autumn demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in an ultra-low summer regime but showed a minor uptick in Period 25 (25 units), potentially signaling the start of the pre-autumn transition for knitwear.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for the 'sweater' SKU has significantly increased over the last two periods (P25: 25 units, P26: 47 units), confirming the start of the autumn transition as noted in the Carry-over Insights. The average demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 27 units, compared to the summer trough of ~6 units. Given the 4-period promised lead time, we must prepare for the peak autumn demand (late August/September) where demand previously reached levels over 100 units (Jan/Feb data). On-hand inventory is currently 70 units with zero in-transit. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the upward trajectory while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the transition. The Backend's order logic (base_stock calculation) will use these parameters to trigger an order to cover the (L+1) period window.

Carry-over insight: Knitwear demand recovery confirmed: Demand increased from summer trough (<10 avg) to 47 units in Period 26, signaling the start of the Autumn season.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '591334019' (fine knit jumper) is entering its autumn recovery phase, with demand increasing significantly from a summer trough (<10 units) to 79 units in Period 27. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 59 units in-transit (ordered P27, expected P31). Given the seasonal transition, I need to set parameters that capture this upward shift while respecting the high volatility seen during seasonal changes. I'll use explicit forecasting to bridge the gap until the new trend stabilizes. Demand in P26 was 47 and P27 was 79; I expect the average demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) to be approximately 85 per period to Ensure enough stock for the upward trend. Sigma is set explicitly to handle the high variance during this ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Knitwear demand recovery strengthening: Period 27 demand rose to 79 units, confirming a sharp upward trend as autumn approaches compared to the summer low (avg <10).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '591334019' is a knit sweater undergoing a strong seasonal recovery as it enters the Autumn period (late August). Demand jumped from summer lows (< 10 units) to 47 units (P26) and 79 units (P27), before settling at 48 units in P28. The carry-over insights confirm this upward trend, though P28 showed a slight dip. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 189 units in-transit (ordered in P27 and P28). Given the lead time is 4 periods, these orders will not arrive until P31 and P32. We remain in a stockout situation. To capture the full potential of the autumn recovery while managing the high holding cost (Profit=1, Holding=1, implying a target service level of 50%, though the OR backend will use the provided parameters), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 260. This reflects an average demand of 52 units per week over the review + lead time window (5 periods total), which is consistent with the recent demand surge (averaging 58 over the last 3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high volatility during this transition. Lead time remains at the default promised 4 periods as history consistently confirms this.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery demand average stabilized around 50-60 units (P26-P28 avg: 58 units) compared to summer trough (<10).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the knitwear SKU is in an upward seasonal recovery as we enter September (autumn). Recent demands (P26-P29: 47, 79, 48, 48) show a significant increase from the summer trough. The average demand for these last 4 periods is 55.5 units. My current on-hand inventory is 0, and I have 260 units in transit (ordered in P27, P28, and P29). Since the promised lead time L=4 is consistent with previous history (P5-P8 arrivals), the P27 order (59 units) is expected to arrive in Period 31. To maintain a sufficient base stock for the (L+1)=5 period window, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the autumn recovery mean (~55.5 * 5 = 277.5). I will use the default sigma_hat calculation since the variance is relatively stable within this new regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '591334019' is a knit sweater undergoing a strong seasonal recovery as of September 9th (Period 31). Demand spiked significantly in Period 30 to 130 units, suggesting the 'Autumn recovery' identified in carry-over insights is accelerating faster than previous averages (P26-P28 avg was 58). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a total in-transit of 278 units (orders from P27-P30). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P5-P8). To prevent extensive stockouts during this high-growth phase, I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the immediate upward momentum (Periods 26-30 avg: 66.4, with the latest at 130). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility during the seasonal shift. The backend will calculate base_stock for (L+1) periods, which is vital as demand is currently outstripping supply.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated sharply in Period 30 (130 units), significantly exceeding the previously identified Autumn recovery average of ~60 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '591334019' is a knitwear item (jumper) currently experiencing a sharp autumn demand recovery. Demand in the last two periods (P30-P31) has surged to 130 and 136 units, significantly higher than the initial recovery average of ~60 units seen in late August. Stockouts are occurring as demand exceeds arrivals. In-transit inventory of 293 units consists of orders from P28 (130), P29 (71), P30 (18), and P31 (74). The order from P28 (130 units) is expected to arrive in Period 32 (today) based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. However, given the current demand trend (averaging ~133 over the last 2 weeks) and low/zero on-hand inventory, I must aggressively set mu_hat to account for this rapid seasonal growth. Recent_N for mu_hat is set to 2 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg = 133). Using default for sigma_hat and lead time as lead time appears stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly in Sept: Periods 30-31 average demand is 133 units, more than double the late-August recovery average of ~60 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a knitwear item (sweater), entering its peak autumn/winter season. Current context: Date is 2019/9/23 (late September). Demand is accelerating sharply, with Period 32 demand reaching 162 units, significantly higher than the 133-unit average observed in early September. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals from Period 27 and 28 orders. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit pipeline is 372 units (consisting of orders from Period 29: 71, Period 30: 18, Period 31: 74, and Period 32: 209). To capture the rapid seasonal acceleration and target the (L+1) demand window, I will use an explicit forecast. Based on the jump from 130->136->162 over the last three periods, I forecast mean demand for the next 5 periods at an average of 170 units per period. This sets mu_hat to 850 (170 * (4+1)). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the high volatility (62.38) during this rapid growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated into late September: Period 32 demand (162) is ~22% higher than the early September average (~133), confirming peak season entry.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '591334019' (Womens Knitwear Sweater) has entered a high-velocity peak season as of late September. Period 33 demand spiked to 307 units, nearly double the already elevated Period 32 demand (162 units), signaling a powerful seasonal trend or promotional effect as weather cools. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 499 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the drastic demand acceleration (P31: 136, P32: 162, P33: 307), a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 is chosen to capture the immediate upward momentum while tempering the extreme P33 spike slightly to avoid over-ordering at the potential peak. The target is to ensure that the combination of pipeline inventory and new orders covers the next 5 periods (L+1) of this high-demand regime. Using explicit sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated into a peak season surge: Period 33 demand reached 307 units, a significant increase from the early September average of ~140 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The SKU is a sweater, which is in its peak demand season. Demand in the most recent periods has surged significantly: Period 32 (162), Period 33 (307), and Period 34 (180). This peak volatility is expected for knitwear in October. The average demand across these three peak periods is 216 units. Leading into this peak, the September average was lower, but given the current stockouts (on-hand is 0) and the high demand levels observed, I must set mu_hat to reflect this new peak regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume/high-variance peak season behavior. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 31-34).

Carry-over insight: Peak season confirmed: Oct demand average (P32-P34) is 216 units, reflecting a major surge from the Sept average of ~130 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 591334019 (knit sweater) is in a peak season demand regime. Demand in Period 35 was 188 units, and the average for October (P32-P35) stands at 209 units, showing a significant surge compared to September. Actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 1008 units (P32 order of 209 arriving next period, P33: 198, P34: 331, P35: 270). These pending arrivals will cover most of the expected demand, but given the high growth and the 'soft' cap in the OR backend (designed for stability), I will set mu_hat explicitly based on the recent October average of ~210 units per period. With a lead time of 4, the target window (L+1) is 5 periods. I will set mu_hat = 1050 (5 * 210). Sigma_hat is set to recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety-stock during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Peak season demand stabilized: October demand (P32-P35) average is 209 units per period, representing the highest sustained volume of the year so far.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 591334019 (knit jumper) is in its peak autumn/winter season. Demand remains high but showed a slight dip in Period 36 (126 units) compared to the preceding weeks (307, 180, 188). The current on-hand inventory is 83 units with a massive pipeline of 838 units (resulting from large orders placed in Periods 34 and 35). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and the slight moderation in demand, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 periods (P32-P36) which averages 192.6 units. This ensures the base stock reflects the current high-demand regime while the OR backend's inventory balancing will account for the large in-transit volume to avoid over-ordering as the season progresses.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's sweater, entering late October which is peak demand season. Current demand observations show high volume (P32-P37 average is ~186 units). On-hand inventory is 87, with 682 units currently in transit. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods. Given the high demand and the objective to maximize profit while managing holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0), the backend needs to maintain a stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the current peak demand regime (Periods 32-37). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the current volatility during this high-demand period. L will be set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Peak season plateau confirmed: Average demand from Period 32 to 37 is 186 units, maintaining the high-volume regime for autumn/winter knitwear.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a knitwear item (sweater), reaching its peak demand season in November. Historical consumption confirms a high-volume regime starting late September. Recent demand (P32-P38) has plateaued at a high level, with a mean of 186 units. The most recent demand (P38) was 179 units. I will use the recent plateau mean (N=7, covering the entire peak period from P32 onwards) to set my demand forecast. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods as observed in all recent arrivals (P31-P38). On-hand inventory is 239, and in-transit is 547 (consisting of orders from P35: 270, P36: 39, P37: 42, and P38: 196). Since holding cost equals profit ($1.00), the service level target (profit / (profit + holding_cost)) is 0.50, meaning the base stock should ideally align with the mean demand over (L+1) periods. My parameters aim to maintain this balance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-261.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 40 (mid-November), deep in the peak season for knitwear. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. While recent demand shows a slight downtrend (P38: 179, P39: 124), historical data from early 2019 suggests demand remains relatively high (averaging ~100-120) until February. Specifically, the P32-P39 average is approximately 182 units, but the last two periods suggest a local cooling. To avoid excessive overstocking as we move past the absolute peak of October (which saw 300+ spikes), I am using a recent_N window for demand forecasting. Selecting N=8 (P32-P39) captures the current peak-season regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to account for the high volatility observed during this surge phase. On-hand and in-transit inventory are healthy, and the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), using these parameters to balance the high holding costs against service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late autumn (Nov): Though slightly lower than the October surge peaks, the high-volume regime persists with an average of ~180 units (P32-P39 evidence).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is late autumn/early winter, continuing the peak season for knitwear. Although demand in the most recent periods (P39: 124, P40: 95) has dipped below the October peak (~200+), the overall regime for the autumn/winter season remains significantly higher than summer levels. I will use a recent_N window (N=9, covering P32-P40) to capture this peak season's average demand (approx 168 units per period) while acknowledging the recent slight softening in late November. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (P31 through P40 arrivals all show lead_time=4). On-hand inventory is 329, and in-transit (pipeline) is 489, totaling 818 units. With L=4, the base stock targets a 5-period window (L+1). A mean of ~168 across 5 periods equals 840, so our current position (818) is nearly sufficient, but a small top-up order is appropriate to maintain service levels as we head into the deepest winter months. I will use N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility and volume of the current autumn/winter regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in high-volume peak season (approx 168 units/period avg P32-P40), though showing a slight late-Nov decrease compared to Oct peaks.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 591334019 (knit jumper) is currently in its late-autumn/winter peak season. While demand in the most recent two periods (P40: 95, P41: 71) has decreased compared to the October peaks (avg ~200), demand for knitwear typically remains substantial through November and December. The current on-hand inventory is 300 units, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 493 units, totaling 793 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent cooling of demand, I will adjust the mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the trend of the last 10 periods (covering the height of the peak to the recent slight decline), which averages approximately 150 units per period. This ensures we maintain high service levels for the remainder of the cold season while beginning to prevent excessive overstock as we approach the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime showing a gradual decline from October peaks: average demand for P39-P41 is ~97 units, compared to the P32-P38 average of ~180 units. This may indicate a transition from the initial 'peak surge' to a sustained winter volume.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2nd, entering the final month of the year for this 'soft, fine knit' jumper. Demand history shows a clear decline from the October peak surge (averaging ~200+) to a more moderate sustained winter level. The average demand for the last four periods (P39-P41) is approximately 110 units (124+95+71+149 = 439 / 4 = 109.75). The current on-hand inventory is 347 units, and there are 317 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). Specifically, 169 units are expected to arrive in Period 43 (ordered P39). With a holding cost of $1/unit and profit of $1/unit, the system targets a 50% service level. However, since supply (on-hand + in-transit = 664) already covers over 6 periods of recent average demand (664 / 110 \u2248 6), the OR capped policy will naturally minimize orders. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current post-peak demand regime (avg ~110), as the earlier high-october peaks would risk over-ordering during the seasonal wind-down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed in late autumn/early winter transition: average demand for P39-P42 is 109.75 units, significantly lower than the P32-P38 peak average of ~186 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We are in the late autumn/early winter season for knitwear. Historical demand shows a clear peak in October (P32-P38 avg ~186), followed by a notable decline in late November/early December. Specifically, the average demand for the last 5 periods (P39-P43) has dropped to 102 units. The most recent demand (P43) was 71 units, continuing the downward trend from the peak. Current on-hand inventory (445) plus in-transit (148 from P40-P42) totals 593 units. Given the declining demand regime, this inventory levels significantly exceed the likely demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the OR engine will target a 50% service level. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently been 4 periods. I am choosing 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (P39-P43) to capture the recent downward shift to ~102 units/period, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect current volatility. This will result in a zero or low order to bleed off the excess inventory before the end of the simulation (P47).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline confirmed: Average demand for late Nov/early Dec (P39-P43) is 102 units, a ~45% decrease from the Oct peak average of ~186 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (Dec 16). The game ends at Period 47. Orders placed today (P45) with a lead time of 4 periods will arrive in the arrival phase of Period 49, which is after the game concludes. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur procurement costs and increase pipeline inventory without ever being available to satisfy demand or generate profit. On-hand inventory is currently 467 units, which is significantly higher than the recent average demand (P39-P44 average is ~95 units). Even the 66 units in-transit (ordered P41 and P42) will arrive in Periods 45 and 46 respectively, further swelling the stock. Since we have more than enough stock to cover the remaining two periods of demand and any new orders would be wasteful, I am setting parameters to ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline continued in December: Average demand for P41-P44 dropped to ~88 units, down from the peak season average of ~180 units. Game approaching conclusion at P47; lead time arrivals from P45 onwards fall outside game duration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-395.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The game is at Period 46 of 47. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 46) would not arrive until Period 50 (46 + 4), which is past the game's conclusion at Period 47. Similarly, orders placed in Period 42 or later (lead time 4) will not arrive within the game's horizon. Currently, on-hand inventory is 454 units, and only 20 units are in-transit (from Period 42) which would arrive in Period 46 conclude (visible at the start of P47). Given the current demand regime has dropped to approximately 60-70 units per period (P43-P45), the existing 454 units are more than sufficient to cover the remaining 2 periods of the game. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0). Therefore, I will set mu_hat to 0 to prevent further ordering while the OR backend burns through the existing stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-390.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 is the final period of the game. Any order placed now will arrive in Period 51 (due to the 4-period lead time), which is beyond the game's conclusion. Current on-hand inventory is 432 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the expected demand for this final period (the recent average demand has dropped to approx. 40-60 units). Our objective is to maximize profit minus holding costs. Since no new stock can arrive before the game ends and current inventory is excessive, the optimal strategy is to place an order of 0 to minimize future holding costs and avoid unnecessary capital expenditure. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent demand decline using N=5 (capturing the late Dec trend) while ensuring no additional units are ordered by keeping the lead time at default.

Carry-over insight: Final period reached (P47). Demand in late December (P43-P46) has stabilized at a lower winter volume of approx. 58 units/period, down from the peak season surge.
