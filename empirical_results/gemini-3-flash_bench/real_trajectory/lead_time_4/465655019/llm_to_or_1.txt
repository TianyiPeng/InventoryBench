Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 465655019. This is a women's lingerie item (Thong briefs). Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 41.4 units/week with a standard deviation of 8.44. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are at the start of the horizon with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Given the profit/holding ratio (1.0/1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level, but the OR logic's capping will manage safety stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent average demand (41.4), which translates to a mu_hat of ~207 (5 * 41.4). Default sigma and lead time methods are appropriate as no lead time drift or volatility shifts have been observed yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's lingerie item (thong). Historical demand samples (n=5) show an average of 41.4 units/week with a standard deviation of 8.23. Period 1 demand was 39 units. Since on-hand inventory was 0 at the start of Period 1, we sold 0 units and have a stockout situation. An order of 56 units was placed in Period 1 but is in-transit (promised lead time is 4 periods, so it isn't expected until Period 5). To maximize reward, we must cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the base demand pattern while the first order is in flight. I'll stick to the promised lead time 'default' as we have no data to suggest a deviation yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's lingerie item (Thong). Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a mean of 41.4 units/week. Recent concluded periods (P1, P2) show slightly higher demand (39, 54; mean=46.5). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 112 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals are expected until Period 5 (visibility in P6). My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers demand for the lead time plus one review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current demand is stable but slightly increasing compared to the January baseline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 (5 historical + 2 concluded) to capture the recent mean of ~43 units/week. For lead time, I will use 'default' (4) as we have not yet reached the arrival window to verify actual performance. The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock and cap the order based on the 112 units already in the pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655019 is a women's lingerie item. Period 4 (2019/3/4) shows current on-hand inventory is 0, while 169 units are in transit. This is expected as the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (2019/2/11) are scheduled to arrive during Period 1+4=5, meaning they will be visible at the start of Period 6. Historical demand from the initial samples (38, 31, 51, 38, 49) averages 41.4 units/week. Observed demand in the game history (39, 54, 33) averages 42 units/week. There is no evidence of a demand shift or lead time deviation yet. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 (5 historical + 3 game samples) to capture the stable mean and 'default' lead time (4) to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 210 units). Since current in-transit (169) is below this, the OR engine will place a replenishment order.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a women's lingerie item (thong briefs). Historically, demand has averaged around 41 units (samples: 38, 31, 51, 38, 49) before the game started, and during the game, demand has been 39, 54, 33, and 27. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 209 units in-transit. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (1+4=5). Since Period 5 has just started and the arrival resolution phase occurs AFTER our decision, we should see the first arrival in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, there is no evidence that the lead time has drifted or that orders are lost. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (including pre-game samples) to capture the current demand level. mu_hat target = (1+L) * average demand = 5 * ~41 = 205. The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock and place an order to cover the pipeline gap.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is 'Womens Lingerie' (Thong briefs). Reviewing the history: The order from Period 1 (56 units) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 22. There are 153 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Historical demand samples (including the 5 samples provided initially and the 5 periods of play) are: 38, 31, 51, 38, 49 (initial list) and 39, 54, 33, 27, 34 (P1-P5). These samples exhibit relative stability with a mean around 39-40 units per period. No strong seasonal spikes are detected in mid-March for this category. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (covering all 10 available data points) to capture the base demand level while allowing the OR engine to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~200 units). Total pipeline (on-hand 22 + in-transit 153 = 175) is slightly below the expected 5-period demand, so the OR engine will likely place a small replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand remains stable around 40 units/week.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a women's cotton thong. Observed lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). Historical demand samples (last 5 available before start: 38, 31, 51, 38, 49) and game history demand (39, 54, 33, 27, 34, 33) show stability. The mean demand for the 6 periods in-game is 36.6 units. There is no evidence of a seasonal shift for this basic lingerie item in late March. Pipeline inventory is 119 (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6), and 45 units are on-hand. We need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using recent demand (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat as there have been no significant shifts. L is set to default as the confirmed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-04-01 (Period 8). The product is a women's lingerie thong (cotton jersey/lace), a staple item likely showing relatively stable demand with some weekly fluctuation. Historical demand samples (including pre-game and game history) are: 38, 31, 51, 38, 49 (pre-game) and 39, 54, 33, 27, 34, 33, 55 (game). The mean across all 12 samples is ~39.75. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7), matching the promised lead time. Inventory health: 47 on-hand + 82 in-transit = 129 units total pipeline. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~199 units). I will use recent_N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the slightly lower average demand of the last few weeks (~36.6/week) to avoid excessive holding costs, as profit and holding cost are equal (1:1), suggesting a balanced service level strategy (0.5 critical ratio) is optimal.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we've confirmed the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has been stable around a mean of 41 units with moderate variance. The current snapshot shows 40 units on-hand and 95 in-transit (orders from P6-P8). Using N=8 for demand statistics captures the full execution history while smoothing out individual period fluctuations. With lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Given profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level will be 50%, which is appropriate for a stable SKU. I will use the 'calculate' method for L since the observed lead times match the promised lead time of 4.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we observe the SKU 465655019 (Womens Thong Briefs). All historically concluded orders (P1-P4) have arrived with an actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. In Period 9, 'arrived=0' is consistent with the decision made in Period 5 (where 0 units were ordered). We have a pipeline inventory of 153 units (ordered in P6, P7, P8, P9) and on-hand inventory of 18 units. Historical demand across the last 14 samples (including pre-game) shows a mean of 41.2 and a standard deviation of 9.77. There is no significant seasonal evidence for thong briefs in April that suggests an immediate regime shift. Therefore, L is set to 'calculate' (which will yield 4), and mu_hat/sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (all available samples) to capture the stable demand profile and ensure the OR backend's service level logic is based on the most accurate variance.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lingerie item (thong briefs). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P6 order arrived P10). However, the order from Period 5 (arrived=0 in history) appears to be lost or significantly delayed, as it should have arrived in Period 9 based on the 4-period lead time. This has resulted in a stockout (on-hand inventory = 0). Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged ~38.6 units/week, which is slightly lower than the initial pre-period average (~41.4), but demand fluctuates (range 22-55). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend will naturally target a 50% service level (z=0) unless inventory parameters are adjusted. Given the stockout caused by the missing P5 shipment, I will maintain the lead time at 4. I will use a recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current demand mean of ~38.6, and use the default for sigma_hat to ensure the backend uses all available data for volatility. The high in-transit amount (157) includes the likely lost P5 order (0 units arrived) and subsequent orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10. The OR backend needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipment from Period 5 (lead time 4) failed to arrive (lost shipment), leading to a stockout in Period 10.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/4/29), we face an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) following a lost shipment from Period 5 (expected Period 9). Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 42 units/period (last 5 weeks: 33, 55, 47, 22, 40, 54). The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The system is currently recovering from the stockout, with 172 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while maintaining the lead time at the promised (and confirmed) 4 periods. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1), the OR engine will target a 50% service level, but the capped policy will ensures we order enough to cover the pipeline reflecting the 4-period lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is cotton-lace thong briefs. Current situation: On-hand is 0 due to recent stockouts (Periods 11 and 12), where demand (54 and 69) exceeded the arrivals (20 and 53). Demand is clearly trending upward from the initial ~40 units to ~60 units in the most recent weeks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by actual arrivals in P10, P11, and P12), but the Period 5 order was indeed lost. Pipeline (In-transit) is 165, covering orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12. To recover from the stockouts and capture the current high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to reflect the increased demand (avg ~50-60). L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from avg 40 (Periods 1-9) to avg 55+ (Periods 10-12). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is women's thong briefs. Analysis of recent demand (Periods 11-13) shows a significant increase: demand was 54, 69, and 58 respectively (average 60.3), compared to the earlier average of ~40. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last 3 periods), although a large 'In-transit' quantity of 186 units suggests replenishment is on the way (orders from P10-P13). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The shipment from P5 is confirmed lost. To recover from stockouts and meet this new higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the shift to ~60 units/period and keeping sigma_hat at default to account for the volatility seen during this shift. We need (L+1) * demand coverage (approx 300 units) including in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Baseline shifted from ~40 to ~60 units/period starting Period 11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lingerie staple (thong briefs). Current date is May 20th. Historical demand has shifted from a mean of ~40 (Periods 1-9) to a significantly higher regime. Specifically, the last four periods (11-14) show demands of 54, 69, 58, and 98 (mean = 69.75). The spike to 98 in Period 14 suggests high volatility or a seasonal trend approaching summer. Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0, and we have been stocking out for 4 consecutive periods because arrivals are insufficient for the new demand levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To restore service levels, I am setting L to 4. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture the shifted demand mean of ~70 (which translates to 350 over a 5-period cycle). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to account for the increased variance seen in the recent period (98 vs ~60). This will result in a larger base stock level to satisfy the current higher demand and clear the backlog.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly alongside the regime shift (Period 14 demand was 98, +40% over the previous period's high). Lead time remains 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). The SKU is experiencing a significant demand surge and stockouts. Demand for the last 5 periods (P11-P15) has averaged 74 units/period, compared to the initial baseline of ~40. The most recent demand points (98, 91) suggest the new regime is sustained and highly volatile. Current on-hand inventory is 0. While a shipment of 46 units (ordered P12) is expected to arrive during P16, it is insufficient to cover the estimated demand of ~90 units. Total in-transit is 304 units. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher mean (~370 for L+1=5 periods) and sigma_hat with recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility. The lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (excluding the lost P5 order). These parameters will raise the base stock level significantly to prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Avg demand increased from ~40 to ~75 units/period starting Period 11, with recent peaks >90 units. Increased volatility noted.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655019 is experiencing a significant demand regime shift and high volatility. Since Period 11 (late April/May), demand has spiked from an average of ~40 to recent peaks of 91, 98, and 101. The current average demand (Period 11-16) is ~78.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0 units. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) due to several periods of demand exceeding available stock (stockouts in Periods 11-16). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high demand and stockout risk, I am selecting recent_N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 = 5 periods) reflects the current trend (~394 units) plus a safety buffer for volatility, helping the backend maximize sales while managing the cost of the stockouts we are currently facing.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Avg demand increased from ~40 to ~79 units/period starting Period 11, with recent peaks exceeding 100 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655019 is currently experiencing a sustained demand regime shift that began around Period 11. Over the last 7 periods (Periods 11-17), demand has averaged 80.5 units per period, a significant increase from the initial average of approximately 40 units. The most recent demand samples are 54, 69, 58, 98, 91, 101, and 91, showing both higher volume and increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 13 order in Period 17 conclusion. The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand inventory = 0) despite consistent arrivals, because historical order quantities (based on the old demand regime) were insufficient to meet the new demand levels. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this higher demand level (~80.5 * (1+4) = 402.5). I will also set sigma_hat using the same N=7 to account for the increased volatility in this new regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher service level to end the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Avg demand increased from ~40 to ~80 units/period starting Period 11, with recent peaks exceeding 100 units. Stockouts are frequent due to inventory lagging the demand shift.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '465655019' (Women's Thongs) is experiencing a sustained demand regime shift. Since Period 11, demand has increased from an average of ~40 to ~80+ units per period, with volatility also rising (standard deviation based on recent 8 periods is approximately 17.5). The most recent demand (P18) was 75, following a peak of 101 in P16. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is critically low (1 unit). In-transit inventory is 326 units, representing orders from P15 (103), P16 (66), P17 (69), and P18 (88). The OR backend uses a base-stock policy where mu_hat represents demand over (L+Review) periods. With L=4 and Review=1, mu_hat should reflect the expected demand for 5 periods. Given the shift confirmed around P11, I will use a N=8 window (Periods 11-18) to capture this new higher-demand regime while excluding the low-demand legacy data. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to account for the ~400 unit pipeline requirement (5 * 80) and adequate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Avg demand since P11 is 79.6 units/period compared to ~40 units previously. Volatility remains high (StdDev ~17.5). Lead time is reliable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 465655019 has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 11. Analysis of the demand from P11 to P19 shows a mean of approximately 78.3 units per period (54, 69, 58, 98, 91, 101, 91, 75, 68). The standard deviation in this high-demand period is approximately 17 units. The Lead Time (L) is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since the current lead time is 4, the target inventory must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N with N=9 targets this specific regime to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that accommodates the increased demand while accounting for the current inventory of 36 on-hand and 295 in-transit.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 465655019 shifted significantly around Period 11, moving from an average of ~40 to an average of ~80 units per week. This coincides with the seasonal transition into late spring/summer for women's lingerie (Ginger Thong Maple Low). Recent demand observations (Periods 11-20) are: 54, 69, 58, 98, 91, 101, 91, 75, 68, 80. The average demand across these 10 periods is 78.5. Lead time is reliably 4 periods. Since the inventory is recovering from a sustained stockout period and the demand regime is now stable at this higher level, I will use recent_N=10 to capture this regime shift accurately for both the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). Pipeline inventory is healthy at 290, and on-hand is 22. Setting N=10 for both mu and sigma ensures the backend accounts for the higher volume and volatility of the current market segment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 465655019 has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 11, with an average demand of approximately 82 units per period and significant volatility (recent peak of 110 units in Period 21). On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to the recent demand spike. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0 each), the target service level q = 0.5. To account for the shifted demand baseline and high volatility, I am using recent_N (N=11, covering the high-demand regime from P11 to P21) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the (L+1) demand window (5 periods) with updated parameters to prevent further stockouts while balancing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to 21 shows an average of 82.3 units/period with a standard deviation of 17.6, significantly higher than the pre-P11 baseline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655019 has undergone a significant demand shift starting around Period 11, moving from an average of ~40 units to ~82 units. Recent periods (P19-P22) show demand of 68, 80, 110, and 93, with an average of 87.75 over the last 4 weeks. The system is currently in a stockout situation (Ending inventory: 0, 0 in last two periods) despite arrivals. The lead time of 4 periods remains consistent. Given the high volatility (recent peak 110) and significant stockout risk, I am focusing on the demand regime desde Period 19. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat captures this most recent level (avg 87.75), and recent_N=12 for sigma_hat captures the broader volatility seen since the regime shift began in Period 11. Lead time L is set to calculate to use the stable history of 4-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Post-shift demand (P11-P22) has further solidified around an average of 83 units, but the most recent 4 weeks (P19-P22) suggest a slightly higher local average of 87.75 units. Volatility remains high with a standard deviation around 17-18.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655019 is experiencing a sustained higher demand regime that began around Period 11. Over the last 13 periods (P11-P23), mean demand has been approximately 84.6 units per period, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~40. The most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) show an even higher intensity, averaging 92.6 units per period with a peak of 112. We are currently facing a series of stockouts because the supply pipeline is trailing this volume shift. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The goal is to provide parameters that reflect this elevated demand and heightened volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 18-20 in the new regime) to build sufficient safety stock. I will use recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full extent of the current demand regime starting from Period 11.

Carry-over insight: Post-P11 demand regime confirmed: Mean shifted from ~40 to ~85 units/period (P11-P23 avg: 84.6). Most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) show increased intensity averaging 92.6 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655019 has experienced a significant demand regime shift starting around Period 11, moving from an average of ~40 units/period to ~85 units/period. Most recently (Periods 19-24), demand has intensified further, averaging 90.5 units/period (68, 80, 110, 93, 112, 79). There are frequent stockouts because starting inventory and arrivals are failing to meet this elevated demand. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P20 order arrived P24). To address the current stockout (on-hand = 0) and the ongoing high demand, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the most recent high-intensity regime (averaging 90.5). For sigma_hat, I am also using N=6 to reflect the current high volatility (std dev ~17.5). This will push the base stock level higher to prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, despite the equal holding cost, as the high service level is necessary to satisfy the current demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand intensity (P19-P24) has averaged 90.5 units/period, slightly higher than the post-P11 average of 85. Volatility remains consistently high with frequent peaks exceeding 100 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '465655019' is currently in a sustained higher demand regime that began around Period 11. Analysis of demand since the shift (Period 11-25) shows a mean of approximately 86 units/period with significant volatility (standard deviation ~17.8). Recent demand specifically (Periods 19-25) has remained high, averaging 88.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently very low (4 units) following a series of near-stockouts or partial fills. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 21 order in Period 25). To ensure high availability and account for the high volatility and current low stock, I am setting L=4, mu_hat = 445 (covering 5 periods of demand at ~89 units/period), and sigma_hat using recent_N=15 to capture the volatility of the current regime. This mu_hat calculation is (1+L)*89.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655019 is experiencing a sustained higher demand regime that began around Period 11. Over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), demand has averaged 86.8 units with a standard deviation of 16.4. The most recent demand (P26) was 63 units, which is lower than the recent average, but looking at the trend since P11, demand remains volatile with frequent spikes above 100. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by multiple arrivals). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio yielding a high service level requirement, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of 16 periods to fully capture the post-shift regime (P11-P26) while providing enough data to stabilize the variance estimate. This ensures the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Post-shift demand regime (P11-P26) average confirmed at 82.5 units/period (vs pre-P11 avg of ~40). Recent 10-period volatility (P17-P26) shows a standard deviation of 16.4.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 465655019 has stabilized into a higher regime since Period 11, but the most recent four weeks (P24-P27) show a downward trend (79, 77, 63, 59) compared to the preceding peak (avg ~90). The average demand since Period 11 is approximately 81 units, while the recent 4-week average is 69.5 units. Given this recent cooling, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the transition from the peak back to the current levels (average ~75) while maintaining responsiveness to volatility (sigma_hat with N=10). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy (104), and the pipeline (250) accounts for orders from P24-P27. The goal is to move towards a balanced stock level without over-ordering as demand appears to be softening from its mid-summer highs.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling: Recent 4-period average (P24-P27) has dropped to 69.5 units compared to the P11-P23 average of 84.6.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 465655019 has exhibited a cooling trend over the last five periods (P24-P28), with an average of 67.0 units, significantly lower than the P11-P23 high-intensity average of ~85 units. Current on-hand inventory is 107 units with a substantial pipeline of 239 units. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we are currently over-inventoried for the recent lower demand levels. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this cooling trend and prevent further excessive stock accumulation, while maintaining a default sigma_hat to account for the historically high volatility of this item. The lead time (L) remains 4 based on consistent arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling sustained: Recent 5-period average (P24-P28) is 67.0 units, down from the P11-P23 peak average of 84.6.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655019 is experiencing a sustained 'cooling' of demand after a peak period (P11-P23). Specifically, demand from Period 24 to 29 has averaged 68.7 units, significantly lower than the previous high-regime average of ~85 units. Current inventory is healthy: On-hand is 119 units, and in-transit is 150 units (orders from P26, P27, P28). Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are well-covered for the next 5 periods of demand at the current rate (Total coverage = 269 units / ~69 avg demand \u2248 3.9 periods). To avoid excessive holding costs as demand stabilizes at this lower level, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the cooling trend (Avg P24-P29: 68.7). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility (Std Dev: ~8.8), which is lower than the previous regime's volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: 6-period average (P24-P29) is 68.7 units/period, down from the P11-P23 average of 84.6 units. Volatility has also decreased (Std Dev ~8.8 in the last 6 periods vs ~17.6 previously).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 465655019 has stabilized into a secondary regime following a peak. After a significant demand shift starting around Period 11 (averaging ~82 units), the last seven periods (P24-P30) show a cooling trend with a mean of 69.6 units and significantly lower volatility (Std Dev ~7.6) compared to the mid-game peak. The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 114 units, and with 155 units in-transit, the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this cooled demand regime while maintaining a responsive 4-period lead time parameter. This approach balances the need to avoid overstocking during the current cooling phase while remaining protected against the historical volatility of this product.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed: P24-P30 average is 69.6 units/period with significantly lower volatility (Std Dev ~7.6) compared to the P11-P23 peak average of ~85.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a cooling trend from the high-intensity phase observed in Periods 14-23 (~85 units/period) to a more moderate regime. In the last 8 periods (P24-P31), the average demand is 68.9 units/period (79, 77, 63, 59, 57, 77, 75, 64). The standard deviation in this recent window has also significantly decreased to approximately 8.7, indicating much higher predictability. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 81 and in-transit at 203 (total 284), and a lead time of 4, the current pipeline covers approximately 4.1 periods of demand at the new average rate. To maintain a safe stock level while accounting for the lower volatility and avoiding excessive holding costs, I am setting N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this new 'cooled' regime accurately.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 465655019 has stabilized into a 'cooling' regime after the peak observed between Periods 11 and 23. The recent 9-period average (P24-P32) is approximately 65.8 units, which is significantly lower than the previous peak average of ~85. The most recent demand (Period 32) was 51 units, suggesting the cooling trend is sustained. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P28 order arrived in P32 as expected). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture this lower demand regime (P24-P32), which corresponds to (1+4) * ~66 = 330 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=9) to reflect the reduced volatility (Std Dev ~8-10) compared to the height of the demand shift. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed: P24-P32 average is 65.8 units/period with significantly lower volatility compared to the P11-P23 peak average of ~85.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand spiked unexpectedly to 95 units, which depleted the on-hand inventory (ending at 0). However, the arrival from Period 29 (89 units) was expected in Period 33 but did not conclude; this suggests it will arrive in Period 34 (observed in P35). Currently, there are 256 units in-transit according to the status, which correctly accounts for orders from P29 (0 - note: P29 order was 0, but the P25 arrival was 89), P30 (75), P31 (79), P32 (61), and P33 (41). The 'arrived=0' in Period 33 conclude refers to the order placed in Period 29, which was 0 units. Therefore, the pipeline is intact. Demand has been categorized into a cooling regime (P24-P32 avg ~66), but the high demand in P33 (95) and the holiday season context (late September moving into Q4) requires a cautious approach. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the most recent cooling while acknowledging the P33 spike, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the renewed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand showed a sudden spike to 95 in Period 33 after a cooling trend (P24-P32 avg ~66). This may indicate the start of a new upwards regime or increased late-season volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lingerie item (Thong briefs). We are currently in early October (Period 35). Historically, demand for this SKU underwent a significant upward shift in Period 11, peaked in the mid-80s, then cooled to the mid-60s around Period 24. However, Period 33 showed a spike (95) followed by a sharp drop in Period 34 (35), likely indicating high late-season volatility rather than a sustained new regime. The shipment from Period 29 (ordered 0) resulted in no arrival in Period 33, while the Period 30 order arrived correctly in Period 34 (lead time 4). On-hand inventory is 40 units with 273 units in-transit. Given the high volatility (recent demand: 95, 35) and the 4-period lead time, I will use a recent_N approach (N=11, covering the cooling period and the recent spike) to capture current mean demand (~68.5 units/period) while accounting for the recent variance to ensure sufficient stock for potential spikes without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand volatility remains high in the late-season cooling phase; Period 33-34 demand fluctuated from 95 to 35 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655019 (Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p) has entered a late-season phase characterized by significant demand volatility. After a cooling period (P24-P32 avg ~66), demand spiked to 95 (P33) before dropping to 35 (P34) and 36 (P35). This suggests a lower but highly erratic demand regime as we move into October. The post-cooling trend mean (P24-P35) is approximately 67 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, although the order from Period 29 is conspicuously absent (missing 'conclude' message after the expected 4-period arrival window in P33/P34), confirming it as likely lost. Current on-hand (83) and in-transit (214) total 297 units. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat (covering the cooling andRecent volatility phases) to capture the current mean of ~71 units per period, and a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the high recent volatility (Std Dev ~28) to maintain service levels during this erratic phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Period 29 shipment confirmed lost (no arrival message by P35). Demand from P33-P35 (95, 35, 36) indicates high volatility in the late-season cooling regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 37 (2019/10/21). Historically, demand for this SKU was stable at ~40 (P1-P9), spiked to ~85 (P11-P23), then cooled to ~66 (P24-P32). Recent demand (P33-P36) has shown high volatility (95, 35, 36, 49), averaging 53.75 units. The shipment from Period 29 is officially lost (no arrival message by P36). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for all other orders. I will use the recent 4 periods (P33-P36) to estimate demand (mu_hat) to capture this new high-volatility phase, which settles around an average of 54. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the extreme volatility observed recently (standard deviation is roughly 28). This approach ensures enough safety stock to handle spikes like the one in P33 while managing inventory for the lower demand seen in P34-P36.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has shifted again starting P33 (observed values: 95, 35, 36, 49), averaging ~54 units/period but with a high standard deviation (~28) compared to the prior cooling phase.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a highly volatile late-season phase. After a clear cooling period (P24-P32, avg ~66), demand spiked to 95 in P33 and has since fluctuated: 35, 36, 49, 61. The current 5-period average (P33-P37) is 55.2 units, but the high standard deviation (~23.6) suggests we need to maintain a higher safety stock to avoid stockouts like the one seen in P33. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P33 order arrived in P37). On-hand inventory is 75, with 135 in-transit (orders from P34, P35, P36). Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the current lower but volatile demand mean (~55), and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat captures the significant increase in volatility (StdDev ~23) compared to the prior cooling phase. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the reduced volume and the increased risk of spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated in the late-season phase; P33-P37 demand (95, 35, 36, 49, 61) averages 55.2 with a high StdDev of ~23.6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-45.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P33-P38: 95, 35, 36, 49, 61, 61) shows a stabilization around a lower mean compared to the summer peak, averaging 56.2 units per period with a standard deviation of 21.0. This 'late-season' regime is significantly more volatile than the 'cooling' phase (P24-P32) which averaged ~66 with low variance. Lead time is robust at 4 periods, with only one confirmed lost shipment (P29) and one earlier (P5/P11). Given the current on-hand inventory of 106 and in-transit of 109, we are well-covered for the lead time plus review period (5 periods) at the current demand level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this latest volatile stabilization phase while keeping lead time at the promised 'default' of 4.

Carry-over insight: Late-season volatility regime (starting P33): Mean demand has stabilized around 56 units/period (P33-P38) but with significantly higher volatility (Std Dev ~21) than the preceding cooling phase.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context suggests a 'late-season volatility' regime starting around Period 33. Demand over the last 7 periods (P33-P39) has been 95, 35, 36, 49, 61, 61, 41, resulting in a mean of 54.1 and a high standard deviation of approximately 21.0. This is a significant shift from the preceding cooling phase (which averaged ~66) and the mid-season peak (which averaged ~85). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, although a shipment from Period 29 is confirmed lost. My goal is to set parameters that recognize this new lower-mean but high-volatility regime. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition. Setting N=7 specifically targets the 'late-season' behavior observed since the Period 33 spike.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655019 is currently in a late-season phase characterized by increased demand volatility. Since Period 33, demand has fluctuated significantly (95, 35, 36, 49, 61, 61, 41, 26). The mean of the last 8 periods (P33-P40) is ~50.6 with a high standard deviation (approx 21.6), indicating a shift away from the earlier high-demand peak (~85) and the subsequent cooling phase (~65). Period 40's demand of 26 suggests a potential further decline into the winter months. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this recent volatile but lower-mean regime (P33-P40). This will ensure the base stock is adjusted to the current demand level while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. I'll use the default lead time (4) as it has been extremely reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P33 (late-season): Mean demand has decreased to ~51 units/period (P33-P40 avg) but with high volatility (Std Dev ~21).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, late in the year. Demand has entered a late-season regime starting around Period 33, characterized by lower mean demand (~51 units) but significant volatility (Std Dev ~21). The most recent three periods (P39-P41) show even lower demand (41, 26, 27), suggesting a further cooling as we approach the end of the simulation (P47). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, though Period 29 and Period 37 orders (due P33 and P41 respectively) appears lost (no arrival message in the concluding periods). In-transit inventory is 171 units, covering the remaining lead time. Given the high volatility but decreasing mean, I will use a recent window (N=9, covering P33-P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current late-season behavior while maintaining a buffer for potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: Late-season cooling trend confirmed (P39-P41): demand dropped to an average of 31.3 units, significantly lower than the P33-P38 average of 56. Lead time remains 4 periods, but shipments in P29 and P37 are confirmed/likely lost.

=== Period 42 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand spiked significantly to 159 units, which is a major outlier compared to the recent cooling trend (avg ~30-50 units). Given the date (Nov 25), this is almost certainly driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales for this lingerie product. Because the next period starts Dec 2, demand is expected to remain somewhat elevated compared to the early November baseline but likely lower than the extreme peak seen on Black Friday week. However, the system is currently at 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods. The shipment from Period 37 (ordered 0) is non-existent, and the shipment from Period 39 (66 units) is expected to arrive during Period 43 (next observed in Period 44). To prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture the spike's influence without overreacting as if 159 is the new baseline. N=10 captures the end of the cooling phase plus the holiday spike. Tracking the lost shipment from P37 (which was an order of 0) is neutral, but the system must recover from the P42 stockout quickly.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 (Black Friday week) saw demand reach 159 units, significantly higher than the preceding 3-week average of 31.3 units (+400%).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the post-Black Friday and December holiday season. Period 42 showed a massive spike (159 units) for Black Friday, and while Period 43 demand dropped to 50, the upcoming weeks (leading to Christmas/New Year) typically see sustained or elevated demand for lingerie/underwear. On-hand inventory is low (16), and although 180 units are in-transit, recent demand spikes and past lost shipments (P29, P37, and potentially P41) necessitate a cautious approach. I am using a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the recent high-volatility regime (since P33), and I am setting sigma_hat using an explicit value to account for the massive holiday variance seen in P42. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed in Period 42 (159 units). Demand is now in a high-volatility end-of-year regime. Shipment from Period 37 (ordered 0) and Period 41 (expected soon) require monitoring for potential delivery failures.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history has been highly volatile due to the holiday season. A massive spike occurred in Period 42 (159 units, likely Black Friday), followed by a return to more moderate levels in Periods 43-44 (50 and 39 units). Given that we are now in mid-December (2019/12/16), we must account for potential remaining holiday demand volatility while recognizing that the peak has passed for this specific SKU category (cotton thongs). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (7 units) with a significant pipeline in-transit (245 units), including large orders from P43 (127) and P44 (95). Period 29 and Period 37 shipments are confirmed/highly likely lost. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the post-cooling/holiday mix (avg ~61 units/period), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the increased volatility (Std Dev ~50) driven by the Period 42 spike. L is set to 'default' as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand (Black Friday) occurred in P42 with 159 units. Demand in P43-P44 has stabilized at an average of 44.5 units, though volatility remains high due to seasonal effects.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late December period (P46: 2019/12/23). Recent demand history shows a massive Black Friday spike (P42: 159) followed by a stabilization/volatility phase. The most recent period (P45) saw demand jump to 119, likely due to pre-Christmas shopping. With 0 on-hand inventory and a high seasonal demand context, the goal is to set parameters that cover the remaining holiday volatility while preparing for the post-holiday drop. The actual lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand regime from P42-P45 averages 91.75 units (159, 50, 39, 119) with very high standard deviation (~56). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this highly volatile holiday regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the recent 119-unit spike and the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed (P42-P45): Mean demand increased to 91.75 units/period with extreme volatility (Std Dev ~56) driven by peak seasonal events (Black Friday and pre-Christmas).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 (Dec 30), the tail end of the holiday peak for SKU 465655019. Demand have been extremely volatile since late November (Black Friday spike of 159 in P42, followed by a pre-Christmas spike of 119 in P45, and 79 in P46). The current average demand for the holiday regime (P42-P46) is ~89 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 441 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The large order in transit from Period 43 (127 units), Period 44 (95 units), Period 45 (33 units), and Period 46 (186 units) should begin arriving starting Period 47. However, given the Dec 30 date, we must anticipate the post-holiday January demand slump while still protecting against any lingering high demand. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the high holiday average but set L to default (4) to ensure the OR backend covers the full lead-time pipeline. High volatility (StdDev ~56 in the last 5 periods) requires a wide sigma_hat, so I am using recent_N=5 for volatility as well.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition detected: Demand regime P42-P46 averaged 89.2 units with extreme volatility (Std Dev ~50+). Monitoring for January demand drop.
