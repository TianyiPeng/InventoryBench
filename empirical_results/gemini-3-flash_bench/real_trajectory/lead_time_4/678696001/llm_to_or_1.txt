Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'IZZY TEE', a ladies' sports top. The historical data shows a downward trend in demand from early January (289 units) to early February (201 units), with the last 5 weeks averaging 185.4 units. Since this is a sports t-shirt, we are entering the pre-spring/spring season where demand for activewear typically stabilizes or increases. Given the on-hand inventory is 0 and the promised lead time is 4 periods, we need to establish a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use the recent 5-period average (185.4) as the baseline for mu_hat. This targets a service level dictated by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (q \u2248 0.8), allowing the OR engine to buffer appropriately against the observed volatility (std dev \u2248 64).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a sports t-shirt. Historical demand shows a mean of ~185 units/week over the first 5 samples, but Period 1 demand was lower at 136. On-hand inventory is 0, so we lost Period 1 sales. We have 292 units in-transit from Period 1. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, we don't expect arrivals until Period 5 (reported in Period 6). I will use recent_N for demand forecasting (N=5) to capture the initial volatility while ensuring L is set to default. The goal is to build up a base stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (total 5 periods).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's sports t-shirt. Historical data from early January to early February shows mean demand around 185 units. In the last two periods (concluded Period 1 and 2), demand was slightly lower (136 and 143), suggesting a small dip or variance. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 497 units in transit (292 ordered in P1, 205 ordered in P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at the start of P3, no orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected during P5 resolution). Because we have zero stock and have missed sales in P1 and P2, we need to ensure the base stock calculation is robust when the lead time is fulfilled. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent trend including the historical samples, and 'default' for lead time and sigma_hat as we have no evidence yet to deviate from the promised lead time or overall volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). For SKU 678696001 (Izzy Tee), we have zero on-hand inventory and 743 units in-transit. Historically, demand for this item has been: 289, 161, 122, 154, 201 (pre-game) and 136, 143, 93 (in-game). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 4, the initial order from Period 1 is not expected to arrive until Period 5's arrival phase (visible in Period 6). Therefore, all 'arrived=0' messages are expected and do not yet indicate a lead-time shift or lost shipment. Demand seems to be stabilizing at a lower level than the early January peak; the average of the last 5 samples (P-1 to P3) is approximately 145. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this more recent demand level while maintaining the promised lead time L=4 (covering 1 review period + 4 lead periods).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a sports t-shirt (Ladies H&M Sport). Looking at historical data (Jan-Feb), demand averages around 180 units/period (289, 161, 122, 154, 201). In game history (Periods 1-4), demand has been 136, 143, 93, and 158. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (292 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, on-hand is 0, and there is a 800-unit pipeline (orders from P1-P4). The 'sold=0' in history is expected because inventory has not arrived yet. Since we have not yet observed a full lead-time cycle, I will stick to 'default' lead time. For demand, I'll use the average of the last 5 samples from the provided data plus the 4 observed periods (total 9 samples) to forecast 'mu_hat'. Mean of all samples (289, 161, 122, 154, 201, 136, 143, 93, 158) is ~162. With L=4, mu_hat = (1+4)*162 = 810. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the engine use the full history available.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a sports top ('IZZY TEE'), which is beginning to see a spring demand uptick. Demand in the last 5 periods has averaged 144.2 (136, 143, 93, 158, 191), whereas the seed data from January/early Feb showed a higher average (approx 185). Recent demand shows a recovery trend (158 to 191). Lead time for the Period 1 order was exactly the promised 4 periods (arrived Period 5). On-hand inventory is 101, with 623 in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). Given the promised lead time L=4, we must account for (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the last 5 periods of demand data (N=5) to calculate \u03bc\u0302 is most reflective of the current performance in-game, though we acknowledge the slight upward trend in the last two weeks. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover expected demand over the lead time plus review period while balancing the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a sports t-shirt (IZZY TEE). Demand history shows a mean of approximately 161 units per period (samples: 289, 161, 122, 154, 201 before P1, and 136, 143, 93, 158, 191, 152 in P1-P6). The average of all available 11 data points is ~163.6. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on P1 and P2 orders arriving exactly in P5 and P6 respectively. Current inventory is 154 (on-hand) + 483 (in-transit). Since L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Total pipeline coverage needed is roughly 5 * 163.6 = 818. Current coverage is 154 + 483 = 637. The OR backend will calculate the order based on the parameters provided. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the full simulation history (N=6) and 'calculate' for lead time since observed lead times match the promise (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a women's sports t-shirt. Demand analysis shows a gradual upward trend as spring progresses (Avg P1-P4: 132.5; Avg P5-P7: 184.7), likely due to seasonal interest in fitness apparel. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Current on-hand is 189 units with 388 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). Demand is currently averaging ~185 units per week. To account for the seasonal uptick and the 4-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (representing the spring regime) to capture the higher mean (~185). Sigma_hat will also use the same N=3 to reflect recent volatility. L remains default as 4 is confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase observed starting P5: mean shifted from ~133 to ~185 (+39%) coinciding with spring seasonality for sports apparel.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). The product is a sports top for women. We have observed a demand regime shift starting in Period 5 (coinciding with spring), where demand increased from a mean of ~133 to ~185 (+39%). The last four periods (P5-P8) had demands of 191, 152, 211, and 219 (mean: 193). Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (27 units) because the P4 order was small (57 units), and demand has been strong. However, we have a significant pipeline 'In-transit' of 566 units (orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8). A large shipment (115 units from P5) is expected to arrive during the current Period 9, which will be visible in the P9 conclude message. To maintain the service level for the new higher-demand regime, I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the spring sports seasonality trend. Lead time remains at the default (promised) 4 periods as it has proven consistent.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a sports T-shirt (IZZY TEE) currently in the spring season (April). Historical demand analysis reveals a clear regime shift: Period 1-4 showed an average demand of ~133, while Period 5-9 increased to an average of ~186.4. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since Period 9 ended with 0 inventory and a stockout (159 demand > 142 on-hand), and on-hand inventory remains 0 at the start of Period 10, the priority is to maintain inventory levels for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 demand samples (Period 5-9) to capture the higher spring seasonal demand regime. Sigma_hat will also be adjusted using recent history (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility observed during this high-demand period. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current run-rate.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678696001 (IZZY TEE) is currently facing stockouts due to high demand and the 4-period lead time delay. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand shifted upwards around Period 5 (coinciding with spring/sportswear seasonality), though Periods 9 and 10 show a slight moderation (159 and 125) from the peak. I will use a window of 6 periods (P5-P10) to capture this higher-demand regime, resulting in a mean demand of ~176. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Setting L=4 and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods will help the OR engine calculate a base stock sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (865 units) is substantial, so the backend cap will moderate order quantities as arrivals catch up.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29th, 2019. The product is a sports T-shirt, which sees increased demand in spring. Previous demand analysis showed a regime shift at Period 5, but more recent data (Periods 9-11) shows slightly lower demand (avg 135) compared to the Period 5-8 peak (avg 193). However, we experienced stockouts in Periods 9 and 10 which likely suppressed true demand. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is high (800 units), consisting of orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11. I will use a recent_N (N=7) for demand to capture the post-P5 regime while acknowledging the recent dip/stockout noise. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has been consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019/5/06). The product is a sports T-shirt, which saw a demand spike from Period 5 through Period 8 (avg ~185) corresponding with early spring. However, demand in the most recent four periods (P9-P12) has cooled down significantly, averaging approximately 130 per period (159, 125, 120, 115). This suggests the initial spring peak is tapering off. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 151, with 650 units in-transit (P9, P10, P11, P12 orders). To avoid overstocking while the demand cools, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower, more stable demand regime. This resets the forecast to (1+L)*130 \u2248 650, which helps the OR backend decide if additional units are needed beyond the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average demand decreased from 185 to 130 (-30%) as the initial spring surge stabilized.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the product (Ladies H&M Sport Tee) has completed its initial spring surge (Periods 5-8, avg ~185) and has entered a more stable demand regime. Since Period 9, demand has significantly cooled, averaging 110 units over the last 5 periods (159, 125, 120, 115, 82), with the most recent week being the lowest. This suggests that the 'IZZY TEE' is moving past its peak seasonal relevance. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 312 and pipeline inventory at 407 (totaling 719), and expected demand significantly lower than previous months, we have sufficient coverage. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent cooling trend (N=5 covers Periods 9-13). This helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering and incurring unnecessary holding costs for this $1.0/unit item.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), the SKU (a ladies sports t-shirt) is exiting its peak spring season. Historical demand shows a clear shift: Period 5-8 averaged ~193 units, while Periods 9-14 have stabilized at an average of ~114 units (P13 and P14 showing even lower demand around 81-82). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (467) and the pipeline includes 171 units (orders from P11 and P12 totaling 171). The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high stock level and declining demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the post-surge demand level (~114 * (1+4) = 570) and using a matching recent sigma to capture current volatility. This configuration will signal the OR backend that we have sufficient inventory, likely resulting in zero or minimal orders to avoid excessive holding costs as we move further into the season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 9-14 confirm a post-peak average demand of ~114 units/period, down from the spring peak of ~193.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing SKU 678696001 (Izzy Tee, Ladies Sport). This is a seasonal t-shirt that experienced a sharp spring peak (Period 5-8, avg ~193) and has since stabilized at a lower baseline (Period 9-15, avg ~114). The most recent three periods (P13-P15) show a further cooling of demand to an average of ~81 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high current on-hand inventory (474 units) and an incoming shipment of 85 units (total pipeline 559), the current stock covers nearly 7 periods of demand at the recent rate (~81 units/period). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the post-peak stability since Period 9 while acknowledging the downward trend. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a standard safety buffer. The inventory level is currently very safe, and we have refrained from ordering for the last three periods to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at lower levels: Periods 13-15 show a consistent decline to ~81 units/period, down from the earlier post-peak average of ~114.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a sports t-shirt (Ladies H&M Sport). We are currently in early June (Period 17). Demand has significantly cooled after a spring peak in March/April. Recent demand (P13-P16) has settled into a stable range: 82, 81, 79, 73, averaging approximately 79 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently high (486 units) following the arrival of large orders placed during the peak period. Given the current average demand (~79) and a lead time of 4 periods, we need covers for (L+1) = 5 periods, which is approximately 395 units. Since on-hand (486) + in-transit (85) = 571 units, we are significantly overstocked. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) to capture this lower stable regime, and default for lead time as it remains consistent at 4 periods. The goal is to allow the high on-hand inventory to deplete toward the new lower base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level: Periods 13-16 show a consistent average of ~79 units/period, down from the previous post-peak average of ~114.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a sports T-shirt. Demand has significantly cooled off following the spring peak. Recent demand samples (P13-P17) are 82, 81, 79, 73, and 52, showing a clear downward trend and stabilization at a much lower level than earlier periods. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 73 units/period, compared to the peak average of ~193. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Currently, there is an inventory surplus (On-hand: 434) relative to this new demand regime (434 / 73 \u2248 6 periods of coverage). The OR backend must be configured to account for this lower demand to avoid further overstocking, as the current stock alone exceeds the base stock level for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent demand normalization.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level: Periods 13-17 show a consistent average of ~73 units/period (a 36% decrease from the previous post-peak average of ~114).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678696001' (Izzy Tee, a sports top) continues to show a significant decline in demand as the peak spring season ends and we move into late June. Demand in the last two periods (P17: 52, P18: 51) is substantially lower than the previous six-period average (P11-P16: ~92). The current on-hand inventory (383) plus the pending in-transit shipment (85) totals 468 units. Given the most recent demand level of ~50 units per period, this stock covers over 9 weeks of demand, which is well beyond the replacement cycle of 5 periods (L+1). Consequently, the OR backend will correctly calculate a zero order requirement. To ensure the backend uses the most relevant data for its base stock calculation, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6, encompassing the regime post-period 12 where demand shifted downward. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new baseline: Periods 17-18 show demand dropping to ~52 units/period, down from the previous stabilization level of ~73. This represents a ~30% further decline as spring seasonality fully exits.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (IZZY TEE, a sports t-shirt) is continuing its post-spring descent in demand. Moving into late June (Period 20), the demand over the last three periods (P17-P19) has averaged 48.7 units (52, 51, 43), confirming the shift described in the Period 19 carry-over insight. Inventory levels are currently very high (On-hand: 340) relative to this new demand baseline. With a promised and confirmed lead time (L) of 4, the target pipeline (L+1=5 periods of cover) would be approximately 244 units (5 * ~49). Current Total Inventory (340 + 85 = 425) significantly exceeds this requirement. Therefore, no new orders should be placed, and the parameters are set to reflect the most recent demand regime (N=3) to prevent the OR backend from over-ordering while the system draws down existing stock. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new low-season baseline: Periods 17-19 show an average of ~49 units/period, a significant reduction from the earlier ~73 units level as summer progresses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-330.00

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678696001' (Ladies Sport T-shirt) is currently in a low-season demand regime as summer progresses. The most recent demand (Period 20: 19 units) suggests a further decline beyond the previously established baseline of ~49 units. We are currently overstocked with an on-hand inventory of 406 units, which is significantly higher than any projected demand for the (L+1) period window. The holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0 favors lean inventory in a declining market. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (Periods 17-20) where demand has averaged approximately 41 units (52, 51, 43, 19). Setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to adjust to this cooling demand and prevent further unnecessary ordering while the existing stock is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Demand dropped to 19 units, bringing the 4-period average (P17-P20) to ~41 units, confirming the continued exit from spring/summer peak seasonality.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/08. Demand for the 'IZZY TEE' (a sports t-shirt) has continued its steep decline as we move further into the summer, confirming a low-season baseline. The demand for Period 21 was only 15 units. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has been 52, 51, 43, 19, and 15, showing a clear downward trajectory towards a very low floor. The current on-hand inventory is 391 units with zero in-transit, providing extremely high coverage (roughly 26 weeks at current demand levels). Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, the OR backend targets a service level of 0.80. Given the excessive stock, no new orders are required. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the most recent downward trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the confirmed lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Demand dropped to 15 units, with the last two periods (P20-P21) averaging 17 units. This confirms a significant off-season trough for the sports t-shirt compared to the previous stabilization level of ~41 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a ladies' sports t-shirt (IZZY TEE) currently in a deep off-season trough as of mid-July. Demand has plummeted from over 200 units during the spring peak to just 9 units in the most recent period (P22). Specifically, actual demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) has been 51, 43, 19, 15, and 9, showing a consistent and severe downward trend. The current on-hand inventory of 382 units is extremely high relative to these sales volumes (over 20 weeks of coverage at current rates). The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and declining demand, I will set mu_hat to be based on the most recent 3 periods (average ~14 units) to prevent the OR backend from triggering any unnecessary orders. N=3 is chosen to capture the most recent 'trough' regime (P20-P22).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: Demand dropped to 9 units, bringing the 3-period average (P20-P22) to ~14 units, confirming a deep off-season trough.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-372.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (IZZY TEE) is currently in a deep off-season trough as we enter late July. Demand has collapsed from a spring peak of ~200 units to just 2 units in the most recent period (P23). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P20-P23) is approximately 11 units, which is a significant drop compared to the previous stabilization level of 41 units recorded in P21. We have a substantial on-hand inventory of 380 units, which, at current demand rates, represents over 30 weeks of supply. Given that the holding cost is $1.00 per unit/period (a 1:4 ratio compared to profit), it is critical to prevent any further ordering and allow the existing inventory to be consumed. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods captures this deep trough, ensuring the base stock level remains far below our current on-hand inventory, thus suppressing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Demand hit a seasonal low of 2 units, bringing the 4-period average (P20-P23) to ~11 units, confirming a near-total collapse in demand for this sports top during the mid-summer period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Izzy Tee' (a sports T-shirt) is in a deep seasonal trough. Demand has collapsed from a spring peak of ~193 units to a current average of only ~2 units over the last two periods (P23-P24). The on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 378 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 189 periods of the current demand levels (378 / 2). With no in-transit units and a lead time consistently observed at 4 periods, there is absolutely no need to order more. The goal is to aggressively minimize holding costs. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 5 periods (P20-P24, average demand ~10 units), the base stock calculation will result in a value much lower than the current inventory + pipeline, ensuring the OR backend places zero orders until the excess stock is depleted or demand recovers significantly.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer seasonal trough confirmed: demand has collapsed to near-zero levels (avg ~2 units/period over P23-P24), resulting in a massive inventory surplus (378 units).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678696001' (wide sports top) is currently in a deep seasonal trough during mid-summer (early August). Recent demand observations for Periods 23-25 are 2, 2, and 4 units respectively. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 374 units, which is far beyond any foreseeable demand in the near term given the current avg of ~3 units/period. The calculation of base stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302 will result in a value significantly lower than the current inventory (on-hand 374 + in-transit 0), so the OR backend will naturally correctly place zero orders. To ensure the backend doesn't over-order based on old historical averages from the spring peak, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (approx. 6 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a deep seasonal trough (mid-August), with demand for the 'IZZY TEE' sports top dropping to 0 units in the most recent period and averaging only ~2 units/period over the last 4 periods (P23-P26). On-hand inventory is extremely high at 374 units, which at the current depletion rate will last for many years, far exceeding any reasonable stock level. There are no orders in transit. To maximize profit and minimize holding costs, we must prevent any further ordering. I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat (N=4) to reflect the current near-zero demand regime (~1.5 units/period) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=4) to account for the collapse in volatility. Given the massive inventory surplus, the OR backend's capped policy will ensure no new orders are placed as the base stock will be significantly lower than the current on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a absolute floor at Period 26: demand dropped to 0, confirming the completion of the seasonal exit; average demand P23-P26 is 1.5 units/period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678696001 (Ladies Sport Tee) is currently in a deep off-season trough during late August (P28, 2019/8/19). Demand has effectively collapsed, with the last five periods (P23-P27) recording values of 2, 2, 4, 0, and 5 units respectively (avg ~2.6 units/period). The current on-hand inventory is 369 units, which is vastly in excess of any projected demand for the foreseeable future, even accounting for the 4-period lead time. There are no units in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the lack of sales, the objective is to prevent any further ordering until this surplus is cleared. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this near-zero demand state accurately. The OR backend will see the high on-hand inventory relative to the low base_stock and correctly place zero orders.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a deep seasonal trough (late August). Demand for this ladies' sports top has effectively bottomed out, with the last six periods (P23-P28) showing a total demand of only 19 units (average ~3.2 units/period). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 363 units, which is enough to cover over 100 periods of current demand. My primary goal is to avoid any new orders to minimize holding costs while the current excess inventory slowly depletes. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods to reflect this low-demand regime, and keep L at the default promised lead time of 4. Given the huge inventory surplus, the OR backend's base-stock calculation will result in zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor confirmed: Periods 23-28 show an average demand of 3.2 units/period, maintaining the seasonal trough observed since mid-summer.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678696001' (Izzy Tee) is currently in a deep seasonal trough as of September 2, 2019. Historical demand over the last 7 periods (P23-P29) has consistently remained between 0 and 6 units, averaging approximately 3 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 361 units with zero in-transit shipments. Given the low holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0) but extremely low current demand, the priority remains clearing the massive inventory surplus accumulated during the spring-summer transition. I am setting L to 'calculate' based on consistent historical delivery at 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current low-demand regime (P23-P29), ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand inventory, thus preventing any new orders until the surplus is resolved.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Periods 23-29 show a stable off-season floor with an average demand of 3.0 units/period and very low volatility (sigma ~2.3).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The product is a ladies' sports t-shirt which has experienced a severe seasonal decline starting mid-summer. We are currently in a stable off-season trough. For Periods 23-30, daily demand has averaged approximately 3.25 units with very low volatility. With 356 units on-hand and an average demand of ~3 units per period, we have over 100 periods of supply, which far exceeds any requirements for the promised 4-period lead time. No new orders are needed. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders due to historical high-demand data from the spring, I will use recent_N to isolate the current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=8 (the duration of the current trough from P23 to P30) ensures parameters reflect the current state (mean ~3.25).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678696001 (IZZY TEE) is currently in a deep off-season trough, which is typical for a lady's wide sports top entering mid-September. Demand has been extremely low and stable for the last 9 periods (P23-P31), averaging approximately 3.6 units per period with very low volatility. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 350 units and no units in transit. Given the current average demand, this inventory is sufficient to cover nearly 100 periods, far exceeding the projected demand for the remainder of the game (47 periods total). Holding costs ($1.0/unit) are high compared to the potential profit ($4.0/unit), thus the priority remains on depleting the existing surplus rather than ordering more. I will maintain the mu_hat and sigma_hat settings at 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this stable, low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend sees no need to place new orders. The base stock level calculated from these parameters will be significantly lower than the current inventory + pipeline, resulting in an order of 0.

The SKU '678696001' (Izzy Tee) is currently in a deep off-season trough. Current date is Sep 23, 2019. Historical data shows demand has stabilized at extremely low levels since mid-July (Period 23). In the last 10 periods (P23-P32), the average demand is ~3.6 units per period. We have 346 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given that the profit/holding cost ratio suggests a high service level (0.80), but we already have approximately 96 periods of supply on-hand based on the recent average, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to reflect this stable off-season floor (P23-P32). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Off-season floor sustained: Periods 23-32 show an average demand of 3.6 units/period with very low volatility, confirming a continued deep seasonal trough through September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (IZZY TEE, a short-sleeved ladies' sports top) is clearly in its deep off-season trough as we enter October (Period 34). Demand has consistently averaged approximately 3.9 units per period since Period 23, with low volatility. Currently, there is a massive inventory surplus of 339 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given that there are only 13 periods remaining in the simulation, and the projected total demand for the rest of the game is approximately 52 units (13 weeks \xd7 4 units/week), the existing inventory is more than sufficient to meet all future demand. No new orders are needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (tracking the stable trough period P23-P33) for demand and 'calculate' for lead time to ensure the OR backend accurately reflects the current low-demand environment and prevents further ordering.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a wide sports top (ladies' fast-drying functional fabric), which experienced heavy demand during the spring (late Feb-April) but has since entered a deep seasonal trough. On Period 35 (2019/10/07), the demand remains extremely low, averaging 4.5 units per period over the last 12 periods (P23-P34). Current on-hand inventory is 337 units, which at the current burn rate is sufficient to cover more than 70 periods of demand. No new orders are needed. The OR backend should be configured with parameters reflecting this stable, low-demand regime to prevent any erroneous procurement. Using N=12 for demand parameters captures the stabilized off-season baseline perfectly while ignoring the high-demand spring data.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678696001 (Wide sports top) is currently in a deep off-season trough as we enter mid-October. Demand has remained consistently low since Period 23 (July), with an average demand of approximately 3.7 units per period over the last 13 periods (P23-P35) and a standard deviation of about 2.2. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 334 units, while the expected demand for the next 5 periods (Lead time 4 + 1 review period) is only around 18-20 units. This results in a massive inventory surplus that will likely last several months until a potential late-winter or spring resurgence. No new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 13 periods to reflect this stable, low-demand floor and prevent the system from over-ordering while we liquidate the excess stock. Lead time remains stable at its promised value of 4.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678696001 (Wide sports top) is currently in a deep off-season trough, which has been sustained since mid-summer (roughly Period 23). The most recent period (P36) saw a demand of 2 units. Over the last 14 periods (P23-P36), the average demand is 3.14 units per period with very low volatility. With an on-hand inventory of 332 units and a pipeline of 0, the current stock covers over 100 periods of demand at the current rate. The holding cost is $1.00/unit/period, while profit is $4.00/unit; therefore, minimizing the inventory surplus is the priority. I will continue to set the OR parameters to reflect this low-demand regime to ensure no new orders are placed. I am using recent_N=14 to capture the stability of this off-season floor.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product (Ladies Wide Sports Top) remains in a deep seasonal trough that began in mid-summer (Period 23). For the last 15 periods (P23-P37), average demand has been extremely low (~3.4 units/period). On-hand inventory is 329 units, which is enough to cover current demand levels for nearly 100 periods. Since the game ends in Period 47 (9 periods away), there is no need to place any more orders. My objective is to minimize further holding costs while satisfying the very low remaining demand. I will continue to use recent_N (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this off-season floor to ensure the OR engine recognizes the massive surplus and does not place new orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies Sports T-shirt) is in a deep off-season trough, with demand consistently below 10 units since Period 22 (July). The current date is November 4th, and recent history (Periods 34-38) shows an average demand of 2.2 units per period with minimal volatility. There is an extremely large inventory surplus of 328 units on-hand, which is sufficient to cover over 100 weeks of current demand levels. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs and given the current pipeline is empty, no new orders are necessary. I will maintain the L at 4 (promised) and use recent_N (N=10) to reflect the stable, low-demand environment, allowing the OR backend to calculate a minimal base stock, which will result in zero orders due to the high on-hand balance.

The SKU 678696001 is currently in a deep off-season trough, which has been sustained since mid-July (Period 23). Current demand averages approximately 3.4 units per period with very low volatility. With an on-hand inventory of 326 units and zero units in transit, the system has a massive inventory surplus (over 90 periods of cover at current rates). No new orders are needed. I will set the demand parameters using a recent_N approach (N=17) to accurately represent the current low-demand regime (Periods 23-39). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with historical observations.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Wide sports top) is currently in a deep off-season trough, which has been sustained since Period 23 (mid-July). Period 40 demand was 3 units, and the average demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) is approximately 2.9 units per period. On-hand inventory is 323 units, which is vastly in excess of any foreseeable demand before the game ends in Period 47 (approximately 100x the current weekly demand). Therefore, no new orders are needed. I will continue to use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to reflect the current stable low-demand regime (mu_hat approx 14.5 for L=4), ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock level well below the current on-hand inventory, resulting in zero orders.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). The product is a wide sports top (IZZY TEE), which has experienced a sustained seasonal trough since mid-summer (Period 23). For the last 19 periods (P23-P41), demand has averaged 3.1 units per period with very low volatility. We are currently holding 323 units on-hand with zero in-transit, which is more than enough to cover demand for the remaining 6 periods of the game (approx. 18-20 units total). The holding cost is $1.0/unit, so the priority is to avoid any further ordering to minimize holding costs while the existing stock naturally depletes. I am using 'recent_N' with N=19 for mu_hat to capture this stable off-season floor (average 3.1 * (1+4) = 15.5) and sigma_hat to reflect the low volatility. This will ensure the base_stock calculation remains well below the current inventory (323), resulting in zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Extended off-season trough confirmed: Periods 23-41 show a stable average demand of 3.1 units/period with minimal volatility (sigma ~2.1) through October and November.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019 (Period 43). The product is a sports t-shirt, which is currently in an extended off-season trough. Analysis of the demand history from Period 23 through Period 42 shows a consistently low and stable demand regime, averaging 3.1 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 2.1. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 319 units, which is more than enough to cover the remaining 5 periods of the game (43 to 47), even if demand were to triple. Given the $1.00/unit/period holding cost versus $4.00 profit, and the fact that we are nearing the end of the year/game without evidence of a winter sports spike for this specific 'short cap sleeve' item, the priority remains minimizing holding costs by not ordering further units. I will use the established low-demand statistics (N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat) and maintain the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019. This SKU (Ladies Sport Wide Top) has been in a deep seasonal trough since mid-summer (Period 23), with average demand consistently around 3 units/period and very low volatility. On-hand inventory is 318 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate and the remaining 4 periods in the game (318 units / 3 units/period \u2248 106 periods of supply). No orders are in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The priority is to avoid any further procurement to minimize holding costs, as on-hand stock far exceeds any possible demand before the game ends. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for lead time.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). The product, a sports tee, has been in a sustained off-season trough since Period 23 (mid-July). Demand over the last 20+ periods has averaged approximately 3 units per period with very low volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 317 units, which is enough to cover over 100 periods of the current demand level. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (Periods 45, 46, and 47), the objective is to minimize holding costs while ensuring remaining demand is met. Given the massive inventory surplus, no new orders are required. I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent low-demand regime to prevent the OR engine from triggering unnecessary orders, although the high on-hand inventory relative to the pipeline base stock will naturally result in zero orders anyway.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. The product is a wide sports top (Ladies H&M Sport). We are currently in a long-standing seasonal trough that has persisted since late July (Period 23). For the last 23 periods (P23-P45), the average demand is 3.2 units/period with very low volatility. On-hand inventory is 309 units, which is enough to cover over 90 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the 'Wide sports top' description, it is a spring/summer item; however, even if demand begins to recover in early 2020, the current inventory surplus is massive. No orders are necessary. I will maintain the parameters to reflect the current stable off-season regime to ensure no further orders are triggered by the OR backend.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the very end of the year. The product is a wide sports top (Ladies H&M Sport). Historically, this item saw high demand in the spring (reaching a peak mean of ~193 units/period) and then steadily declined through summer into a deep off-season trough starting around Period 23. Over the last 20+ periods (since October), demand has stabilized at a very low baseline, averaging approximately 3 units per period. The most recent three periods (P44-P46) showed a slight uptick (1, 8, 7 units), likely related to year-end sales or New Year fitness resolutions, but the overall mean remains very low. Most importantly, the current on-hand inventory is 302 units, which is enough to cover over 100 periods of current demand. Therefore, no additional orders are required. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture the persistent low-demand regime while allowing for the recent minor variation, and keep L at default since lead time has been stable at 4.
