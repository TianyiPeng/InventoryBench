Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 507883009 (Women's Underwear). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (124, 168, 190, 183, 99) shows an average of 152.8 units per week. The most recent week (99 units) suggests a potential dip, but given the product category, demand is likely to remain relatively stable. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no on-hand or in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the full recent history while calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine accounts for the (L+1)=5 periods of demand coverage required before the first shipment arrives.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is women's underwear. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) are: 124, 168, 190, 183, 99. In Period 1, observed demand was 112. The mean demand across these 6 samples is roughly 146. Promised lead time (L) is 4. In Period 1, 218 units were ordered (now in-transit), but since OH inventory was 0, all 112 demand units were lost sales. To calculate parameters: L = 4. Mu_hat should cover (1+L) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (the most recent samples: 168, 190, 183, 99, 112) gives an average of 150.4 per period. Thus, mu_hat = 150.4 * 5 = 752. Sigma_hat will use the same N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Ellen Thong' (Women's Underwear). On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the lead time delay (promised L=4). Demand for the last two periods was 112 and 169, which is relatively consistent with the pre-game samples (124, 168, 190, 183, 99). The mean of the 5 pre-game samples is ~153, and the mean of the 2 in-game samples is ~140. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture a representative recent window including both historical and current demand. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4 periods, as we have no evidence yet to suggest it has drifted.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Women's Lingerie (3pk underwear). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods and we have only concluded 3 periods. The first order (placed Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Demand for the last 5 samples (124, 168, 190, 183, 99) and the first three game periods (112, 169, 136) shows a mean of approximately 147.6. Recently (last 4 samples: 183, 99, 112, 169, 136), the mean is 139.8. Given the product type, there isn't a massive seasonal spike expected in early March, though February typically sees higher lingerie interest. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current trend and default settings for lead time and sigma_hat until actual lead time is observed. Total pipeline (658) is already significant, and the OR backend will cap orders based on the 1+L cycle (5 periods of demand ~ 700-750).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is women's lingerie (underwear 3pk). Historical demand samples are 124, 168, 190, 183, 99. Observed demand since game start (Periods 1-4) has been 112, 169, 136, 123. The mean demand across all 9 samples is approximately 144.8. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 5 (arrived=X, ordered Period 1, lead_time=4). However, as of Period 5 start, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 699 units in-transit (orders from P1=218, P2=220, P3=220, P4=41). Because profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (z=0). Currently, we have a significant pipeline (699 units). I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the game's actual demand volatility and 'default' for lead time since we haven't confirmed a deviation from the promised 4 periods yet.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is women's underwear. Historic demand samples (Jan-Feb) were [124, 168, 190, 183, 99]. Game history demand (Feb-Mar) is [112, 169, 136, 123, 83]. The average demand across all 10 samples is 138.7. The recent trend (last 3 periods) shows a slight decline (136, 123, 83), but we must remain robust as inventory just started arriving. In Period 5, the Period 1 order arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 4 periods. On-hand is 135, and in-transit is 481 (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4), which is substantial compared to the current demand levels. Since lead time is 4, we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the long-term mean of ~139, mu_hat should be around 695. With 135 on-hand and 481 in-transit (total pipeline = 616), the OR backend will place a small order to bridge the gap and maintain the service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime while filtering out the very high Jan spikes, as the recent trend is lower.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is women's underwear. Historical demand samples (Weeks 1-5) were 124, 168, 190, 183, 99. Observed demand in the game (Periods 1-6) has been 112, 169, 136, 123, 83, 135 (Mean \u2248 126.3). There are no clear seasonal spikes yet. Promised lead time is 4 periods; actual lead times for orders from Period 1 and Period 2 were both exactly 4 periods, confirming the lead time is stable. Currently, on-hand inventory is 220 and in-transit is 268 (total pipeline = 488). With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 126.3 \u2248 631.5. Current pipeline coverage (488) is slightly below this, but the OR backend's cap mechanism will regulate the order size. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the game's actual realizations, and 'calculate' for lead time since the promised 4 periods is being met.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is 'Womens Lingerie' (Underwear). We have observed lead times for 3 orders (Periods 1, 2, and 3), all of which arrived exactly in 4 periods, confirming the promised lead time L=4. Demand history shows some volatility but no clear seasonal trend yet in early spring (Samples: 124, 168, 190, 183, 99 pre-game; 112, 169, 136, 123, 83, 135, 90 in-game). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7) is 113.4 units/week. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the mean demand. Pipeline inventory is currently 192 (orders from P4, P6, P7), and on-hand is 350. The OR backend will use the provided L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to maintain the base stock level. I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time as the 4-period lead time is stable and demand shows a slight cooling compared to initial Jan/Feb peaks.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods across three consecutive arrivals (P1, P2, P3 orders).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Ellen Thong (Malva) L 3pk' is a staple lingerie item. The current date is April 8th. Analysis of the 13 available demand samples (5 pre-game + 8 in-game) shows a relatively stable mean of approximately 132 units per week with a standard deviation of 35. Recent demand in the last 4 periods (83, 135, 90, 101) averages 102 units, which is slightly lower than the overall mean but within normal variance for this category. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. Currently, on-hand inventory is 290 units and in-transit is 176 units (ordered in P6, P7, P8). Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. My targets reflect the stable demand regime while acknowledging the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which suggests a balanced service level (target q=0.5). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the full in-game window which aligns with a stable period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's lingerie item (Ellen Thong). Promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Periods 1-4 confirm that the actual lead time is indeed consistently 4 periods (arriving in Periods 5-8). Arrival for the Period 5 order was 0, but since the order quantity for Period 5 was 0, this is normal. Demand over the last 5 samples (99, 112, 169, 136, 123) has transitioned to a lower regime in the most recent 5 concluded periods (83, 135, 90, 101, 67), averaging approximately 95 units per week compared to the earlier average of ~150. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the system target service level is 50%, meaning we should aim to hold just enough for expected demand. With L=4, the backend needs a forecast for 5 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent lower volume, and recent_N=5 for volatility (sigma_hat) to account for the current demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 5 onwards: average weekly demand decreased from ~150 to ~95 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders in P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6. A significant demand regime shift was noted starting around Period 5; the initial demand mean (pre-P5) was approx 144 units, while the recent mean (P5-P10) is approx 91 units. Following this shift, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new demand behavior for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The product is a pack of underwear, which typically has steady demand but has seen a reduction here. On-hand inventory is 168 plus 297 in-transit, which is relatively high compared to current weekly demand (~91), so the OR backend should naturally moderate ordering using these parameters.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-29. Historical demand data and carry-over insights indicate a significant demand regime shift starting around Period 5 (2019-03-11). Before Period 5, demand averaged ~150 units; from Period 5 to 11, the average dropped to 91.3 units (83, 135, 90, 101, 67, 62, 93). Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple arrivals (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7). Order P5 (0 units) and P8 (25 units) are accounted for or pending. Order P9 (128 units) is expected to arrive in Period 13. My on-hand inventory is 219, and in-transit is 153. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a 50% service level (Profit $1 / Holding $1), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture the lower demand regime since Period 5.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a 3-pack of women's underwear (Ellen Thong Malva). Previous 'Carry-over Insights' confirmed a demand regime shift starting around Period 5, coinciding with a seasonal drop from ~150 to ~95 units. However, Period 12 saw a sudden spike to 157 units, which may be related to early May retail activity or a holiday. Regarding lead time, the system is consistently delivering at 4 periods (as confirmed in P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, and P12). Order placement from P9 (128 units) is expected to arrive in P13 (Current), and will be visible in the next P14 conclude message. Current inventory (On-hand: 87 + In-transit: 207 = 294) must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the recent spike in P12, I will use a recent_N (N=8) to capture both the shifted lower mean and the recent volatility, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the potential return to higher demand while remaining sensitive to the post-February drop.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of women's underwear. Inventory and lead times are stable. The carry-over insights correctly identified a lead time of 4 periods and a demand regime shift starting from Period 5. Observing the demand history from Period 5 to Period 13: 83, 135, 90, 101, 67, 62, 93, 157, 83. The mean of these 9 samples is approximately 96.8 units per period, which aligns with the previous insight of ~95. The spike in Period 12 (157 units) corresponds to late April/early May, but has since subsided in Period 13 (83 units). Regarding lead time, arrivals for orders placed in P6, P7, P8, and P9 have all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods, confirming the L=4 assumption. Current 'In-transit' is 232, consisting of orders from P10 (0), P11 (0), P12 (79), and P13 (153). I will use recent_N to capture the post-shift demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=9, covering Period 5 to 13) and keep the lead time at the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is women's underwear (3pk). As noted in the carry-over insights, a demand regime shift occurred around Period 5, where weekly demand dropped from ~150 to ~95 units. Since Period 10, demand has been relatively stable with a slight uptick in Period 12 (157), but generally remains under 100. Lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P4 and P6-P9). In-transit inventory is high (352 units), which likely includes orders from Period 12 (79), 13 (153), and 14 (120). The zero arrival in Period 14 is expected because no order was placed in Period 10. To avoid over-ordering given the high pipeline (352) relative to the lower demand regime (avg ~95/week), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the mean demand of the current regime. This covers Periods 5-14.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ellen Thong (Malva) L 3pk', a women's lingerie staple. Current date is late May (Period 16). On-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 15, resulting in lost sales. Lead time is stable at 4 periods according to historical arrivals (most recently P13 conclude confirmed P9 order arrived in 4 periods). Since Period 5, demand has settled into a lower regime. The average demand of the last 11 samples (P5 to P15) is 95.8 units with a standard deviation of 27.2. Using N=11 (Recent_N) captures this sustained regime shift. The in-transit pipeline (410 units) includes orders from P11, P12, P13, P14, and P15. An arrival from P11 (144 units ordered but P10 order was 0) is expected to arrive during Period 16, which will resolve the stockout. I am setting L to 'default' (4) as actual lead time matches promised, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=11 to reflect the current demand level and volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's lingerie with a promised lead time of 4 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by historical arrivals (Periods 5-8 and 10-13, 16). Demand transitioned in Period 5 from a higher level to an average of approximately 95 units per week (Periods 5-16 mean \u2248 95). However, we are currently facing a stockout situation (Ending inventory was 0 in P15 and P16) due to missed arrivals in Periods 14 and 15 (Orders from P10 and P11 are missing). Period 10 was zeroed out, but Period 11 saw an order of 144 that arrived in P15 according to standard LT; checking history, Period 14 (P10 order) and Period 15 (P11 order) actually arrive in those periods' execution. Wait, looking at history: P10 ordered 0, P11 ordered 0. P12 ordered 79 and arrived in P16 (LT=4). This explains the stockout: zero orders in P10-P11 led to no arrivals in P14-P15. We have 396 units in transit (P13: 153, P14: 120, P15: 58, P16: 65). The next arrival is expected in Period 17 (from P13: 153 units). I will use recent demand history (N=12, from the regime shift in P5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Ellen Thong (Malva) L 3pk' is currently experiencing stockouts (Period 15-17) due to recent demand spikes, likely related to seasonal patterns as we enter June. Demand in Period 17 jumped to 177 units, significantly higher than the post-Period 5 average of ~95. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P12 order arrived P16, P13 order arrived P17). The current pipeline of 322 units includes orders from P14 (120), P15 (58), P16 (65), and P17 (79). The P14 order is expected to arrive in the current Period 18 and be visible in Period 19. With on-hand at 0 and the latest demand at 177, there's a risk of continued stockout until the P14 order clears. To address the increased variance and prevent future stockouts while demand remains high (summer seasonality for lingerie/undergarments), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recent high demand (avg of P14-P17 is ~111, but P17 was 177) using a 5-period average (recent_N=5) to capture the trend change without over-penalizing for the single 177 peak. Lead time is set to default (promised 4) as it has been stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/seasonal spike detected: Period 17 demand (177) is significantly higher than the previous 10-period average (~95). Stockouts occurred in P15, P16, and P17 due to pipeline delays and insufficient buffer for this volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant demand surge, likely due to a mid-year seasonal peak. Recent demand values are 177 (P17) and 201 (P18), compared to the previous average of ~95. This has led to cumulative stockouts from P15 to P18. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 377 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. To recover from stockouts and meet this new demand level, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use recent_N=3 (capturing the start of the spike while maintaining some stability) and increasing sigma_hat to recent_N=5 to account for the heightened volatility. The base stock calculation must now provide enough coverage for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) at this elevated demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand spike confirmed: Periods 17 and 18 show demand (177, 201) at >100% above the P10-P16 average (~95). Recommended monitoring for a new high-demand regime or seasonal peak duration.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Ellen Thong (Malva) L 3pk' is currently experiencing a sustained high-demand regime or seasonal peak. Demand over the last three periods (P17: 177, P18: 201, P19: 203) is significantly higher than the previous average (~95), resulting in consistent stockouts despite arrivals. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since we have observed 3 consecutive periods of this high-demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new mean (avg ~194). Given that demand for this product (underwear) during June can be volatile and we are seeing a rising trend, I will set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the risk of further spikes and the current 100% stockout rate, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to recover from the deficit and meet the elevated demand across the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime/seasonal spike confirmed: Period 17-19 demand averaged 193.7 units, a >100% increase over the P10-P16 average (~95). Stockouts have persisted for 5 consecutive periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Ellen Thong (Malva) L 3pk' is currently experiencing a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 17 (early June). Demand over the last four periods (P17-P20) has been consistently high: 177, 201, 203, and 216, averaging 199.25 units. This is a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~95. Stockouts have occurred for six consecutive periods because on-hand inventory levels (arriving from orders placed 4 weeks ago) were based on the old, lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address the current stockout and the new demand level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new average of ~200 per week. Over the (L+1) horizon of 5 weeks, this corresponds to an explicit mu_hat of ~1000. For sigma_hat, I'm using the last 4 periods to capture the recent volatility, providing a sufficient safety buffer for the backend to calculate a higher base stock. The pipeline inventory (725 units) is being tracked, but we need more to cover the 1000-unit expectation for the lead time horizon.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (Period 17-20): Weekly average increased from ~95 to ~200 (+110%). Sustained stockouts (P15-P20) indicate base stock needs aggressive adjustment to the new mean.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507883009' (Womens Underwear) is in a significant high-demand regime that began in Period 17. Demand has increased from a historical average of ~95 (P10-P16) to an average of ~206 over the last five weeks (P17-P21). Current data points follow an upward trend: 177, 201, 203, 216, 233. There have been persistent stockouts since Period 15 because the orders arriving were based on the previous lower demand regime (~95). Stock on-hand remains at 0, with 872 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To recover from stockouts and match the current demand level, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly account for a 210 units/week forecast over (L+1)=5 periods (210 * 5 = 1050). Using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat captures the increased volatility during this spike (std dev approx 21).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P17-P21 average is 206 units/week, showing a steady upward trend peaking at 233 in P21. Previous regime (P10-P16) was ~95 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $175.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 17. The demand has shown a steady upward trend, reaching 263 units in Period 22, with a recent regime average (P17-P22) of 215.5 units/week. This represents a significant shift from the previous regime of ~95 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since P15, we have faced persistent stockouts because the pipeline inventory (ordered during the low-demand regime) was insufficient to meet the sudden surge. As of Period 23, on-hand inventory is 0, but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 875 units (comprising larger orders placed in P19-P22). To recover from the stockouts and align with current demand levels, mu_hat is set using the most recent 6 periods (N=6, covering P17-P22) to capture the new mean of ~215 units. This will lead to a base stock target that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, approximately 1075 units. With 0 on-hand and 875 in-transit, the OR engine will trigger an order to bridge this gap while the cap prevents excessive over-ordering if the trend stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P17-P22 average is 215.5 units/week, continuing the upward trend (P22 reached 263). This confirms a sustained peak or high-demand shift significantly above the P10-P16 average of 95.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507883009' (Womens Lingerie) is currently experiencing a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 17 (early June). In Period 24, we are coming off a 6-period stockout streak (P15-P21), which ended in P23 with an arrival of 251 units and an ending on-hand inventory of 87. Historical demand from P17nd onwards (7 samples): 177, 201, 203, 216, 233, 263, 164. The mean of this recent regime is approximately 208 units per week. Although P23 demand (164) was lower than P22 (263), it remains significantly above the previous 'normal' of ~95. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the objective to maximize profit (q = 0.5), I will use the last 7 samples to define the current regime. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 will allow the OR backend to target a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of this elevated demand (roughly 5 * 208 = 1040 units total pipeline inventory).

Carry-over insight: Established high-demand regime P17-P23: mean demand is 208 units/week (standard deviation ~35), a 118% increase over the P10-P16 baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883009 (Womens Underwear) has undergone a significant regime shift. Between Period 17 and Period 22, demand surged to a peak of 263, averaging ~208 units, which led to a series of stockouts. However, in the most recent two periods (P23 and P24), demand has decelerated to 164 and 109 units respectively, suggesting the peak of the seasonal or promotional spike has passed. On-hand inventory has recovered to 198 units as large orders from the high-demand phase (P19-P20) have arrived. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the cooling demand, I will transition from the hyper-aggressive high-demand mean to a slightly more moderate recent average to avoid over-ordering and high holding costs, while still maintaining a buffer against the volatility seen in the last 8 periods. I'm using N=8 for mu_hat (covering the entire high-demand event and the recent cooling) and N=8 for sigma_hat to capture the high variance of this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling: Following the P17-P22 peak (avg ~215), demand in P23-P24 has dropped to an average of 136.5 units, suggesting the high-demand regime is subsiding.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883009 is currently cooling after a significant peak (P17-P22). During that peak, demand averaged ~215 units/week. Over the last three periods (P23-P25), demand has stabilized at a lower level with values of 164, 109, and 123 (average: 132). The carry-over insights confirm this cooling trend. Since we have shifted out of the massive peak but are still above the old baseline (P10-P16 avg: 95), I will use the last 3 periods (P23-P25) to set a more realistic demand forecast for the current 'post-peak' regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) allows the model to adjust downwards from the extreme peak while remaining responsive to the current stabilized demand level, preventing excessive inventory accumulation as the high season/cycle ends.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: P23-P25 demand (avg 132) is significantly lower than the P17-P22 peak (avg 215), indicating the conclusion of the high-demand regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently transitioning out of a high-demand peak (Periods 17-22, avg ~215) back into a more stable, lower-demand regime. Demand over the last four periods (P23-P26: 164, 109, 123, 106) averages 125.5 units, significantly lower than the peak but slightly higher than the Period 10-16 baseline (~95). We have successfully replenished on-hand inventory (373 units) with substantial in-transit orders (377 units) still arriving from the high-order phase (P23-P25). Given the current on-hand plus in-transit stock totals 750 units, and the expected demand over (L+1=5) periods is roughly 625-630 units, we are well-covered. To avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs as demand cools, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this cooling trend (average 125.5 * 5 = 627.5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: P23-P26 demand (avg 125.5) represents a ~42% drop from the P17-P22 peak (avg 215), establishing a new post-peak baseline higher than the pre-peak average of 95.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883009 (Womens Lingerie) has clearly cooled following extreme volatility/peak between Periods 17 and 22. In the most recent 5 periods (P23-P27), demand has stabilized around a mean of 119.6 units (164, 109, 123, 106, 96), which is lower than the peak (~215) but slightly higher than the pre-peak baseline (~95). On-hand inventory is currently high (480 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak period. With a lead time of 4 periods and a weekly mean demand around 120, the pipeline+on-hand target (L+1 demand) should be approximately 600 units. Currently, on-hand (480) + in-transit (174) = 654 units, meaning we are already slightly over-stocked for the new demand level. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this post-peak stabilization and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility, allowing the inventory level to naturally drift down without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: New stable demand regime confirmed (P23-P27): Average demand has settled at ~120 units/week, down from the P17-P22 peak of ~215, but remaining elevated compared to the P10-P16 baseline of 95.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the SKU 507883009 (Women's Underwear) is currently in a post-peak stabilization phase. After a significant high-demand regime from Period 17 to Period 22 (averaging ~215 units/week), demand has cooled significantly. In the last six periods (P23-P28), demand values were 164, 109, 123, 106, 96, and 57. The average for this recent window is approximately 109 units/week, with the most recent observation (57) being the lowest in many periods, possibly signaling further cooling or a return to the pre-peak baseline (~95). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (550 units) following the arrival of orders placed during the peak. This inventory level already covers over 5 periods of average demand at the new regime rate. Given that the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture the stabilized lower demand (N=6, average ~109), and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility compared to the peak. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed and stable (P23-P28): New average demand is ~109 units/week, down from peak of ~215. Period 28 demand (57) suggests potential return to original P10-P16 baseline (~95).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime (P17-P22, avg ~215) has clearly concluded. Since Period 23, demand has leveled off, with the most recent data (P28-P29: 57, 87) suggesting a return to the original pre-spike baseline (P10-P16, avg ~95). Current on-hand inventory is 510 units with zero in-transit, which is significantly more than enough to cover the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Specifically, at the current estimated mean of ~100 units/week, 5 periods of demand equals 500 units. Given the high on-hand stock and the cooling demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 7 (covering P23-P29) to reflect this lower demand environment accurately while allowing the OR backend to realize that supply exceeds the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Demand has returned to pre-spike levels; Period 23-29 average is 103 units, with the last two periods (57, 87) averaging 72 units. The high-demand peak is fully subsided.

The demand for SKU 507883009 has successfully transitioned out of its high-demand peak (P17-P22, avg ~215) and has now stabilized. Over the last 8 periods (P23-P30), the average demand is 111.6 units. The most recent demand (P30) was 144, but the average of the last three periods (P28-P30) is 96, aligning closely with the pre-spike baseline of ~95. With on-hand inventory at 366 units and 20 units in-transit (ordered P30), the current stock covers over 3 periods of stabilized demand. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this post-peak stability (P23-P30) while allowing the OR backend to normalize stock levels against the lower demand mean.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883009 has stabilized following a large seasonal spike that occurred between Periods 17 and 22. In the last period (P31), demand was 125 units, and the average over the last five periods (P27-P31) is approximately 101.8 units. This confirms the 'carry-over insight' that demand has returned to a level closer to the pre-spike baseline, though slightly more volatile. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 241 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent overstocking as we exit the peak season while maintaining service levels for the new baseline, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=9 captures the period from P23 to P31, which represents the entire post-peak 'cooling' and stabilization phase. This provides a representative mean (~110 units) and variance for this current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-43.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand spike observed between Periods 17 and 22 has definitively subsided. In the last tight window (P23-P32), the average demand is 119.8 units. The most recent three periods (P30-P32) average 122.6 units, which is slightly higher than the pre-spike baseline of ~95 but significantly lower than the peak average of ~215. The system currently has 142 units on-hand and 321 units in-transit (orders from P30, P31, P32). Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, these arrivals will begin in Period 34. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the new stabilized demand of ~120 units/week, I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat (covering the post-peak stabilization period) and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility without being skewed by the massive P17-P22 spike. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike stabilization (P23-P32): Demand has settled into a new regime averaging ~120 units/week, approximately 25% higher than the initial P10-P16 baseline of 95.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883009 (Women's Underwear) is recovering from a recent demand spike. Period 33 show a significant demand jump to 201 units, which depleted the remaining on-hand inventory (starting at 142). This followed a period of relative stability around 120 units post-summer peak. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. However, there is a large pipeline of 413 units (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the 20 units ordered in P30 are expected to arrive in the current Period 34 (arrival resolution), and the 166 units from P31 will arrive in P35. To bridge the current stockout while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) seen in the last 11 periods (P23-P33), I am using the recent_N method. Specifically, N=11 covers the entire post-peak stabilization period, capturing both the mean of ~121 units and the high standard deviation caused by the P33 spike. Setting L to the confirmed 4 periods ensures the base stock calculation covers 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Continued high volatility in post-peak regime; Period 33 demand spike (201) caused a stockout despite stabilization efforts. Pipeline of 413 units is expected to resolve stockout starting Period 34.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) following a demand spike in Period 33 (201) and Period 34 (158). However, a large in-transit pipeline of 576 units is active. Period 34 saw the arrival of the Period 30 order (20 units), confirming that lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The next major arrival (ordered in Period 31, 166 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of the current period (Period 35), which will alleviate the stockout. Demand has shown high volatility recently (99, 201, 158), suggesting the post-peak regime (P23 onwards) has a higher mean and variance than the initial baseline. I will use recent_N=12 to capture demand behavior from the start of the cooling phase (Period 23) to the current period to better estimate the new average and volatility (approximately 125 units/week) without being overly reactive to single outliers.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P23-P34) confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized around 125 units/week, significantly higher than the pre-spike basement of 95, with increased volatility (bursts >200).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883009 appears to be in a post-peak stabilization phase (P23-P35) with a mean demand of approximately 125 units per week. While the primary peak (avg ~215) has subsided, recent demand shows significant volatility, including a jump to 201 units in P33 and 158 in P34, causing temporary stockouts. The inventory has partially recovered with 166 units arriving in P35, but on-hand stock remains low at 29 units. I am setting L to 4 as lead times have been consistent. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 13 periods (P23 to P35) to capture this new regime's mean (~125) which is higher than the original baseline. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance observed in this stabilized phase compared to the very early periods of the game.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the post-peak regime (P23-P36) is currently averaging 123.6 units per week. Although there was a significant spike in P33 (201) and P34 (158), the most recent demand points (P35: 137, P36: 111) suggest a return to this stabilized mean of ~125. The current on-hand inventory is 53, with a healthy pipeline of 454 units (orders from P33, P35, P36 are expected in P37, P39, P40 respectively). The order from P33 (92 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 37 resolution phase (ordered P33, lead time 4), which will help replenish the low on-hand stock. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 14 periods (P23-P36) to capture this post-spike stabilization level, and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the residual volatility seen in P33 and P34 without over-reacting to the cooling of the last two weeks.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883009 has stabilized into a post-peak regime (starting around Period 23). Over the last 15 periods (P23-P37), the mean demand is approximately 124.5 units per week, with a standard deviation of 40.5. Recent demand in the last three periods (P35-P37) has been 137, 111, and 121, staying close to this mean. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (24 units), but the pipeline is strong (469 units), with the P34 order (183 units) expected to arrive in Period 38 (L=4). Therefore, I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture this stable post-peak regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at default (4). This balance ensures sufficient stock to handle the regime's volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $207.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a 'post-peak' demand regime characterized by a mean of approximately 125 units but high volatility, as evidenced by recent spikes (P33: 201, P38: 208). Period 38 ended with a stockout (0 units on hand) despite an arrival of 183 units, confirming that demand currently exhausts available inventory quickly. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is 406 units (orders from P35, P36, P37, P38), which are expected to arrive in P39, P40, P41, and P42. Given the stockout and persistent high-demand bursts, I will maintain mu_hat at the post-peak mean of 125 (totaling 625 for 1+L periods) and use a recent_N window for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of the last 10 periods (P29-P38), ensuring the OR engine maintains an adequate safety stock to prevent further stockouts during this volatile stabilization phase.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak volatility confirmed: Demand shows significant spikes (P33: 201, P38: 208) despite a lower mean of ~125, requiring higher safety stock buffers than the pre-spike regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a post-peak demand regime that began around Period 23, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 125 units but with significant volatility (spikes over 200 in P33 and P38). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and a pipeline of 561 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 35, the demand has been: 137, 111, 121, 208, 98. The average over these last 5 periods is 135. Given the high volatility observed in the 'Post-peak' era (P23-P39), I am using a recent_N of 17 for mu_hat to capture the entire post-peak behavior (P23 to P39) and a recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to specifically account for the recent increase in volatility (including the P33 and P38 spikes). This approach ensures we maintain a sufficient buffer for the sporadic high demand weeks while acknowledging the stabilized mean.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a post-peak demand regime (starting around Period 23) where the average demand has stabilized at approximately 125 units/week, which is higher than the initial baseline but subject to high volatility (e.g., Period 38 saw 208 units). Current on-hand inventory is low at 39 units, but the pipeline is healthy at 489 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5. To manage the observed volatility and avoid further stockouts (which occurred in P38 and P39), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the post-peak period P23-P40) to capture the current mean of ~125. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=18 to ensure the OR engine recognizes the increased variance (standard deviation) present in this regime compared to the very early periods.

=== Period 41 Summary ===
507883009: ordered=97, arrived=107 units (ordered on Period 37, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=146, demand=65, sold=65, ending on-hand inventory=81

Daily Reward (R_t): $-16.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a 'post-peak' volatile demand regime (P23-P41), where the average demand is approximately 125 units with significant spikes over 200 (P33: 201, P38: 208). Most recently (P39-P41), demand has been slightly lower (98, 103, 65), averaging 88.6 units, but given the historical tendency for sudden spikes in this category (Women's Lingerie/Underwear), I must maintain a buffer. Since Period 34, lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 81 with 479 units in-transit. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the post-peak mean (~120-125) which accounts for both the spikes and the lulls, and a recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to ensure the safety stock covers the observed high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak regime (P23-P41) average demand is 123.5 units, with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation ~45) compared to the pre-spike baseline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883009 is currently in a post-peak demand regime (P23-P42). Recent demand (P41: 65, P42: 110) has cooled slightly below the post-peak average of ~123 units, but the segment is characterized by high volatility, with spikes exceeding 200 units (P33, P38). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent consistent arrivals (P34-P38 orders arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 91 with 450 units in transit. To prevent stockouts during volatile bursts while avoiding excessive holding costs (which are $1.0/unit), I am setting mu_hat based on the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the post-peak mean of approximately 123.5 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=20) to reflect the significantly higher volatility observed in this regime compared to the early periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-185.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a post-peak demand regime (starting Period 23) with a mean demand of approximately 123.5 units and high volatility (spikes >200 as seen in P33 and P38). Currently, the date is December 9th, which is squarely in the peak holiday shopping season for womens lingerie/underwear. Demand in Period 43 was unusually low (49 units), likely a pre-holiday lull or noise, but given the seasonal context, demand is expected to remain firm or potentially spike again before the end of the year. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 234 units on-hand and 323 in-transit, the pipeline is relatively healthy. I will use a recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak regime characteristics (mean ~120, higher volatility) while ignoring the extreme summer spike. This ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer for holiday season volatility while accounting for the current elevated baseline compared to early-year levels.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 507883009 (Womens Underwear) shows a post-peak stabilization regime following the significant summer spike (P17-P22). Since Period 41, demand has slightly softened (65, 110, 49, 67), averaging 72.75 units over the last 4 periods, which is lower than the long-term post-peak average of ~125. However, mid-December often precedes holiday-related volatility or year-end shifts in demand for basics. The 'In-transit' inventory of 302 units combined with 237 units 'On-hand' provides a total coverage of 539 units. With an estimated lead time of 4 periods (consistent across history), we need to cover demand for Period 45 plus the 4-period lead time (5 periods total). Given the recent lower demand, a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=10 (covering the period since early October) will capture the stabilized mean (~100 units/week) while 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=10) will capture the sustained high volatility (SD \u2248 45) observed in the post-peak months. This ensures we don't over-order based on the summer peak while maintaining a safety buffer for the recurrent spikes seen in P33 and P38.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed in December (P41-P44): average 72.8 units/week compared to P23-P40 average of ~125.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. We are in a confirmed demand softening phase during December. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 71.2 units (65, 110, 49, 67, 65), which is significantly lower than the previous post-peak average of ~125. On-hand inventory is 269 units and pipeline is 205 (ordered P42-P44). With a lead time of 4 periods, we need enough inventory to cover the next 5 periods. Total demand for 5 periods at the current mean (~72) is approx 360 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 474 units, which is already sufficient for about 6.5 periods. To avoid high holding costs ($1/unit) during this lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand trend (N=5) and lead time remains calculate (stable at 4). This will likely result in a zero or very small order for this period.

Carry-over insight: December demand softening confirmed (P41-P45): average demand dropped to ~71 units/week, a ~43% decrease from the P23-P40 post-peak average of 125.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-258.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the SKU 507883009 (Women's Underwear) is currently in a seasonal 'softening' phase typical for December. Looking at recent data (P41-P46), the demand mean has dropped to approximately 68 units/week (65, 110, 49, 67, 65, 51), significantly lower than the post-peak average of ~125. On-hand inventory is high at 309 units following recent arrivals. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns. To avoid building excessive inventory during this low-demand period while maintaining coverage (L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower holiday-season mean of ~68 units of demand per week (Total mu_hat \u2248 340). Sigma_hat is also updated using the same window to reflect current volatility. No new order is likely necessary given existing pipeline and high on-hand stock.
