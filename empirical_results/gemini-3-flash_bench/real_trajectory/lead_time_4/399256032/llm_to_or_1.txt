Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Womens Everyday Collection' ankle-length jeans. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from 51 units (Jan 7) to 145 units (Feb 4), likely driven by the transition from winter into the spring shopping season. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, though the OR backend's capped policy will manage stock levels against mean and variance. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the strong recent trend, I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the accelerating growth (average of 75, 99, 145), rather than the full history mean. I will use the default promised lead time and calculate volatility based on the most recent 3 periods to account for the increasing demand variance.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a pair of women's skinny ankle jeans. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a clear upward trend: 51, 64, 75, 99, 145, 113. The dip to 113 in Period 1 (after a peak of 145) suggests the initial burst might be stabilizing or slightly seasonal, but the overall mean has significantly shifted from the early January levels. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the last 4 samples (99, 145, 113) provides a better estimate of the current 'high' regime than the full history. The order placed in Period 1 (165 units) is in-transit and expected around Period 5. On-hand is currently 0, so we have lost sales. I will use recent_N to capture the higher demand level and explicit L to match the promised lead time of 4.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is February 25, 2019. The SKU is a pair of women's skinny ankle jeans, a stable item but currently experiencing a significant upward demand trend based on historical samples (P1: 113, P2: 124, preceded by historical growth from 51 up to 145). We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory and 322 units in transit (ordered in P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 weeks. Since P1's order was placed in Period 1, it is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4) and become visible in the Period 6 decision phase. Demand is currently higher than the historical mean, showing a 'regime shift' towards higher spring volume. To ensure we cover demand for the lead time (4) + current period (1) = 5 periods, and accounting for the recent acceleration (avg of last 5 historical samples + 2 actual periods is ~110), I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture this growth and 'default' for lead time and sigma until we observe actual arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 2019: Weekly demand increased from ~60 to ~120 units (+100% growth).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a women's skinny ankle jean, which shows a significant demand shift since early February (moving from ~60 to ~110 units/week). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced stockouts because initial orders are still in transit (promised lead time is 4 periods). The first order placed in Period 1 (165 units) is expected to arrive during the 'arrival resolution phase' of Period 5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6. The current in-transit pipeline (477 units) covers the estimated demand for the next few periods. I am setting L to 'default' (4) as we have seen no completed arrival cycles to suggest otherwise. For mu_hat, I'm using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the higher demand regime observed in Feb/March (approx 110/week) vs the Jan baseline (approx 60/week), resulting in a forecast covering 5 periods (L+1). Sigma_hat 'recent_N' is used to account for the increased volatility of this new regime.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a women's skinny ankle jean. We are currently experiencing a stock-out (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline (in-transit: 595). Historical demand data and 'conclude' messages show a demand regime shift starting in February, where demand jumped from a pre-February mean of ~67 to a February/March mean of ~105. Specifically, the last four 'conclude' periods (Periods 1-4) show demands of 113, 124, 94, and 94. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are at the start of Period 5, we expect the order placed in Period 1 to arrive during Period 5 (visibility in Period 6). Effectively, we have 4 periods of demand to cover before the first order arrives. My mu_hat calculation uses a recent_N of 4 to capture this higher February/March demand (~106 avg), and the backend multiplies this by (1+L) = 5. I will maintain L at default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead-time drift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-31.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 analysis: The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday' skinny ankle denim. Historical demand shows a regime shift in early February, moving from a mean of ~73 (Jan) to ~98 (Feb/Mar average). The current on-hand inventory is 98, with 430 units in transit. The first order (placed P1) arrived in P5 with a lead time of 4 periods, confirming the promised lead time. However, the system had 0 stock during periods 1-4, causing lost sales. Using the most recent 5 samples (113, 124, 94, 94, 67) gives a mean of 98.4. My mu_hat forecast is (1+L)*mean = 5 * 98.4 = 492. Given in-transit is 430 and on-hand is 98 (pipeline=528), and the OR backend's cap mechanism, an 'explicit' mu_hat of 550 is set to ensure we maintain a buffer, accounting for the recent demand volatility and the need to recover from the stockout period. Sigma is calculated based on the recent 5-week standard deviation (~21.8) scale by sqrt(5).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Demand stabilized at a higher mean of ~98 units/week since Feb 2019 compared to Jan 2019.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-65.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees consistent demand in early spring. Historically, demand shifted from ~72 units/week in January to a higher regime since February. In the last 6 periods, demand has averaged ~98 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 5 and 6 concludes), matching the promised 4 periods. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (1+L)=5 periods. The current on-hand (160) and in-transit (273) total 433 units. Using a recent_N (N=6) approach for demand captures the current regime (Feb-Mar) more accurately than including the lower January values. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=6) which reflects the 98 units/week mean * 5 periods (~490). sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=6) to capture current volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a women's skinny ankle jean. Looking at the history, the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand has been relatively stable since the February jump, with the last 7 periods (P1-P7) averaging 102.8 units. The most recent demand was 133, suggesting a potential spring uptick. Since we have orders pending from P4 (118 units) and P7 (57 units), our in-transit pipeline (175) plus on-hand (182) equals 357 units. With lead time L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 7 periods of demand data (N=7) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat accounts for the post-January regime shift while smoothing out recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the 5-period horizon.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is in a stable post-Feb demand regime. Historical demand since 2019-02-04 (Period 0 equivalent) has been: 145, 113, 124, 94, 94, 67, 95, 133, 106. The mean of these 9 samples is approximately 108 units per week. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (confirmed for P1 through P4 orders). On-hand inventory is 194, and pipeline inventory is 197 (orders from P7 and P8), totaling 391. With a lead time of 4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 9-period mean of 108, the expected demand over (L+1) is 540. The current 391 units cover ~3.6 periods, indicating a need for additional orders to reach the base stock target. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time and using the recent 9 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime after the initial Jan-Feb spike.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256032' is an 'Everyday Collection' ankle-length jean with fairly stable demand. Analyzing historical demand since the Feb 2019 regime shift (P1 to P9), the average weekly demand is approximately 101 units (113, 124, 94, 94, 67, 95, 133, 106, 81). The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 21.0. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, and P8 arrivals all showed L=4). Although P9 showed 0 units arrived, this is consistent with the order gap in P5 (when 0 units were ordered). Therefore, I maintain L=4. For mu_hat, I use N=9 (covering the post-Jan regime) to capture the current mean of ~101 units/week, scaled for (L+1)=5 periods, totaling 505. For sigma_hat, I use N=9 to capture recent volatility (~21 units/week), scaled by sqrt(5). This ensures sufficient base stock to cover demand during the lead time and the review period while managing the holding cost against a 1-to-1 profit/holding ratio.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019-04-22). The product is 'Skinny Ankle Jeans', which typically sees stable demand in spring. Historical demand analysis shows a shift to a higher mean starting Feb 2019 (~98 units/week). Recent demand (Periods 9-10) has cooled slightly to ~78 units/week, but the overall mean since the Feb shift is approximately 98.2 units/week with a standard deviation of 22 units. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (arrived consistently at L=4 for the first four orders). Orders from Period 5 and 6 were 0 units, meaning we expect no arrivals in Periods 9/10 (confirmed) or Period 11 (this period). The next arrival is expected in Period 12 (from Period 7 order of 57 units). Current on-hand is low (37), and pipeline is 391. With an expected lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I am using recent_N=10 to capture the stabilized regime since February and will use recent_N for both mean and volatility to adjust for the slightly lower recent demand while maintaining the buffer for the confirmed higher regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a staple women's skinny ankle jean. Looking at the history, actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P11). In P11, the order from P7 arrived exactly as expected (57 units, L=4). However, orders from P5 and P6 (which were 0 units) resulted in no arrivals in P9 and P10, leading to the current low on-hand inventory of 20 units. Demand since the Feb/March shift has stabilized: the average demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 98. Similarly, the demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is approx 88. Based on the seasonal context (late spring), demand for ankle-length denim should remain steady. I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat to capture the post-January regime while maintaining enough sample size for stability, and stick with L=4 based on historical consistency.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistency confirmed at 4 periods across 5 separate arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P4, P7 orders).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' ankle-length jean. Demand shifted in February 2019 to a higher level and has since stabilized. Over the last 8 periods (Period 5 to 12), the mean demand is approximately 91.8 units/week with a standard deviation of about 21 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (all observed arrivals had an actual lead time of 4). At the start of Period 13, on-hand inventory is 75, and there is a robust pipeline in-transit (321 units) consisting of orders from Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12. Since lead time L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent stable regime (N=8) captures the current demand mean and volatility more accurately than the full history, which includes the lower-demand January period. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost, targeting a service level near 50% (q = 1/(1+1)).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399256032 (Ankle-length jeans) shows a distinct regime shift that occurred in February, where demand jumped from a weekly mean of ~70 to ~100. However, the most recent 5 periods (Periods 9-13) show a slight cooling of demand, averaging 76.4 units per week, which is more aligned with the late spring season for this product type. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on several arrivals (the most recent being Period 9's order arriving in Period 13). On-hand inventory is 156 with 227 units in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, P13). To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (76.4 * (1+L) = 382) to reflect the recent stabilization. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent period to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~76 units/week over the last 5 periods (April-May), down from the ~100 units/week observed in Feb-March.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (May 20, 2019), we observe that demand has continued to settle into a lower regime. The last five periods (P10-P14) show demands of 76, 74, 85, 66, and 58, averaging ~72 units/week, which is a significant drop from the ~100 units/week seen in Feb-March. This reflects the 'Ankle-length jeans' product entering a post-spring stabilization phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the P10 order arriving exactly 4 periods later in P14. Currently, on-hand inventory is 145 and in-transit is 180 (from orders in P11, P12, P13). Total pipeline (325) is substantial relative to the current demand mean of 72. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a service level where profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), target inventory should cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this recent lower demand regime and use the default lead time (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: May demand mean is ~72 units/week, down from April's ~80 and March's ~100.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late May 2019. Historical data and recent demand trends (Periods 11-15) show that demand for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans has stabilized at a lower level compared to the February-March peak. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (N=5) is approximately 69.8 units/week (74, 85, 66, 58, 65). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 144 and pipeline at 150, the total stock (294) is relatively high compared to current demand. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) captures this stabilized lower demand regime, helping to avoid over-ordering and minimizing high holding costs ($1/unit) while maintaining a sufficient service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower regime of ~70 units/week during May 2019 (Periods 11-15), confirming the downward shift from the ~100 units/week observed in early Q1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-47.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' is a women's everyday jeans staple. Current date is June 3rd, 2019. Historically, demand shifted from an average of ~100 units/week in early Q1 to a lower, stabilized regime of ~73 units/week over the last 6 periods (Periods 11-16). Specifically, the last 4 periods show demands of 66, 58, 65, and 80 (mean = 67.25). The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current inventory position is 127 (on-hand) + 141 (in-transit) = 268 units. Given the stabilized demand around 73 units, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 365 units. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging ~73 units/week). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the recent volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256032' (Women's Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a stable demand regime after a downward shift in May. Over the last 7 periods (Periods 11-17), the average weekly demand has been ~72 units. The most recent demand (Period 17) was 65 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, which aligns with the promised value. Currently, On-hand is 115 and In-transit is 177. Total protection (On-hand + Pipeline) is 292 units, covering roughly 4 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the stable demand and consistent lead time, I am using a recent window (N=7) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining the promised lead time of 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 ensures the base stock reflects the current stable regime of ~70-75 units per week.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256032' (Women's Skinny Ankle Jeans) has shown a demand slowdown since May 2019. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), weekly demand has averaged 63.8 units (58, 65, 80, 65, 51), significantly lower than the ~100 units/week observed in early Q1. The current date is mid-June, and while summer fashion can be unpredictable, the confirmed downward shift to a regime of ~65-70 units per week remains the most actionable data. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. We set L to default (4) and mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this lower May-June regime while smoothing out minor fluctuations like the P16 spike (80). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to ensure volatility estimates reflect the current lower-demand variance rather than the high-volatility Q1 period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 20 (June 24). The product is 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans. Historical demand shows a significant decline: from ~100 units/week in Feb-Mar to ~75 in Apr-May, and further decreasing in June (the last three weeks recorded demand of 65, 51, and 33 units). The most recent demand (33) suggests a cooling interest or seasonal shift for this specific denim cut. On-hand inventory is 65, with 242 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P15 order arrived in P19). Given the downward trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the June slowdown (avg ~58) while maintaining safety. L is set to default (4). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed in June: Weekly demand dropped to an average of ~50 units (Periods 17-19), continuing the decline from May's ~70. This reflects a transition into summer seasonal behavior for this product.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', currently entering July (high summer). Demand has consistently declined from ~100 units/week in early spring to approximately 28-33 units in the last two weeks (Periods 19-20). This significantly confirms a summer low. Total pipeline inventory (On-hand 91 + In-transit 188 = 279) is quite high relative to the current demand regime of ~30-40 units/week (covering ~7-9 weeks). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (covering June) to capture this downward trend and prevent over-ordering while maintaining a cautious buffer. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the lower volatility of the current low-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed: Demand dropped to ~30 units/week in late June (Periods 19-20), representing a 70% decrease from the February-March peak.

The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', currently in early July. Demand has seen a significant and sustained drop through June into July, reaching a trough of 20-33 units/week. This aligns with a summer seasonal low for denim products as consumers shift toward summer-specific apparel. Mean demand over the last 3 periods is ~27 units/week. Based on historical data, the previous regime (May) was ~70 and (June) was ~50. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this new lower regime (approx 30 units/week) to avoid over-ordering and incurring high holding costs, given that on-hand inventory (160) already covers several weeks of this low demand. L is set to explicit=4, consistent with all recent confirmed deliveries. Recent demand volatility is relatively low, so sigma_hat will be calculated based on the last 5 periods to capture this stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues into July: Weekly demand has averaged ~27 units over the last 3 periods (P19-P21), confirming a deep summer trough for this SKU.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' (trousers), which has experienced a significant seasonal demand decline as of mid-July 2019. Demand has dropped from a peak of ~100 units/week in Q1 to a summer trough averaging ~27 units/week over the last three periods (P19=33, P20=28, P21=20, P22=33). Current on-hand inventory is 188 units and in-transit is 38 (from P19), totaling 226 units. With a demand forecast of ~27 units/week, the current total pipeline covers over 8 weeks of demand, well beyond the 5-week (L+1) coverage target. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1 (q=0.5), the target inventory level should be approximately the median demand. Oversupply is the secondary risk here; I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (N=4) to prevent excessive ordering while the on-hand stock is depleted by the summer sales rate.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256032' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a summer demand trough in July. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) has been 33, 28, 20, 33, and 58. While P23 showed a slight uptick to 58, the average of this recent regime is approximately 34.4 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high at 168 units with no units in transit. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an expected demand of ~35-40 units/week, the current stock of 168 units is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 weeks of sales (35 * 5 = 175). Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), maintaining excess inventory is penalized heavily. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the summer trough and capture the slight recent increase, ensuring the OR backend sees the reduced requirement and avoids placing unnecessary new orders while on-hand stock is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the summer trough (July), averaging ~34 units/week over P19-P23, despite a minor uptick in P23.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Ankle-length jeans' is currently in a summer demand trough. Demand in Period 24 was very low (12 units), following a minor spike in Period 23 (58 units). Over the last 6 weeks (Periods 19-24), the average demand is 30.6 units, confirming the 'summer trough' insight. On-hand inventory is 156 units, which is high relative to current demand levels (covering approximately 5 weeks of demand at 31 units/week). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand plus pipeline inventory currently at 160 units, and the backend logic targeting a (L+1) horizon (5 weeks), the current stock levels are sufficient. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current trough while acknowledging the volatility observed in the last two weeks. Sigma_hat will also be set based on this recent regime to reflect current demand variability.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early August (Period 26). Historical data and carry-over insights indicate a significant summer demand trough, with demand averaging approximately 31 units per week over the last 7 periods (P19-P25). The most recent demand was 30 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 126 units, which is roughly 4 weeks of supply at the current low demand rate. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, meaning we should avoid excess inventory that incurs holding costs equal to potential profit. No arrivals are expected for the next few periods (pipeline inventory is only 4 units). The current on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover the (L+1) period demand horizon (estimated at ~155 units for 5 weeks) with minimal risk, especially since demand has been trending low. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the summer average, and using default for lead time as 4 periods remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough continues: Demand averaged ~31 units/week throughout July (P21-P25), confirming a sustained seasonal low period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256032' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently at the end of its summer trough (mid-August). Demand over the last 8 periods (P19-P26) has averaged 30.1 units/week, significantly lower than the H1 average. We have 101 units on hand and 27 units in-transit (from P24 and P26). With a lead time of 4 periods, total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 128 units, which covers over 4 weeks of current demand. However, as we approach late August and September (Back-to-School season), demand for 'Everyday Collection' denim typically shifts upward from summer lows. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 8 to capture the current low-demand baseline while maintaining sufficient sigma to handle potential late-August demand volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The focus is currently on the transition from the deep summer trough into the late-August period. Historically, July and early August demand has stayed low, averaging ~30 units/week. However, as we approach late August (Back-to-School season for denim and ankle jeans), we anticipate a gradual return to higher demand levels. The most recent demand (P27) was 34 units, slightly above the July floor. On-hand inventory is 67, with 49 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we are at the tail end of the summer trough but anticipate a seasonal recovery in late August/September, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=7 (covering the summer period P21-P27) to capture the current baseline while allowing for the base stock calculation to stabilize inventory. I will maintain a standard sigma_hat for volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26), transitioning from the summer trough into the early autumn retail season. Historically, demand for these ankle-length jeans peaked in February/March (~100 units/week) and fell to a summer low in June/July (~30 units/week). Recent demand (Periods 23-28) shows a slight recovery: 58, 12, 30, 25, 34, 38. The mean over the last 5 periods is approximately 32 units, but the last two weeks (34 and 38) suggest a slow upward trend as customers prepare for the transition out of summer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (Period 24 order arrived in Period 28). Current on-hand is low (33), and in-transit (81) includes orders from Periods 26, 27, and 28. To avoid stockouts as the seasonal shift begins while managing high holding costs ($1/unit), I will use a recent_N window (N=6) for demand forecasting to capture the current trough's end and a slightly elevated sigma to account for the potential start of back-to-school/autumn demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Early signs of recovery from summer trough: Demand in P27-P28 (avg 36) is slightly higher than the July avg (31). Monitoring for autumn seasonal uptick.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Historical data shows a significant summer trough (July/August) with demand averaging ~30 units/week. However, the end of August (P28-P29) and the start of September typically signal a seasonal recovery for 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' as fall shopping begins. Demand in P28 was 38, indicating a slight upward creep from the summer floor of ~12-25 units. Since we are entering September, I expect demand to revert toward the spring mean (approx 60-70 units) rather than staying at the summer low. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 8) and pipeline inventory is 132. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to project a conservative recovery mean of 50 units per week across the lead time + review period (5 periods), totaling 250 units, to prevent stockouts during this transition. Sigma_hat is set to 15 (explicit) to account for increasing volatility during seasonal shifts, totaling 33.5 for 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal transition: Monitoring for autumn recovery in 'Womens Everyday Collection' jeans. Early P28 signal (38 units) suggests exit from the summer trough (avg 31).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019). The SKU is 'Womens Everyday Collection' ankle-length jeans. Historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high peak in Feb/Mar (~100 units/week), a steady decline through May/June, and a summer trough in July/August (~30 units/week). As we enter September, we expect an autumn recovery. Demand in P30 was 30 units, and the avg of P27-P30 is 31.75. However, we anticipate a rise similar to the pre-peak levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (1 unit) with 184 units in transit. Specifically, orders from P27 (22), P28 (36), P29 (51), and P30 (75) are expected over the next 4 periods. Since we are at the suspected seasonal inflection point (autumn recovery for jeans), I will use an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat based on an anticipated demand increase to approximately 45 units/week across the lead time (L+1=5), totaling 225. This slightly more aggressive forecast helps ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders to cover the seasonal uptick while the on-hand inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal recovery initiated: Demand monitoring shifts from summer trough (31 units/week) to an anticipated autumn climb for 'Everyday Collection' jeans.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans is exiting the summer trough (avg ~31 units/week) and entering the autumn recovery phase. Demand in Period 31 was 34 units (capped by stockout), and previous weeks showed a slight upward trend. History from Feb/March suggests demand for this collection can reach ~100 units/week. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there is a stockout, I need to set parameters that aggressive rebuild the pipeline to capture the seasonal uptick. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 55 (approx. 275 total for L+1=5) to reflect the transition from summer (31) toward autumn/early winter levels (70-100). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals. Sigma remains relatively high to protect against the volatility identified during seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery trend: Demand is increasing from the summer trough of 31 units/week. P31 experienced a stockout at 34 units, indicating immediate need for higher inventory levels to meet seasonal growth.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its autumn recovery phase (late September). Historical data shows demand traditionally peaks in late Q1 around 100+ units. Recent demand has climbed from a summer trough of ~30 to an average of ~32 over the last 5 weeks, but Period 31 saw a stockout, suggesting real demand is higher than registered sales. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must order now for arrivals in late October (Period 37). Based on the 2019/2/04 sample (145) and the early Q1 regime (~100), I forecast an autumn climb leading towards a mean of ~120 per week over the (L+1) horizon. Setting mu_hat to 600 (120 units/week * 5 weeks) and sigma_hat to 134 to account for the high volatility seen during seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Demand is trending upwards from summer lows as we enter late September. Period 31 stockout (at 34 units) confirms current inventory is insufficient for rising seasonal demand for jeans.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 34 (late September), seeing clear signs of an autumn seasonal recovery for 'Everyday Collection' jeans. Historical data from early 2019 shows demand can exceed 100 units/week during peak seasons. Recent demand has climbed from a summer trough of ~31 units to approximately 35-40 units, with a stockout occurring in P31. The inventory position is tight: 19 units on-hand against an expected climb. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by consecutive arrivals in P28, P30, P31, P32, and P33). To capture the seasonal uptick and prevent stockouts during the 4-period lead time window, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P29-P33 avg is ~31.4) but applying an 'explicit' override for sigma_hat to account for high forecasted volatility during this transition. I am also maintaining a very aggressive restocking posture (high base stock via high mu_hat or explicit orders) to rebuild the pipeline for October demand peaks.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Demand is trending upwards from summer lows as we enter late September. Period 31 stockout (at 34 units) confirms current inventory is insufficient for rising seasonal demand for jeans.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Everyday Collection' ankle-length jeans, which typically see a significant demand increase during the autumn season (September/October). Period 35 (Oct 7) is in the middle of this seasonal ramp-up. Historically, demand peaked at ~145 in early Feb. Recent demand has been climbing steadily from the summer trough (avg 31) to the high 30s, and we observed a stockout in Period 31. To prevent lost sales during this confirmed autumn recovery, I am increasing mu_hat using an 'explicit' forecast. Based on the 2019-02-04 demand of 145 and the current upward trajectory, I expect demand to reach approximately 75-80 units per week. With L=4 (meaning L+1=5), I am setting mu_hat = 5 * 80 = 400. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on numerous arrivals (including P28, P29, P30). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility during this transition period. The high 'in-transit' (356) includes the large P33 order (219), which is expected to arrive in Period 37, so the current order will be moderated by the OR backend's base-stock logic.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery trend: Demand is steadily increasing from the summer low of 31 units/week and is expected to return to Q1 levels (~80-100 units/week) based on product category (jeans) and current October date.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. We are in the 'Autumn recovery' phase for the 'Everyday Collection' jeans. Historical data from Q1 (Feb/March) showed demand levels between 80-140 units/week. While recent demand (P32-P35) has been relatively flat (29-38 units), we must anticipate the seasonal climb characteristic of denim products in mid-autumn to avoid stockouts as witnessed in P31. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual arrivals. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the backend target service level is 50%, which naturally builds a lean inventory. However, my 'mu_hat' must account for the impending seasonal increase to return to Q1 levels. I will use a mu_hat of 450 (calculated as (1+L) * 90) to position inventory for a 90 units/week demand forecast, which aligns with the bottom end of the Q1 peak regime. I use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility during this transition period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in the autumn season for 'Everyday Collection' ankle jeans. Historical demand from Q1 2019 (Feb-Mar) showed a mean of ~100 units/week. While recent demand samples (P32-P36: 30, 38, 36, 29, 13) show some volatility and a recent dip to 13, the broader seasonal context suggests we should prepare for an autumn/winter recovery toward Q1 levels. The P36 demand of 13 appears to be an outlier or temporary dip rather than a new downward trend, especially given the stockout at 34 units in P31 and the product category. Pipeline inventory is healthy (308 units), primarily driven by the large order in P33 (219 units) which is expected to arrive in P37. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts during the seasonal climb against holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the immediate trend while maintaining a base for recovery. L is set to 'default' (4) as lead times are consistent.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late October (2019/10/28). Demand for 'Everyday Collection' jeans showed very high levels in early Q1 (~100 units/week) and a significant trough in summer (~30 units/week). Our previous carry-over insights anticipated an autumn recovery towards Q1 levels, which prompted a large order in Period 33. However, demand in the last two periods (P36-P37) has been unexpectedly low (avg 13 units). This creates a conflict: historical Q1/Q2 seasonality suggests high demand, but recent weeks show a sharp, unexplained dip. With on-hand inventory at 335 units and 89 in-transit, we are significantly overstocked if current demand (13) persists, but well-positioned if we return to ~70 units. Given the high on-hand levels relative to recent demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (avg ~20) to avoid further over-ordering while maintaining a high safety stock (sigma_hat) to account for the possibility that demand spikes back to Q1 levels (80-100 units). L remains 4 based on consistent history.

Carry-over insight: Unexpected late October demand dip: Demand in Periods 36-37 dropped to ~13 units/week, significantly lower than the anticipated autumn recovery level (~35+).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we are observing a significant and sustained deviation from the expected autumn recovery for SKU 399256032. Demand over the last three periods (P36-P38) has plummeted to an average of ~14 units/week (13, 13, 16), which is lower even than the summer trough (~31) and far below the anticipated recovery levels (~35-40+). This unexpected late-October/early-November dip has left the system with a very high on-hand inventory of 343 units, following the arrival of large orders placed in anticipation of a seasonal climb. Given the 1:1 profit to holding cost ratio, the backend targeting a 50% service level is appropriate, but we must urgently lower the demand forecast to prevent further overstocking. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus exclusively on this new low-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the low volatility within this dip. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-autumn demand dip confirmed: Demand in Periods 36-38 dropped to an average of ~14 units/week, a significant departure from expected autumn recovery and the previous summer trough (~31).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40 (Nov 11), we are observing a significant and sustained demand drop that contradicts the earlier expectation of an autumn recovery for these jeans. Over the last four periods (P36-P39), demand has collapsed to an average of 14.25 units/week, down from the summer trough of ~31 and far below the Q1 peak of ~100. This suggests a late-season clearance or a shift in consumer preference as we move into colder November weather. Current on-hand inventory is 328 units, which covers over 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. With an additional 65 units in-transit (ordered P36), total inventory is 393 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0) and the massive overstock, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current low-demand regime (avg ~14) and prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary new orders while we draw down existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-autumn demand collapse: Demand in Periods 36-39 averaged ~14 units/week, a ~50% drop from the summer trough (~31) and ~85% drop from Q1 peaks, indicating a strong downward regime shift in November.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing a significant downward demand regime shift as of November 2019 (identified in Period 40 Carry-over Insight). Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), demand has dropped to an average of ~13.6 units/week (13, 13, 16, 15, 11), a sharp decline from previous expectations of an autumn recovery. The product (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is now likely in a late-autumn/pre-winter slump or end-of-season clearance phase. Inventory is currently very high (382 units on-hand with zero in-transit), which provides over 28 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. We must urgently minimize further ordering to avoid excessive holding costs. For parameters, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture this new low-demand regime, which will lower the base stock level. Because on-hand inventory (382) far exceeds any reasonable base stock for a 14 units/week mean, the OR backend will correctly stop ordering.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256032' (Women's Everyday Collection Skinny Jeans) has entered a severe late-autumn/winter demand collapse. Demand over the last 6 periods (P36-P41) has dropped to an average of ~11.6 units/week, with the most recent sample at only 4 units. This is a dramatic decrease from the summer trough (~31) and earlier Q1 levels (~100). Currently, on-hand inventory is 378 units with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate of ~11-12 units/week, this inventory represents approximately 32 weeks of supply, which is far beyond the (L+1) = 5 week target. To minimize further holding costs, I am setting parameters to cease all ordering. I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new low-demand regime (approximately 11.6 units per week), which will result in a base_stock level far below my current on-hand inventory, effectively stopping new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand collapse confirmed in November: demand in P36-P41 averaged ~12 units/week, an 85% decrease from Q1 levels, indicating this SKU is out-of-season or transitioning out of the 'Everyday' core demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Everyday Collection' jeans has experienced a significant and sustained collapse since mid-October. Over the last 7 periods (P36-P42), demand has averaged approximately 11.5 units per week, appearing to stabilize at a very low level for the winter season (4 and 9 units in the most recent two weeks). With current on-hand inventory at 369 units and virtually zero demand, the SKU is heavily overstocked. The current inventory covers over 30 weeks of demand at current rates, while there are only 5 periods remaining in the simulation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0) and the extreme overstock, the goal is to prevent any further ordering. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7-period regime (P36-P42) will align the base stock with the current low-demand reality, ensuring no new orders are triggered by the OR backend.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans is currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), with only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (total 47). Demand has completely collapsed since late October, averaging only ~10 units/week over the last 8 periods (P36-P43), with the most recent three periods showing 4, 9, and 9 units respectively. This is a severe drop compared to Q1 peaks (~100) and even the summer trough (~31). On-hand inventory is currently 360 units, which, at the current demand rate of ~10 units/week, represents 36 weeks of supply\u2014far exceeding the remaining 4 periods of the game. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) and the excess stock, the primary objective is to stop all ordering and minimize holding costs for the remainder of the session. mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted downwards using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the low-demand regime, though the inventory level is already so high that the OR backend will not place further orders regardless of these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease finalized for Dec 2019: Weekly demand stabilized at ~9 units (P41-P43), confirming the product is out-of-season or end-of-life.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a confirmed end-of-season or out-of-season phase as we approach mid-December (Period 45). Demand has plummeted from earlier peaks of ~100 units/week and even the summer trough of ~30 units/week to a current low-regime average of approximately 8-9 units/week over the last 4 periods (P41-P44). With on-hand inventory at 352 units and 0 units in-transit, the current stock is extremely high relative to current demand levels\u2014covering roughly 39 weeks of supply at the current rate (352 / 9). Since the game ends in Period 47, there is no need for further ordering. Parameters are set to reflect this extremely low demand regime to avoid any unnecessary system-driven orders. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current mean of ~8.5 units/week times the (1+L) factor, and sigma_hat is set to reflect the low volatility in this stagnant phase.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans (Womens Everyday Collection) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 8.6 units/week over the last 5 periods (P41-P45). This confirms the 'out-of-season' status or end-of-life phase identified in previous periods. With on-hand inventory at 341 units and zero units in-transit, the current stock covers nearly 40 weeks of demand at the current rate. The OR backend needs to stop ordering and minimize holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this extremely low demand regime (approx 8.6/week), which will result in a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand levels, effectively halting new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-335.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained low-demand regime at the end of December 2019, consistently averaging ~9 units per week since Period 41. On-hand inventory is 338 units, which is extremely high (covering over 30 periods of current demand). There are no in-transit units. Given the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), the goal is to prevent any further ordering while demand is low and inventory is excessive. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (P41-P46) to reflect the 'out-of-season' demand levels (~7-8 units mean). The OR backend will naturally place zero orders because the on-hand inventory (338) far exceeds the calculated base stock for this low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~8 units/week throughout December (Periods 41-46), confirming the product is currently out-of-season and inventory is in a heavy surplus position.
