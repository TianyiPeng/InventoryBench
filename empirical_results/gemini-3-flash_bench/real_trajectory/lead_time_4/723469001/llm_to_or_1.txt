Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is a 2-pack of push-up bras (staple womens lingerie). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks shows a downward trend (85, 71, 74, 49, 36). The mean of all 5 samples is 63, but the most recent two weeks (49, 36) suggest a significant drop compared to the initial three (85, 71, 74). Given the limited history and the recent downward shift, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the general mean while acknowledging the volatility. Promised lead time is 4. Since there is no lead time history yet, I'll use the default promised lead time. Inventory is currently zero, so the OR backend will trigger initial orders to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 43 units, but since starting inventory was 0, zero units were sold. An order of 96 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we expect this order to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Demand history shows a downward trend (85, 71, 74, 49, 36, 43), with the last 3 samples averaging 42.6. Given the product is a standard lingerie item (push-up bras), demand is relatively stable but currently in a lower regime compared to January. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this current demand level (avg ~43) for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. Lead time is set to default (4) as we have no evidence yet of deviations.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0 because previous orders (P1 and P2) have not arrived yet due to the promised lead time of 4 periods. The 'In-transit' balance is 150 (96 from P1 + 54 from P2). Historical demand shows a downward trend in January (85 to 49) followed by a low point in early February (36). HOWEVER, recent actual demand in P1 (43) and P2 (118) suggests a significant spike, potentially due to Valentine's Day or seasonal shifts for lingerie. Specifically, P2 demand (118) is the highest seen in the history. To prevent stockouts once shipments arrive, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent jump (49, 36, 43, 118) more aggressively than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for this increased volatility. Lead time (L) remains 'default' as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 2 (118 units) compared to trailing average (~60). Likely seasonal or promotional.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The SKU (Women's Lingerie) shows a significant demand shift. Historical demand before Period 1 averaged ~63 units, but recent demand in Period 2 (118) and Period 3 (84) suggests a higher regime. The average of the last 3 periods (P1-P3) is 81.67, significantly higher than the initial samples. Lead time is promised at 4 periods; the first order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 291 units in transit (96 from P1, 54 from P2, 141 from P3). To account for the recent demand surge and ensure sufficient base stock for the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the higher mean and standard deviation observed in the latest period data (43, 118, 84). L is kept at 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead time shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~63 to ~82 units over the last 3 periods (P1-P3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (96 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will only be visible in the next Period 6 'conclude' message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all previous demand has been lost due to stockouts. Total in-transit is 435 units (Orders from P1-P4). The historical demand samples (P-5 to P-1) and game history demand (P1-P4) show: [85, 71, 74, 49, 36, 43, 118, 84, 69]. The carry-over insight noted a regime shift/spike around P2-P3, but P4 demand (69) suggests a cooling down from the peak (118). The average of the last 5 samples (P4, P3, P2, P1, and the last historical sample) is approx 70.4. Because L=4, we need to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the higher volume compared to the pre-game samples, while maintaining L=4. Sigma is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high volatility (118 vs 69).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains elevated compared to historical baseline; avg units/period is approximately 78 over the last 4 periods versus ~60 previously.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). Examining the history, the order from Period 1 (96 units) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand history shows a spike in Period 2 (118) followed by stabilization. Recent historical samples: 85, 71, 74, 49, 36 (pre-game) and 43, 118, 84, 69, 47 (game history). The 'carry-over insights' suggest a regime shift to ~78-82 units, though the most recent sample (47) is lower. Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current on-hand is 49 with 376 in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). Since we have confirmed the lead time is 4, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the elevated demand regime noted in the carry-over insights (P1-P5 avg is 72.2) while acknowledging the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $877.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). Reviewing the history for SKU 723469001 (Women's Push-up bras): Promised Lead Time (L) is 4. Concluded arrivals for Period 1 and Period 2 orders both confirm an ACTUAL lead time of 4 periods (P1 ordered -> P5 arrived; P2 ordered -> P6 arrived). Thus, the promised lead time is stable and accurate. 

Starting Demand History (pre-game): 85, 71, 74, 49, 36 (Avg ~63). 
In-game Demand History: 43, 118, 84, 69, 47, 49 (Avg ~68). 
While there was a spike in Period 2 (118), recent demand has stabilized back toward the mean (47, 49). The carry-over insights correctly noted a regime shift earlier, but the most recent 2-3 periods suggest the 'spike' was temporary or that demand is settling into a mid-range. 

Current Inventory: On-hand (54) + In-transit (371). Pipeline is very heavy (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6 are yet to arrive). At L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. If avg demand is ~70, total requirement is ~350 units. We currently have 425 total units in the system. The OR backend's capped policy will likely result in small or zero orders to avoid excessive holding costs, as our pipeline is full. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the in-game variability while acknowledging the stabilization of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods consistently across first two arrivals (P1 and P2 orders). Demand spike from P2-P4 has subsided; demand for P5-P6 (avg 48) aligned closer to late pre-game levels.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The item is a 2-pack push-up bra. Historical demand shows a spike in Periods 2-4 (118, 84, 69) which has since subsided to a lower, more stable regime in Periods 5-7 (47, 49, 59), averaging 51.7 units. The initial pre-game samples (avg 63) are likely too high for the current post-spike trend. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stability. The lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods based on three arrivals (P1, P2, P3 orders), so I'll use the 'default' method. Total inventory (on-hand 136 + in-transit 254 = 390) is currently high relative to recent demand (~52/week), which will likely result in a capped order or no order, helping to manage holding costs as we stabilize from the previous spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized to a lower regime post-spike: Avg demand for Periods 5-7 is 51.7 units, compared to the Period 2-4 average of 90.3 units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P9 (2019/4/8). Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 159). Reviewing history, a major demand spike occurred in P8 (121 units), contradicting the previous stabilization trend noted in P8's carry-over (where P5-P7 avg was ~52). This P8 spike is nearly identical to the P2 spike (118 units), suggesting bi-weekly or monthly volatility in this underwear SKU. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P4 order arrived in P8). Given the lead time is 4, we must look ahead (L+1=5 periods). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is (47+49+59+121)/4 = 69. mu_hat should reflect this recent volatility and the higher average. sigma_hat should be recent_N to capture the high variance seen in P8. Setting L to 'calculate' as actual lead time has been consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Recurrent spikes observed (P2: 118, P8: 121) suggesting a non-stationary demand pattern. Average demand for the last 4 periods (P5-P8) has risen to 69 units/period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 8-9) shows a significant resurgence with values of 121 and 110, averaging 115.5. This effectively ends the lower demand regime seen in Periods 5-7 (average ~52) and aligns with the volatile pattern previously noted. Currently, on-hand inventory is 86 with 200 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P9). Based on consistent delivery history, the P6 order (49 units) is expected to arrive this period (P10). Given the lead time (L=4) and the high recent demand, mu_hat needs to reflect this new peak to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime (Avg ~97 in P7-P9) while maintaining the promised lead time L=4 as it remains stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: Sustained high demand returned in P8-P9 (avg 115.5), similar to the P2 spike. The intermediate 'low' regime (P5-P7) appears to be a trough in a volatile, potentially seasonal pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1325.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Kelly 2pk Melbourne push ct' (Womens Lingerie) is exhibiting high volatility with distinct high-demand phases. Historical data shows two major demand peaks: Periods 2-4 (avg ~90) and Periods 8-10 (avg ~101). Current demand for Period 10 was 73, suggesting a potential cooling from the recent peak (P8: 121, P9: 110), but still significantly higher than the early baseline. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been perfectly consistent throughout all historical arrivals (P5-P10). Given the high volatility (sigma) and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0, implying a ~95% target service level), it is critical to use a recent window for mu_hat that captures the currently elevated demand regime while maintaining a high sigma_hat. I will set N=3 for mu_hat (Periods 8-10) to reflect the recent high-demand cycle (avg ~101.3) and set N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen across the transition from the trough to the peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: High demand clusters (P2-P4 avg: 90.3, P8-P10 avg: 101.3) separated by a relative trough (P5-P7 avg: 51.7). Predicted regime remains 'High/Volatile' for P11.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'Push-up bras' has exhibited high volatility with two distinct peaks: an early peak (P2-P4, mean ~90) and a more recent sustained high (P8-P10, mean ~101). Period 11 demand dropped slightly to 76, but remains higher than the early baseline. The Lead Time (L) is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the status of orders from P1 through P7. On-hand inventory is currently low (10 units) due to the delayed arrival of smaller orders placed during the P5-P7 trough (only 24 units arrived in P11). Significant pipeline inventory (433 units) exists, but current coverage is thin. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~95 per period) while acknowledging the high volatility. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=10 to integrate the substantial variance observed between the troughs and peaks, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a 'High/Volatile' state: Average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P8-P11) is 95 units, significantly higher than the P5-P7 average (51.7). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sustained high-demand regime, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) reaching 102 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 12 (demand 130 vs on-hand 10). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all arrivals since Period 5, which confirms the promised lead time holds. The pipeline is currently full (566 units in-transit) following large orders in Periods 9-12, but we must maintain stock for the upcoming (L+1) window. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this higher mean demand (approx 102 per period) and sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation approx 27) seen in this recent peak period. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the current high-demand cycle while minimizing additional stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains 'High' with a 5-period average (P8-P12) of 102 units, compared to the previously observed 51.7 during the P5-P7 trough. A stockout occurred in P12 due to on-hand exhaustion, highlighting the need for higher base stock levels during this cycle.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 (Women's Lingerie) remains in a high-volatility regime with distinct clusters of high demand (P8-P12 avg: 102 units) followed by potential dips. Recent demand in Period 13 dropped to 44 units, which is a significant departure from the previous 4-week high. This product shows a pattern where high demand periods (around 100+ units) last for 3-5 weeks, followed by shorter periods of lower demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P9 order arriving in P13). In-transit inventory is high (480 units), largely due to significant orders placed between P10 and P12 to recover from stockouts. To avoid over-ordering during a potential cooling-off period while protecting against the next spike, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting (N=6 to capture the most recent high-demand cycle and the current dip) and maintain the lead time at the confirmed 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods (P8-P13) provides a balanced estimate of the current volatile regime (~87 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Cycle of high clusters (avg ~100) and sharp troughs (avg ~45-50). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. This product (Push-up bras) has exhibited clear demand cycles. We previously observed a 'high' regime (P8-P11 avg: 95) followed by a sharp drop in demand (P13: 44, P14: 55), mimicking the trough observed in Periods 5-7 (avg: 51.7). Historical data shows that troughs in this SKU last approximately 3 periods before demand spikes again. Currently, on-hand inventory is 180 units with 349 units in transit; however, we must maintain stock to handle the next expected high-demand cluster. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). Demand for the most recent 2 periods has shifted to a lower regime (avg: 49.5). I am selecting a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the current trough while smoothing slightly for the expected turnaround, and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7) to better capture the significant volatility between regimes.

Carry-over insight: Demand has entered a second 'trough' phase starting Period 13: avg demand for P13-P14 is 49.5, compared to the P8-P12 'high' cluster avg of 102. This confirms a cyclical pattern of approximately 4-6 weeks of high demand followed by 3 weeks of low demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 723469001 shows a distinct cyclical pattern. We observed a 'high' cluster (Periods 8-12, average ~102) followed by a 'trough' phase (Periods 13-15, average ~47). This mirrors the earlier P2-P4 high and P5-P7 trough. We are currently in the third period of this low-demand trough (P13-P15 demand: 44, 55, 43). Based on the 3-period trough duration seen previously (P5-P7), we anticipate demand may begin to rise again soon. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Current inventory (On-hand: 291, In-transit: 195) is exceptionally high due to large orders placed during the previous stockout-scare in P11-P12 arrives now. To avoid excessive holding costs during this trough, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the current lower regime, but allowing sigma_hat to reflect the higher overall volatility (recent 10 periods) to ensure the backend maintains a safety buffer for the next expected upturn.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough pattern confirmed: The low-demand phase typically lasts 3 periods (observed P5-P7 and P13-P15) with an average of ~50 units, following a 5-period peak phase of ~100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3636.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 exhibit a cyclical pattern consisting of high-demand clusters (~5-6 periods, avg ~100 units) followed by low-demand troughs (~3 periods, avg ~50 units). In Period 16, demand spiked to 203, signaling a transition out of the trough phase (P13-P15 avg: 47 units) and back into a peak phase. The average demand during previous peak clusters (P8-P11) was approximately 108 units per period. Since we are entering a new peak phase, I am selecting an 'explicit' mu_hat based on this anticipated mean: (1 + L) * 105 = (1 + 4) * 105 = 525. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. While current on-hand (221) and in-transit (62) are significant, the OR backend's capped policy will prevent over-ordering if the calculated base stock is below inventory levels, but setting a high mu_hat ensures we are prepared for the sustained high demand expected over the next 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: New peak demand phase confirmed starting Period 16 (demand: 203). Expected peak phase duration: 5 periods with average demand ~105 units. Next trough expected around Period 21.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand peak phase that began in Period 16. Recent demand values are 203 (P16) and 222 (P17), which are significantly higher than the previous peak average of ~100. This suggests a secondary, more intense seasonal surge (likely early summer/June). The carry-over insight predicted a 5-period peak, expected to last until Period 20. However, the intensity has doubled. Base stock logic needs to account for this higher mean. Period 17 demand (222) and Period 16 demand (203) suggest a new mean of ~212 for the current regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. On-hand is low (40), and while in-transit (242) is significant, current demand levels (222/period) will exhaust this quickly. I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect this significantly higher demand regime (212 * 5 = 1060) to ensure the backend places sufficiently large orders to maintain service levels during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Intense peak phase confirmed starting Period 16: Demand has surged to >200 units/period (avg 212.5), doubling the previous peak intensity. This regime is expected to persist through Period 20.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-intensity demand phase (2019/6/17), with recent demands of 203, 222, and 157 (avg 194). A stockout occurred in Period 18 due to insufficient on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Our pipeline inventory is 595 units (from orders in P15-P18), but the next arrival in Period 19 will be 0 units (since ordered=0 in P15). This means we will face another stockout in Period 19 before the larger orders from P17-P18 arrive. To recover and maintain service levels for the remainder of this 'peak' phase (estimated through P20) and ensure coverage for the next cycle, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the current high-volatility regime. L remains at the promised/confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Current demand peak (P16-P18) has reached a new intensity level (avg ~194), significantly higher than the previous peak of ~100.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-point of a significant demand peak (P16-P19) which is notably stronger than previous peaks, averaging ~190 units/period. Historically, these peaks last approximately 5 periods before transitioning into a trough (avg ~50). Period 20 is expected to be the final period of this extreme peak before a transition. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to the surge, making us entirely reliant on arrivals from P15/P16/P17 orders. To handle the remaining surge and provide a safety buffer for the high variance observed (demand reaching 222 units), I am setting Mu to reflect the current peak regime (avg ~190). I will use recent_N=4 for Mu and Sigma to capture this specific high-intensity window (Periods 16-19). This translates to a target base stock covering 5 periods of elevated demand (L+1), ensuring we capture the tail end of the peak and recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: The current demand peak (P16-P19) has sustained an average of ~190 units, nearly double the previous high regime (~100 units). As of P19, on-hand inventory is depleted but pipeline is substantial (844 units).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained 'super-peak' demand regime that began in Period 16. In the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 198 units per period (203, 222, 157, 178, 230), which is significantly higher than previous peak cycles (~100 units). As predicted in previous carry-over insights, this peak phase has lasted approximately 5 periods. Based on the observed cyclicality (P5-P7 and P13-P15), a trough is typically expected after 5 peak periods. However, given the extreme intensity of this current peak and the fact that we have been stocked out (ending on-hand = 0) for the last three periods (P18-P20), there is likely significant latent demand or a shift in the baseline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the potential upcoming trough, I will set mu_hat using the average of the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current intensity, while keeping L at the promised 4 periods. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to account for the high volatility seen during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak demand phase (P16-P20) confirmed with an average of 198 units/period, nearly double the previous high regime. High stockout risk persists due to zero on-hand inventory since P18.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a 'super-peak' demand regime that began around Period 16. The average demand for the last six periods (P16-P21) is 190.1 units per period, which is roughly double the previous peak intensity (~100 units). Demand for the last period (P21) was 151 units, showing some cooling but still remaining significantly above historical levels. Based on our cyclic analysis (P16-P20 sustained ~200, P21 showing a slight dip), we may be approaching a transition back to a lower-demand trough within the next 1-2 periods. However, due to the critical stockouts in Periods 18-20, we must maintain a high base stock to prevent further lost sales while being cautious about overstocking as we exit the super-peak. Actual lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P17 order arrived P21). I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current high-demand context (avg ~190, implying 5 * 190 = 950 for review+lead). Sigma_hat will be set using the same period (N=6) to account for the heightened volatility observed during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak demand phase (P16-P21) avg confirmed at ~190 units/period (nearly double previous 100-unit peak). P21 (151 units) may signal the beginning of the expected transition to a trough phase.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 has recently transitioned out of a 'super-peak' phase (P16-P21, avg ~190 units) into what appears to be a lower regime (P22 demand: 93). This follows the previously observed cyclical behavior where high-demand clusters (typically 5 periods) are followed by troughs (typically 3 periods). The demand in P22 (93 units) is significantly lower than the P16-P20 average but still higher than previous trough averages (~50 units). Given the high on-hand inventory (351) and massive pipeline (630), and the expectation that we are entering a lower demand phase, I am adjusting parameters to reflect this cooling period. Mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (representing the transition from peak to trough), and L remains at the stable 4-period mark. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the high volatility observed during regime transitions.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition confirmed at Period 22: Demand dropped to 93 units following a 6-period super-peak (P16-P21 avg ~190). Expected trough phase initiated. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 has transitioned from a 'super-peak' (P16-P21 avg: ~190) to a lower regime. Periodic analysis (P5-P7 and P13-P15) suggests the presence of troughs following peak phases. Demand for the last two periods (P22-P23) averaged 100 units, significantly lower than the preceding peak but higher than previous troughs (~50). This suggests we are in a 'medium' or 're-stabilizing' regime following the intense summer surge. Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 493, In-transit: 399) because the massive orders placed to satisfy the super-peak (P17-P20) are now arriving while demand has cooled. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and on-hand inventory, and the shift to a lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this correction phase. This will prevent excessive over-ordering while maintaining a buffer against the residual volatility of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 22: Transitioned from super-peak (avg 190) to a lower regime (P22-P23 avg 100). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 (Women's Lingerie) has transitioned from a super-peak phase (P16-P21, avg ~190 units) to a lower regime. The average demand for the last three periods (P22-P24) is 111 units, which is consistent with the 'High' regime observed earlier (P8-P12, ~102 units) rather than the deep troughs (~50 units). Based on historical seasonality, the current period (late July) is moving away from the early summer peak but remains higher than the spring baseline. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 571 units, supplemented by 188 units in-transit. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the current 111-unit regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (since the regime shift at P22) and L at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-super-peak: Period 22-24 average is 111 units, significantly lower than the P16-P21 average of 190 but higher than the previous trough level of ~50.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 has transitioned from a 'super-peak' (Periods 16-21, avg ~190) to a stabilized post-peak regime. Over the most recent four periods (P22-P25), demand has averaged 114 units (93, 107, 133, 123), which is lower than the peak but significantly higher than the earlier trough levels (~50). On-hand inventory is currently high (495 units) due to the large orders placed during the peak arriving now (P20 arrival in P24, P21 arrival in P25). With 141 units still in-transit (P22's 123 and P23's 18), we are well-covered for the lead time + review period. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the current ~114 units/period regime, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to accurately capture this post-peak level. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to reflect recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-super-peak demand regime stabilized: Average demand for P22-P25 is 114 units, establishing a new baseline between previous peaks (~190) and troughs (~50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1142.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized into a post-super-peak state with an average demand of approximately 109 units over the last 5 periods (P22-P26: 93, 107, 133, 123, 88). This is lower than the super-peak (avg ~190) but higher than previous troughs (avg ~50). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 530 units on hand and only 18 units in transit (expected from P23's order arriving in P27 conclude), the pipeline inventory is quite high relative to current demand needs. The current on-hand levels are sufficient to cover over 4 periods of demand at the current average. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture this stabilized 'middle' regime. The OR backend with default sigma will aim for a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, but since on-hand is already high, it will likely result in a zero or small order quantity to bleed off excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-super-peak stability: Demand for P22-P26 has stabilized at an average of ~109 units (compared to the P16-P21 super-peak avg of ~190 and previous troughs of ~50).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 has transitioned from a 'super-peak' (Periods 16-21, avg ~190) to a stabilized post-peak regime. Over the most recent six periods (P22-P27), demand has averaged 112.3 units (93, 107, 133, 123, 88, 130). This represents a new baseline that is significantly lower than the super-peak but higher than the earlier troughs (~50). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 23 order in Period 27. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 418 units, while the pipeline is low (67 units arriving from P27). I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture this stabilized post-peak demand (approx 112 units/period) across the lead time + review period (L+1=5). This ensures the base stock aligns with the current stabilized regime while preventing over-ordering as the super-peak data fades.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 has transitioned from the 'super-peak' phase (P16-P21 avg: ~190) to a more moderate but stable regime. Over the last seven periods (P22-P28), demand has averaged approximately 106 units per period (93, 107, 133, 123, 88, 130, 65). This is significantly higher than the original troughs (~50) but lower than the super-peaks. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, verified by multiple 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 353 units, with 211 units in-transit (ordered in P27 and P28). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this post-peak stabilization while sigma_hat is also calculated over the same period to reflect the current volatility. This approach ensures base stock levels cover (L+1) periods of the current demand regime, avoiding excessive holding costs while maintaining service levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-super-peak demand regime (P22-P28) stabilized at a mean of ~106 units, approximately double the early-game baseline but ~45% lower than the super-peak intensity.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again. Following the 'super-peak' (P16-P21, avg ~190) and a subsequent mid-level stabilization period (P22-P27, avg ~109), the most recent two periods (P28-P29) show a sharp decline back to troughs of 65 and 60 units. This mirrors the early-game troughs (P5-P7) and the pre-peak trough (P13-P15), which averaged around 50 units. We are likely entering a 3-4 week low-demand phase. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Current inventory position is high: On-hand is 293 and In-transit is 268 (total 561). Given the expected trough demand of ~60-70 units, a base stock targeting ~100-110 units per period (combined L+1 = 5 periods) is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against the next potential peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the post-super-peak behavior while beginning to weight the recent drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 28: Transitioned from post-super-peak stability (~109 units) to a new trough phase (avg 62.5 over P28-P29), consistent with historical cyclical patterns.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 has entered a low-demand 'trough' phase, consistent with the cyclical pattern identified in previous periods. Over the last three weeks (P28-P30), demand has averaged 61.3 units (65, 60, 59), which aligns with the historical trough level of ~50-60 reported in Carry-Over Insights (e.g., P5-P7 avg 51.7, P13-P15 avg 50). This low phase typically lasts about 3-4 periods before a potential ramp-up. Currently, we have 234 units on-hand and 311 in-transit. With the lead time stable at 4 periods, we need to set parameters that recognize this current lower demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer in case of a sudden shift back to the 'post-super-peak' baseline (~109 units). I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current trough dynamics (average ~61), ensuring we don't over-order while holding costs are applicable. Lead time remains 'default' at 4 as observed transitions confirm consistent delivery timing.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted into a third trough phase, with demand consistently hovering around 60 units for the last 4 periods (P28-P31 avg: 60.5). Historically, these troughs (P5-P7 and P13-P15) last approximately 3-4 periods. We are currently in the 4th period of this trough. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 243 and in-transit at 244 (total pipeline 487), and an expected trough demand of ~60 units, our current coverage is approx 8 periods, which is sufficient. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current trough mean and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current lower volatility. This prevents over-ordering while maintaining a safety buffer in case the next peak phase begins earlier than expected.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough confirmed: Third trough phase started at P28, with a 4-period average of 60.5 units (P28-P31). This follows the cyclical pattern of high peaks followed by ~60-unit troughs.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 is currently in its third 'trough' phase, which historically lasts 3-4 periods. The average demand for the last five periods (P28-P32) is approximately 61.6 units. Based on the previous cycles (P5-P7 and P13-P15), we anticipate a return to a higher demand regime (either the ~100 unit 'high' or the ~190 unit 'super-peak') within the next 1-2 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals (L=4). With 321 units on hand and 100 in transit (from P29 and P30), the current pipeline is 421. Given the expectation of an upcoming demand surge and the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat to reflect a transition towards the 'high' regime average (approx 100 units/period) rather than the current trough average to avoid the stockouts experienced in previous transitions (like P12 and P18). I am using a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat (covering P22-P32) to capture the post-super-peak average of ~92 units/period, which provides a safer buffer for the next cycle than the 60-unit trough average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1882.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the latest period (P33) was 113 units, which is a significant increase from the previous four-period trough average of 60.5 units (P28-P31). This suggests the end of the trough and a return to a higher demand regime, consistent with the cyclical pattern observed in previous periods (e.g., P5-P7 trough vs P8-P12 peak). Historically, these peak phases have seen averages between 100 and 190 units. I will set mu_hat to reflect this transition by using a recent_N of 6, which covers the end of the trough and the current jump, resulting in a forecast that anticipates higher demand while being moderated by the very recent low values. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand trough (P28-P32) appears to have ended with a 113-unit demand in P33. Transitioning to a high-demand regime, historically averaging ~100-110 units (pre-super-peak) or ~190 (super-peak).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 remains cyclical. Period 33's demand spike (113 units) followed by Period 34's dip (44 units) suggests we are either transitioning into a moderate peak phase (historical avg ~100-110 units) or experiencing continued volatility around the trough baseline (~50-60 units). Given the upcoming potential for a seasonal peak observed in the history (around Period 16), and the recent high Period 33, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 7 periods (P28-P34) encompassing the trough and the start of this new phase, which averages ~73 units. This provides a balanced forecast between the trough and the anticipated moderate peak. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to capture recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand regime remains volatile post-trough; Period 33 (113) and Period 34 (44) suggest an unstable transition. Recent 7-period average (P28-P34) is 73.3 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a distinct cyclical demand pattern: peak phases (lasting ~5-6 periods) and trough phases (lasting ~3-5 periods). We are currently at the conclusion of a trough phase that began around Period 28. Over the last 8 periods (P28-P35), demand has averaged 62.6 units. While Period 33 showed a spike (113 units), the subsequent two periods (P34: 44, P35: 36) suggest the trough might be slightly extended. Given the history of sudden shifts towards higher intensity (e.g., P16 surge to ~190), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the current lower baseline (~63 units/period) while maintaining enough buffer for a potential return to the 'post-super-peak' level (~110 units). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. The on-hand inventory (228) and in-transit (149) provide a healthy pipeline as we wait for the next regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Current demand trough (P28-P35) has lasted 8 periods with an average of 62.6 units, slightly longer than previous troughs. Transition to the next high phase is currently volatile/unstable.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 is currently in a prolonged 'trough' phase, which has lasted 9 periods (P28-P36). The average demand during this trough is approximately 61.8 units. While a spike was observed in P33 (113 units), subsequent periods (P34-P36) returned to low levels (44, 36, 56). Historically, these troughs last between 3 and 9 periods, followed by a 'peak' phase (~100-190 units). Given that the current trough is at its longest recorded duration, I am preparing for a potential transition back to higher demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 172 units on-hand and 170 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 342), we are well-covered for the current trough (avg ~62, needs ~310 for L+1). I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples to capture the entirety of the current trough regime while allowing for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Current demand trough (P28-P36) has persisted for 9 periods with an average of 61.8 units, the longest trough observed to date.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2012.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 continues in a low/trough phase but shows signs of volatility with Period 37 demand at 116 units, following a long stretch of ~60-unit demand. Historically, troughs have lasted 3-9 periods. Period 37 is the 10th period of this relatively low-demand regime (avg ~62 units). However, the recent jump to 116 suggests a potential transition back to a high-demand regime (~100-110 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 192 units on hand and 81 in-transit (orders from P35, P36, P37), the pipeline inventory is relatively low compared to potential peak demand. To prepare for a regime shift while avoiding excessive holding costs if the trough persists, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent activity (including the P37 jump) and use default settings for sigma to account for the inherent volatility observed in this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Longest demand trough (P28-P36) appears to be ending; Period 37 demand (116) signals a shift back toward the historical 'high' regime (avg ~100-110). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 exhibit cyclical behavior with distinct peak and trough phases. We have just exited the longest recorded trough phase (P28-P36, avg ~62) and are entering a new 'High' regime initiated by Period 37 (demand 116) and Period 38 (demand 88). Historically, 'High' regimes average between 100-110 units. Given the seasonality (entering November), I am setting mu_hat conservatively towards the historical high-mean of 100 units/period. Over (1+L)=5 periods, this results in an explicit mu_hat of 500. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the increased volatility of regime transitions. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand (104) plus pipeline (237) totals 341, which is below the expected 500 required for the next lead time cycle, justifying the use of these parameters to trigger replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 37: Longest trough (9 periods) ended, transitioning to a High regime (avg demand ~100).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted from the longest observed trough (P28-P36, avg ~62) back to a 'High' profile starting at P37. The last three periods (P37-P39) show demands of 116, 88, and 71 (avg 91.7). Historically, peaks in this SKU's cycle occur in two intensities: a 'standard' peak (~100-110 units) and a 'super-peak' (~190 units). Given the date (Nov 11) and the product (Womens Lingerie/Push-up Bras), we are entering the peak holiday shopping season (Singles' Day, Black Friday, Christmas). I expect demand to accelerate toward the super-peak levels observed previously (P16-P21). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have low on-hand inventory (46) and are entering a likely high-demand seasonal period, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for a predicted average demand of 150 units over the lead time + review period (5 periods total), balancingBetween the 100-unit standard peak and the 190-unit super-peak. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal holiday peak anticipated: Demand regime shifting from 'High' (avg ~92) toward 'Super-Peak' (avg ~190) levels as of P40 (Nov 11).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18), we are entering the peak late-November shopping season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Historically, we observed a 'Super-Peak' from P16-P21 where demand averaged ~190 units. Given the date and the product (Womens Lingerie/Push-up bras), a similar surge is highly probable. Current on-hand inventory is very low (11 units), making us vulnerable to stockouts as the surge begins. Although the pipeline is high (557 units), most of those units were only ordered in the last few periods (P38-P40) and will not arrive until P42-P44. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to reflect the anticipated 190 units/period 'Super-Peak' intensity across the (L+1)=5 period lead time window (190 * 5 = 950). Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 110 (roughly sqrt(5)*50) to account for the high volatility seen during previous demand transitions.

Carry-over insight: Super-Peak demand regime (avg ~190) anticipated to recur starting Period 41, aligned with late November seasonal retail cycles. Previous Super-Peak (P16-P21) lasted 6 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 42 (Nov 25), exactly 41 periods since the game began (Feb 11). This date aligns with the start of the 'Black Friday' seasonal retail peak. Historically, a 'Super-Peak' occurred in Periods 16-21 (late May to June) where demand averaged ~190 units, doubling the baseline 'High' regime of ~100. Given the date (Nov 25) and the product (Womens Lingerie/Push-up bra), we anticipate demand to escalate significantly towards this ~190 range starting now. Recent demand (P37-P41) has been inconsistent (116, 88, 71, 56, 43), but this likely represents the bottom of the volatility before the holiday surge. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the entire history. I will set L to 4 using 'calculate'. For mu_hat, I will use an 'explicit' value of 950 (calculated as (4+1) * 190) to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient for the anticipated seasonal super-peak. For sigma_hat, I will use 'explicit' 200 (approx sqrt(5) * 90) to account for high volatility seen during previous peaks.

Carry-over insight: Entering holiday Seasonal Super-Peak (expected Nov-Dec). Historical super-peak intensity avg ~190 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). Historically, this SKU experienced a 'Super-Peak' (avg ~190 units/period) during a similar timeframe (P16-P21). While recent demand (P38-P42: 88, 71, 56, 43, 88) has not yet hit those levels, the date aligns with the pre-holiday seasonal surge observed in many retail categories. Given the game ends at Period 47 and we are facing a 4-period lead time, any order placed now will arrive in Period (43+4=47), the final resolution phase. Pipeline inventory is high (963 units), including large orders from P40-P42 (201, 271, 338 units). These are expected to arrive in Periods 44, 45, and 46 respectively. To prevent localized stockouts during the anticipated seasonal peak while avoiding excessive holding costs on arriving pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 190 (the Super-Peak average) to maintain high base stock levels, but the OR backend's inventory-minus-pipeline logic should naturally moderate new ordering since our pipeline already covers much of this demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9). Based on historical calendar patterns observed in Periods 16-21 (June 'super-peak'), we have been anticipating a recurring super-peak for the holiday season (Nov-Dec). Although demand in P43 was unexpectedly low (29 units), we are in the heart of the December shopping season for 'Womens Lingerie'. Historical super-peaks reached ~190 units/period. My strategy is to maintain a high base stock to cover the expected holiday surge. I will keep mu_hat aligned with the expected super-peak intensity (~190 units/period) using an explicit value of 950 (which is (1+L)*190, where L=4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrivals through P43. Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to account for the extreme volatility observed during such peaks (e.g., jumps from 29 to 200+).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand volatility remains extreme; P43 saw a sharp drop to 29 units despite being in the December holiday window. However, maintaining 'Super-Peak' readiness (avg ~190) is necessary given historical June patterns and retail seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45). Demand in the last two periods (P43-P44) has been unexpectedly low (29 and 23 units), despite being in a window where we historically saw 'Super-Peak' (avg ~190) or 'High' (avg ~100) behavior. However, the retail calendar (Dec 16) suggests that pre-Christmas spikes or clearance surges could still occur, and we must avoid the stockouts seen in previous high-intensity cycles. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy (385) and the pipeline remains large (789). Given the recent demand drop, using N=3 for demand statistics would result in a very low forecast that ignores seasonal risk. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 (P38-P44) to capture the transition from the high P37/P38 levels down to the current lows, providing a balanced baseline of ~57 units/period (or ~285 for review+lead). This provides protection against a late-December surge while acknowledging the recent slowdown to minimize excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Significant mid-December demand drop observed: P43-P44 average demand fell to 26 units, signaling a departure from expected Super-Peak or High regimes seen in previous cycles.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019). The demand pattern has deviated significantly from the expected seasonal 'Super-Peak' (avg ~190). Instead of a surge, the last three periods (P43-P45) have seen remarkably low demand: 29, 23, and 63 units respectively (avg ~38). This suggests that for this specific SKU (a 2pk cotton push-up bra), the holiday peak may have occurred earlier or is non-existent, moving instead into a trough-like state. On-hand inventory is high (593 units) and in-transit inventory is substantial (518 units), covering likely demand for many periods. Given the overstocked position and the confirmed low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture this downward shift immediately and prevent further unnecessary ordering. I am maintaining lead time L at 4 based on consistent historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: Expected year-end super-peak failed to materialize; instead, demand entered a low trough (P43-P45 avg: 38.3 units), a 75% decrease from the preceding 'High' regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $369.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), the expected year-end holiday super-peak has failed to materialize. Demand for the last four periods (P43-P46) has averaged ~45 units (29, 23, 63, 65), which is a significant drop from the 'High' regime (avg ~90) and the previous 'Super-Peak' (avg ~190). Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (866 units) due to aggressive ordering in P40-P42. Relative to the current demand trough, we are significantly overstocked. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand levels and the persistent low-demand regime, I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=4) to align \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with the current trough reality, preventing additional orders and minimizing holding costs while riding out the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough confirmed extending through Dec: P43-P46 average demand is 45 units, establishing a low-demand regime during what was expected to be a peak period.
