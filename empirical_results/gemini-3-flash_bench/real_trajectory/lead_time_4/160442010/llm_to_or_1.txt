Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 160442010 (3p Sneaker Socks). This is a basic apparel item. The promised lead time is 4 periods. We have historical demand for 5 weeks: [84, 54, 56, 70, 72], with a mean of 67.2 and a standard deviation of 12.3. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, we must place an order to cover the (L+1) horizon (5 periods). Given the stability of the 5 historical samples following the initial observation, I will use all 5 samples to establish the forecast. No clear seasonal ramp-up is yet evident for mid-February, so I will rely on the historical average. The backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock of approximately (1+4)*67.2 + z*sqrt(1+4)*12.3 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect this recent stable history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a staple item. Initial historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 67.6 units/week (84, 54, 56, 70, 72). Period 1 demand was 81, which is slightly above the previous average but within a reasonable range. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (88 units) has a promised lead time of 4 periods and is not expected to arrive until Period 5. We have 81 units of lost sales from Period 1 due to 0 starting inventory. For parameters: L is set to 'default' (4). For mu_hat, considering the slightly higher recent demand (81) vs historical mean (67.6), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (the 5 historical points plus Period 1's actual demand) to capture the trend while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect this volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is Women's Sneaker Socks, which typically sees a demand increase as spring approaches (late February/March). Historical data shows a clear upward trend in demand: 84, 54, 56, 70, 72 (pre-game samples) followed by 81, 199, and 245 in the first three periods. This indicates a significant regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 4, the first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during the conclusion of Period 5 and become visible in Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. Demand has shifted from a mean of ~67 to over 200 in the last two weeks. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent spike (average ~175 per week) and adjust for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 2: weekly demand increased from ~70 to 200+ (+180% shift).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is 3p Sneaker Socks, likely entering a spring season peak (mid-March). Historical demand before the simulation was ~70, but simulation demand has surged: P1=81, P2=199, P3=245, P4=132. The average demand over the last 3 periods is 192. Promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in P1 (88 units) should arrive during P5's arrival phase and become visible in the P5 conclude message (read at P6). Currently, on-hand is 0 and we have 664 units in-transit (P1:88, P2:90, P3:171, P4:315). Because we are stock-out and demand has structurally shifted higher than the pre-simulation baseline, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher mean and volatility of the simulation period. This will ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated over (1+L) periods (~5 weeks) based on the elevated demand levels seen since P1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product is 3p Sneaker Socks. Analysis of the history shows a massive demand regime shift from an average of ~67 in pre-game/Period 1 to ~178 over Periods 2-5. Although Periods 4 and 5 showed lower demand than 2 and 3, they remain significantly higher than the initial baseline. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived in Period 5 with a lead time of 4, matching the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the 88 units that arrived were immediately sold. In-transit inventory is 860 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), with the P2 order (90 units) expected to arrive this period (P6). To ensure the OR backend covers the current high-demand regime, I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the trend since the shift in Period 2. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. L is set to 'calculate' as the confirmed lead time matches the promised one.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. The product is 3p Sneaker Socks, which shows a significant demand increase starting in mid-February, likely due to spring seasonality. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 902 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5 and P6). Demand history shows a shift: Initial samples (Jan) averaged ~67, while recent weeks (P2-P6) average ~191. The carry-over insight noted a shift to 200+, but recent samples (P4-P5) were lower (132, 136) before jumping back to 243 in P6. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the post-shift average (approx 191/week), and since lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, I will use the default lead time. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility since the demand shift. The OR backend will target a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand (~955 units).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which typically sees a seasonal demand increase as weather warms up in Spring. Historical demand confirms a jump from ~70-80 units in early February (Periods 1) to an average of ~200+ units since Period 2. The most recent demand (Period 7) spiked to 302, suggesting the Spring seasonality is accelerating. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 888 units in transit. Since we have been stocking out (sold < demand for all arrival periods), we need to raise our targets. Period 4 (ordered 315) should arrive this period, and Period 5 (ordered 284) next period. To capture the recent upward trend and seasonality, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to focus on the post-Period 2 regime, and setting sigma_hat using recent_N to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand confirmed: Avg demand for Periods 2-7 is 209 units, compared to initial 81. Seasonal acceleration likely as of Period 7 (302 units).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/04/08). Historical analysis shows a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 2, further accelerating in Period 7. The product (3-pack Sneaker Socks) is entering its peak season as footwear transitions to low-profile shoes in spring. Current demand (Periods 6-8) is 243, 302, and 343 units respectively (mean = 296). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have been stock-out constrained for every period except Period 8, meaning true demand might even be slightly higher than captured sales or 'demand' labels if latent demand exists. However, we'll use the recorded demand of the last 3 periods to set the forecast. Promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5-P8) confirm an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. Therefore, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 3-period mean (~296) gives a mu_hat of 5 * 296 = 1480. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent period to capture the current volatility of this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: last 3 periods average 296 units (P6-P8), confirming a secondary increase from the initial P2 shift average (~200). Seasonal peak for sneaker socks is active.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which experiences increasing demand as weather warms in April. Current date is 2019-04-15. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: initial periods (P1) were ~80 units, followed by a shift to ~200 units (P2-P5), and a further increase to ~300 units (P6-P8). Period 9 saw a slight dip to 208, but the 3-period average remains high at 284 units. On-hand inventory is 76, and in-transit is 954. Since the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P9), I will continue using L=4. For demand forecast (mu_hat), the most recent regime (P7-P9) average is (302+343+208)/3 = 284.3 units per period. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this high-demand spring phase while smoothing the latest volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019/04/22). The item is sneaker socks, which are highly seasonal as we move into warmer spring and summer months. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: Period 2-5 averaged ~153, while Period 6-10 averaged ~291. Specifically, the last three periods (P8-P10) averaged 304 units despite stockouts limiting the recorded 'sold' units. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (P1 arrived P5, P6 arrived P10). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand exceeded supply. In-transit inventory is 1221 units (orders from P7-P10). To prevent further stockouts during this peak seasonal growth, I am increasing \u03bc\u0302 to reflect the high-regime average (approx 300 units/week). L is kept at 4 based on reliable arrival history. sigma_hat is set using recent_N to capture the increased volatility of the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P6-P10 demand average is 291 units. Seasonality for sneaker socks is peaking as spring progresses in April/May.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 3p Sneaker Socks, which is entering its peak seasonal period in late April/May. The demand has shown a clear upward trajectory: initial baseline ~70, then ~200, and now the last 5 periods (P7-P11) average 321.2 units (302, 343, 208, 361, 392). P11 demand reached 392, confirming high seasonality. Regarding lead time, arrivals for P1 through P7 have consistently hit the 4-period mark perfectly. There are no missing shipments; the current in-transit (1423 units) matches the sum of orders from P8-P11 (286+379+399+359). I will set L to 'default' (4) as confirmed by the consistent history. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this peak demand regime of ~321 units/week. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 7-11 average demand rose to 321 units/week (+10% from previous high regime). Peak seasonality for sneaker socks is active in late April.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which is entering peak seasonality in May. Demand has shown a significant sustained increase: the average demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 334.6 units, up from the ~320 average noted previously. Period 12 demand was 369. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have been consistently selling out, suggesting demand is constrained by supply. Lead time (L=4) remains stable as confirmed by arrivals from P5-P8. To ensure enough stock for the 5-period window (lead time + current period), mu_hat should reflect the current peak demand level (~335). Using recent_N=5 captures this most recent demand regime. sigma_hat with recent_N=5 will adjust for the higher volatility seen during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 8-12 average demand rose to 335 units/week (+4% from previous regime), indicating peak spring seasonality for sneaker socks is fully active.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product '3p Sneaker Socks' is currently in its peak spring/early summer season (May), which aligns with 'sneaker weather' and the high demand observations. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods for all 9 fulfilled orders. Demand analysis: the period 9-13 (last 5 weeks) shows an average demand of 319.4 units (208, 361, 392, 369, 267). While Period 13 saw a slight dip to 267, the overall trajectory since April remains very high (averaging ~320-330). I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat (covering the April-May peak more broadly) and sigma_hat to account for the \ucd5c\uadfc period-to-period volatility (ranging from 208 to 392). On-hand is 112 with 1432 units in-transit (orders from P10-P13), which is healthy for a lead time of 4. I will maintain the default lead time of 4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Sneaker Socks', which experiences peak demand during late spring and summer (May/June) as temperatures rise and people wear low-profile footwear. Recent demand data shows a sustained high-regime: Period 13 (267 units) and Period 14 (262 units) indicate a slight cooling or stabilization from the previous 300+ peak, but we remain in the seasonal high. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 330.2 units. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated by the P14 conclusion message for the P10 order). Currently, on-hand inventory is 249 units with a very healthy pipeline of 1214 units. Given lead time L=4, my parameters must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My target base stock is approximately 5 * 330 = 1650 units. Pipeline + On-hand is 1463, meaning the OR backend should order around 180-200 units. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this high-demand regime while allowing for the slight recent deceleration.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. This SKU (Sneaker Socks) is in its peak seasonal window (spring/early summer). We have observed a stable lead time of exactly 4 periods consistently from Period 5 through Period 15. Demand has stabilized into a high-demand regime; the last 5 periods (P11-P15) show demand values of 392, 369, 267, 262, and 308, averaging 319.6 units per week. Although there's a slight dip from the P11-P12 peak (~380), demand remains robust. I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect this current regime (avg ~320/week). Setting L to 'calculate' is safe given the consistency. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on the last 5 periods to capture this stabilized seasonal peak while responding to the high variance (std ~= 55). On-hand inventory is healthy (300) and pipeline is full (1158), ensuring we maintain service levels during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in a high-demand peak regime (Periods 11-15): average demand is 320 units/week (+/- 55). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442010' (3p Sneaker Socks) is currently in its peak seasonal demand phase (late spring/early summer), which aligns with the item's utility for low-profile footwear. Analysis of the most recent 10 periods (P7-P16) shows a mean weekly demand of approximately 324 units with a standard deviation of 59. This represents a stabilized high-demand regime following the rapid growth seen in March and April. The last period (P16) demand was 383, which is on the higher end of this regime, emphasizing the need to maintain a robust base stock. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P9-P12. I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture this stabilized high-demand period for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to avoid being skewed by the much lower initial demand in February.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a '3p Sneaker Sock', which typically exhibits strong demand during the warmer spring and summer months (peak seasonality). We are currently in early June (Period 18). Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) being 300.4 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 13 order in Period 17 conclusion. The pipeline inventory (1121 units) and on-hand inventory (309 units) total 1430 units. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent average of ~300 units/week, our target base stock should be roughly 1500 units. My parameters use recent_N to capture the current stabilized peak regime while maintaining responsiveness to the slight variability (standard deviation) observed during this peak to ensure sufficient safety stock without excessive holding costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '3p Sneaker Socks' is currently in its peak seasonal window (June), following a steady demand increase since February. Recent demand (Periods 13-18) has stabilized, averaging 297 units per week (min 262, max 383), showing a slight cooling from the April/May peak which averaged ~330. Currently, on-hand inventory is 210, and in-transit (pipeline) is 1,106 units (consisting of orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). The lead time remains consistent at exactly 4 periods based on 'Period 18 conclude' (P14 order arrival). To determine this period's order, I will use a recent demand window (N=6) to capture the stabilized high-demand regime, ensuring L=4 (covering L+1=5 weeks of demand). This balances the high seasonal demand against the inventory already in-transit.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which typically experiences peak demand during spring and early summer (March through June). We are currently in Period 20 (June 24), approaching mid-summer. Recent demand (Periods 15-19) has stabilized, averaging 295 units per week (308, 383, 282, 280, 301). This represents a slight cooling from the late-April peak (~320-335 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 212 units, with 1057 units in-transit (orders from P16, P17, P18, and P19). The pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable, slightly-past-peak demand regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) based on the ~295/week average.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued in June (Periods 15-19) at an average of 295 units/week, down slightly from the spring peak of 335 units/week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Analyzing recent demand history for sneaker socks (Periods 15-20), there is a stable plateau averaging 289 units/week (last 6 periods: 308, 383, 282, 280, 301, 280). This follows a slight decline from the late spring peak (May average was ~315). July typically represents sustained summer demand for sneaker socks but may see a tapering off as the season progresses. Actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals from orders in P12, P13, P14, P15, and P16). Currently, on-hand inventory is 183 units, and 1171 units are in transit. To set OR parameters for Period 21, I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this summer plateau (N=6, P15-P20). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the most recent consistent demand levels and volatility while maintaining a 4-period lead time expectation.

Carry-over insight: Demand transitioned from a spring peak (averaging ~335 in May) to a stable summer plateau (averaging 289 in June/early July). Lead time remains reliably at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $421.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '3p Sneaker Socks' is currently in a stable summer demand phase. Reviewing the last 5 periods (P17-P21), the average demand has decreased to 268 units, down from the May peak (~335). The most recent demand (P21) was 198, suggesting a potential further deceleration as we move deeper into July. The 'summer plateau' identified in previous periods remains the active regime, but I will use a slightly shorter window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent cooling trend without overreacting to the single P21 low. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all 17 completed delivery cycles. The pipeline inventory (1035) plus current on-hand (371) is healthy, but the OR engine needs adjusted mu_hat and sigma_hat targets to account for the current demand level (approx. 270/week) and its volatility (std dev approx. 45 over the last 5 weeks).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: July demand is showing signs of cooling from the June plateau; P17-P21 average is 268 units/week compared to the 289-295 seen in June.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442010' (3p Sneaker Socks) is exhibiting a seasonal decline as we move further into July. Historical demand has transitioned from a spring peak of ~335 units/week in May, through a June plateau of ~290 units/week, to a current cooling phase in July averaging 198-209 units/week. This follows a typical fashion retail calendar where sneaker sock demand peaks in late spring/early summer. The most recent demand samples are 198 and 209 (P21 and P22), significantly lower than the previous six-week average. To avoid ending the season with excessive holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to a recent_N window of 4 periods (P19-P22) to reflect the current downward trend while still maintaining a safety buffer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (880) + on-hand (328) is quite high (1208 total), suggesting the system will likely place a minimal order as it compensates for the cooling demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained July demand decrease: P21-P22 average 203.5 units vs June average 289 (-30%). Cooling phase reflects end of peak sneaker sock season.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks is entering a clear cooling phase as the peak spring/early summer season ends. Recent demand for Periods 21, 22, and 23 was 198, 209, and 188 respectively (average ~198), a significant drop from the June plateau of ~290. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this new lower demand regime using the last 3 samples. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 19 order in Period 23. Pipelines are currently high (750 units in transit) relative to this lower demand, so the OR backend will likely scale back ordering significantly to avoid excess holding costs. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat as well to capture the current volatility in this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed lower: July demand (Period 21-23) averaged 198 units/week, down ~32% from June (~290). This confirms the end of peak sneaker sock seasonality.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks is experiencing a significant post-peak cooling phase as we move through late July. Recent demand data (Periods 21-24: 198, 209, 188, 109) confirms a sharp downward trend, with Period 24 showing the lowest demand of the year since the initial ramp-up. The average demand over the last four weeks is ~176, but the most recent figure (109) suggests the actual current rate is lower. We are currently holding 650 units on-hand with 385 in-transit (reaching a pipeline of 1,035 units). Given our current inventory and the projected demand of ~100-150 units per week, we are significantly overstocked for the current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the cooling trend, and using default for sigma_hat. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend due to the high inventory-to-demand ratio.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand crash confirmed: Period 24 demand (109) is a significant drop from the already cooled July average (~200), indicating a final transition out of summer peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a late-summer/autumn cooling phase. After a peak in May (avg ~335) and a stable June (avg ~295), demand dropped significantly in July (~198) and has further crashed in the most recent two periods (avg 115). Specifically, Period 24 demand was 109 and Period 25 was 121. With the current on-hand inventory at 779 units and 181 units in-transit (expected in Period 26), total availability is 960 units. This is far in excess of the projected demand for the next 5-period window (L+1), assuming the current low-demand regime of ~115 units/week continues. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To avoid accumulating excessive holding costs ($1/unit/period) on stagnant stock, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 2 periods to reflect the new seasonal floor. This will likely result in a zero order from the OR backend as current inventory already covers approximately 8 weeks of demand at the new rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime crash confirmed: Period 24-25 average demand is 115 units/week, a ~42% drop from the July average (~198) and a ~61% drop from the June plateau (~295), marking the shift into post-summer seasonality.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a post-summer cooling phase. The current date is mid-August (2019/8/12). Recent demand (Periods 24-26) has averaged 120 units per week (109, 121, 131), significantly lower than the June/July plateau. Inventory is currently very high with 659 units on-hand and 170 in-transit (total 829), which covers over 6 weeks of current demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and the downward seasonal trend, mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted using recent_N=3 to reflect the current low-demand regime, while L remains default. The goal is to avoid further overstocking and minimize holding costs while the current excess inventory is sold through.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-308.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a late-summer/post-peak regime. After peaking in May (~335 units/week) and plateauing in June (~290), July demand fell to approx. 198 units/week. More drastically, the last four periods (P24-P27) have averaged 114 units/week (109, 121, 131, 95). Current on-hand inventory is 688 units, which is extremely high (covering over 6 periods of demand at the current rate). In-transit is only 46 units (ordered P25). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock and the continuing downward seasonal trend as we move towards autumn, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the new, lower demand level of ~114 units, allowing the inventory to bleed down without placing unnecessary new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at post-summer low: Period 24-27 average demand is 114 units/week, down ~42% from the July average (~198) and ~61% from the June plateau.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a late-summer/early-fall stabilization phase following the post-peak crash. The most recent demand samples (Periods 24-28) are 109, 121, 131, 95, and 80, averaging approximately 107 units per week. This aligns with the post-summer low regime identified in the carry-over insights. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (608 units) relative to this new demand level, as the system clears inventory ordered during the transition. With an average demand of ~107 and a lead time of 4 periods, target pipeline inventory (covering L+1=5 periods) should be around 535 units. Since on-hand (608) already exceeds this, the OR backend logic will naturally minimize ordering. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this current low-demand reality, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the reduced volatility of this stable period. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has stabilized at a post-summer low, consistent with the transition into autumn (September). Over the last 6 periods (P24-P29), demand has averaged 104 units/week (109, 121, 131, 95, 80, 88), a significant drop from the spring/summer peak of ~300. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 566 units and 0 in-transit, current stock covers more than 5 periods of forecasted demand (at ~104 units/week), exceeding the (L+1) target of 520 units. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this new lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering while the system burns through existing safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at post-summer low: Period 24-29 average demand is 104 units/week, marking a confirmed shift into autumn seasonality for sneaker socks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442010' (3p Sneaker Socks) has exited its peak spring/summer season and is now in a stable post-summer low-demand regime, which aligns with early September (Period 31). Demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 104 units per week over the last six periods (P24-P29: 109, 121, 131, 95, 80, 88, 96). The current on-hand inventory of 470 units is sufficient to cover roughly 4.5 weeks of demand at this rate. Since the lead time is 4 periods, and current pipeline inventory is 0 (all previous orders have arrived or were 0), the total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 470. Given the demand forecast of ~104 units/week, the base stock for (L+1) periods (5 periods) would be around 520 units. With 470 on hand, the system will place a small order to reach that target. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized autumn demand level while allowing for natural variance. Lead time 'L' remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has stabilized in a post-summer low regime. In September (Periods 28-31), demand has been consistently low: 80, 88, 96, 79, averaging approximately 86 units per week. This is significantly lower than the peak spring/summer months. The on-hand inventory (391) plus in-transit (79) equals 470 units, which is ample to cover the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) at the current rate (~86 * 5 = 430). Therefore, the system should focus on maintaining this lower stock level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) captures the recent stabilization at ~86 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at post-summer low: Period 28-31 average demand is 86 units/week, down from the early autumn average of 104 units seen in Period 30 data, confirming a deep seasonal cooling.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-31.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has stabilized at a significantly lower autumn level. The average demand for the most recent five periods (P28-P32) is approximately 83 units per week, which is a marked decrease from the summer and spring peaks. This lower demand is consistent with the product being a 'sneaker sock'\u2014a seasonal item that typically sells best in warmer months. On-hand inventory is currently at 319 units, which, at the current demand rate of ~83 units/week, covers nearly 4 weeks of demand. Combined with the 79 units in-transit (ordered in Period 31), the total pipeline and on-hand inventory is approximately 398 units. This is sufficient to cover about 4.8 weeks, which matches the (L+1) exposure period (L=4). Therefore, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized autumn demand regime and maintain a lean inventory to avoid high holding costs during the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at autumn low: Period 28-32 average demand is 83 units/week, confirming a deep seasonal cooling for sneaker socks as of late September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442010' (sneaker socks) is in its post-summer low-demand phase. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 183 units after several periods in the 70-100 range; however, looking at the date (Sept 23), this is likely a temporary fluctuation rather than a trend shift back to high demand, given the seasonality of invisible 'sneaker' socks. The aggregate Period 28-33 average is 100 units/week. On-hand inventory is 136 with 114 in-transit (Total pipeline: 250). Since lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At 100/week, required stock is ~500. Currently, we are under-stocked relative to this new average. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across the history. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current autumn baseline (including the recent spike) and sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product '3p Sneaker Socks' is currently in a post-summer/autumn demand phase. Since Period 31, there's been a noticeable decrease in demand, with recent periods showing fluctuations between 50 and 183 units. Specifically, Period 34 demand was low (50 units). The average demand over the last 4 completed periods (P31-P34) is approx 96 units, though Period 33 was an outlier at 183. Given the seasonal nature of sneaker socks (intended to be hidden), demand typically remains lower in colder months. On-hand inventory is 86, and in-transit is 283 (which includes orders from P31 and P33 expected to arrive shortly). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the cooling autumn demand, while maintaining a standard sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at autumn levels: Period 31-34 average is 96 units/week, with occasional volatility (e.g., P33 spikes).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a stable, low-volume autumn regime. During the last 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 85.4 units per week, despite a single spike in Period 33. This is significantly lower than the spring/summer peak (>300) and the July cooling phase (~200). With the current date being mid-October, we are well past the peak season for hidden sneaker socks. Inventory management must now focus on avoiding excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for this lower demand profile. On-hand inventory (122) plus the recent incoming shipments (ordered P33, P34, P35 totaling 398) provides a healthy cushion. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the recent 5-period average (approx 85/week) to align the base stock with the current seasonal reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at autumn low: Period 31-35 average demand is 85 units/week, down from the early autumn average of 104 units, confirming a deep seasonal cooling as winter approaches.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for sneaker socks has stabilized at a late autumn low. Over the last 6 periods (P31-P36), demand has averaged 80 units/week (79, 72, 183, 50, 43, 51), though Period 33 was an outlier at 183. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 71 units, and in-transit inventory is 412 units (orders from P33, P34, P35, P36). The total pipeline plus on-hand is 483 units, which comfortably covers over 5 periods of expected demand at current levels (~80-100 units/week). My objective is to maintain availability while minimizing holding costs as we enter the low season. I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma to capture the current stable autumn regime, specifically focusing on the last 6 periods to include the recent low-demand signals while accounting for the P33 volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed stable autumn low-demand regime: Period 31-36 average demand is 80 units/week (excluding the P33 spike, average is 59), reflecting late-season cooling for sneaker socks.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has stabilized in a late-autumn/early-winter low-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent data (excluding the Period 33 spike), the average demand from Period 31 to Period 37 is approximately 63 units/week (P31:79, P32:72, P33:183-outlier, P34:50, P35:43, P36:51, P37:53). Current on-hand inventory is 53 units, and there are 392 units in-transit (P34:169, P35:194, P36:14, P37:15). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high in-transit volume relative to the current low demand (over 6 weeks of coverage already in the pipeline), the goal is to prevent further inventory ballooning as we enter November. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand state and use the calculate method for lead time as it has been reliably 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Sneaker socks are entering their deep autumn/winter low-demand regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has been 50, 43, 51, 53, 62, producing an average of 51.8 units/week. This is significantly lower than the P31-P35 average of 85, confirming a final seasonal drop as winter approaches. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P31, P33, and P34). Current on-hand (160) plus in-transit (271) equals 431 units, which covers approximately 8 weeks of current demand. With the game ending in Period 47 (9 periods remaining), we must avoid over-stocking during this terminal low-demand phase. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the most recent 5-period regime (approx 52 units/week) to stabilize inventory levels and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Average demand decreased from ~85 to ~52 units/week (-39%), characterizing the late-autumn/pre-winter low for sneaker socks.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product (sneaker socks) is in its late-autumn/pre-winter low-demand phase. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level following the summer and early autumn cooling. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 50.3 units/week (specifically 50, 43, 51, 53, 62, 43). This is a clear regime shift from the early autumn average of ~85 identified in Period 36. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 311 units, which is more than enough to cover the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1 \u2248 250 units) even without further arrivals. The 'In-transit' quantity is 77 units (comprising orders from P36, P37, and P38), which will further increase inventory in the coming weeks. Therefore, to minimize holding costs while demand is at its seasonal trough, I am setting mu_hat to reflect this current regime using the last 6 samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late-autumn/winter low: Period 34-39 average demand is 50.3 units/week, down from the early autumn average of ~85.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). The product is sneaker socks, which are highly seasonal and have entered a stable late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P34-P40), the average demand is 51.1 units/week, with very low volatility (sigma ~7.3). This confirms the 'late-autumn/winter low' identified in the previous period's carry-over. On-hand inventory is currently high at 269 units, and there are 63 units in-transit (P37: 15, P38: 48). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 332 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1 (covering 5 periods of demand), the expected requirement is approximately 5 * 51 = 255 units. Since 332 > 255, we are currently overstocked for this demand regime. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect the stabilized low regime clearly, while maintaining L at calculate (observed 4) and sigma_hat at recent_N (N=7) to account for the low variance. No ordering is expected from the OR backend because current inventory is significantly above the base stock level.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has stabilized at a late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 34-41), the average demand is approximately 52 units per week, which is consistent with the seasonal expectations for this product type in November. The on-hand inventory is 240 units and there are 48 units in-transit (ordered Period 38, due to arrive in Period 42). Total pipeline inventory is 288 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, our target base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) should be approximately 260-280 units (5 * 52). Since our current pipeline inventory (288) already exceeds this coverage, the system should not place new orders. To ensure the OR backend aligns with this logic and avoids over-ordering, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the low-demand regime since Period 34, and maintaining L at default (4).

Demand at Period 42 showed a spike to 140 units, but historical data for late autumn and winter (Periods 34-41) has consistently averaged ~50 units/week. This recent spike is likely transient or related to a promotion, rather than a structural regime shift, given the product type (hidden sneaker socks) is not a winter staple. On-hand inventory is 148 units, which covers nearly 3 weeks of the recent average demand. Pipeline inventory is currently 0 as all prior orders (up to Period 38) have arrived. To avoid overstocking during the off-season and incurring high holding costs ($1/unit/period), I will maintain the mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent winter regime (last 9 periods, P34-P42, average ~60 units/week). This approach balances the risk of the recent spike against the seasonal trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Transient demand spike in Period 42 (140 units) noted, but seasonal context (sneaker socks in December) suggests maintaining the late-autumn/winter low-demand regime (avg ~60 units/week).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442010' (3p Sneaker Socks) is in a late-autumn/winter low-demand phase. Current date is Dec 9, 2019. Historically, demand for this product dropped significantly from the spring/summer peak (approx 300 units/week) to a stabilized low (approx 50-60 units/week) starting around Period 34. A transient spike occurred in Period 42 (140 units), likely due to a promotion or early holiday shopping, but Period 43 returned to the low regime (24 units). Average demand for the last 10 periods (P34-P43) is approximately 58 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent completed cycles. On-hand inventory is 124 units, and in-transit is 111 units (ordered in P43). Given the current demand regime, a stock level covering (L+1) i.e., 5 weeks of demand is targeted. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the late-season average of ~58 units/week, while allowing for some variability observed in the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed in low winter phase: Period 34-43 average demand is 58.6 units/week, despite a one-off spike in Period 42.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442010' (Sneaker Socks) is currently in its late winter/off-season trough. Period 44 demand was very low at 19 units, following 24 units in Period 43. While Period 42 saw a spike of 140, the broader context of sneaker socks in December suggests this was an outlier or a brief gift-buying spike, rather than a regime shift. The 'Carry-over Insights' correctly identify the regime since Period 34 as averaging approximately 58.6 units/week (even including the spike). Without the spike, the average over the last 10 periods is closer to 45-50 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the recent 11 periods (P34-P44) to capture the winter low while acknowledging the volatility observed in Period 42 to ensure sigma_hat provides enough safety buffer. This will prevent over-stocking during the off-season where holding costs exceed potential lost profit from small stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime confirmed (P34-P44): average demand is ~55 units/week, characterized by periodic late-season volatility (e.g., P42 spike) but generally low baseline demand for sneaker socks.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. We are in the depths of the winter low-demand regime for sneaker socks. Historical demand for the most recent periods (P43-P45) has dropped further to an average of 23 units/week (24, 19, 26), which is lower than the previous winter average of ~55. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 79 units on-hand and 221 units in-transit (ordered in P43, P44, P45), the pipeline is currently very high relative to the present demand. My goal is to allow the OR backend to restrict further ordering by acknowledging the sustained low demand. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the winter baseline (approx 50 units/week) while smoothing out the P42 spike, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current lower volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand trough intensified: 3-period average (P43-P45) dropped to 23 units/week, down from the P34-P43 average of 58 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442010' (sneaker socks) is in its deepest seasonal trough as the year ends (late December). The average demand over the last three periods (P44-P46) has fallen to 23.3 units/week, significantly lower than the P34-P43 average of 58.6. This aligns with the seasonal expectation that low-cut sneaker socks have minimal demand in mid-winter. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (observed consistently throughout history). Current on-hand inventory is 54 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 245 units (ordered P43 onwards), which is more than sufficient for the next several periods of low demand. To prevent further accumulation of excess inventory during this trough, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (last 3 periods) to capture the current trough depth of ~23 units/week. Since the backend calculates base stock as (1+L)*mu, choosing N=3 for mu_hat will set a baseline reflecting the current low demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand trough intensified: 3-period average (P44-P46) dropped to 23.3 units/week, confirming the seasonal low for sneaker socks.
