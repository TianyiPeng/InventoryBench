Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 610776001 (Tilly T-shirt). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no on-hand inventory or in-transit shipments, we need to establish a base stock immediately. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a rising trend (145, 144, 105, 181, 212), with an average of 157.4 units/week. Given the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt and we are moving into mid-February, we should expect steady or slightly increasing demand as spring approaches. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent average demand (157.4) and volatility, while using 'default' for lead time since we have no delivery history yet. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx 787 units).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Period 1 showed a demand of 206 units, while the pre-game historical mean (5 samples) was approximately 157.4 units. Since on-hand inventory was 0 in Period 1, no units were sold. An order of 225 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods (expected arrival in Period 5). Given the the demand of 206 is significantly higher than the initial history, I will use recent samples to inform the forecast. With only one period of gameplay history, I will use N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the upward pressure from the P1 demand (206) and the most recent history. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4 until arrival data suggests otherwise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the orders from P1 and P2 (totaling 452 units) have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in the P6 decision phase. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) range from 105 to 212 (mean: 157.4). However, observed demand in P1 and P2 (Feb 11, Feb 18) spiked to 206 and 239, suggesting a higher demand regime as we move into the spring season. Because we have zero stock and the next 2-3 periods will also likely have zero stock until P1's order arrives, it is critical to set parameters that cover the replenishment cycle. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend in demand more effectively than the full history, while keeping lead time at the default promised value since we haven't seen any arrivals yet to prove otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a basic T-shirt. Observed demand in the first 3 periods (206, 239, 350) is significantly higher than the initial historical samples (ranging 105-212), indicating a strong upward trend or seasonal entry into spring. No units have arrived yet because the promised lead time is 4 periods; the first order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5. Therefore, we currently have 0 on-hand and 725 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3). Given the clear upward momentum in demand (P3 was 350), using the 'default' or a wide average would underestimate the base stock needed to cover the lead time + 1 period. To avoid stockouts when the pipeline begins arriving, I will use recent trends. I'm selecting N=3 for demand to capture the recent surge and setting L to default (4) as no actual lead time data is available yet.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Historical demand shows an upward trend (145, 144, 105, 181, 212) followed by the most recent four concluded periods (206, 239, 350, 260). The average demand over these 9 samples is ~216. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (current period), but results will only be visible in P5's conclusion (P6 start). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 1115 in-transit (P1-P4 orders: 225+227+273+390 = 1115). Since no orders have arrived yet and the promised lead time is 4, this is expected behavior. I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the periods from P4 back to the initial sample) to capture the higher recent demand levels while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Demand history (pre-game and game periods) shows: 145, 144, 105, 181, 212, 206, 239, 350, 260, 245. Average demand is approx 218 units/period. The Period 1 order (225 units) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of L=4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 1240 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). In-transit inventory covers approximately 5.6 periods of average demand. The OR backend uses a base stock policy (L+1) and a cap. Given L=4, the pipeline should cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Current in-transit (1240) is slightly above the expected pipeline need (218 * 5 = 1090). However, demand spiked in P3 (350) and has remained consistently higher than the pre-game mean (~157). I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-demand regime (mean ~260 over the last 5 periods) while relying on the 'calculate' method for lead time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~157 (pre-game) to ~260 (last 5 game periods), a ~65% increase. Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU 610776001 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historically, demand has increased from a pre-game average of ~157 to a game average of ~257 (Periods 1-6). Demand in the last four periods has been 350, 260, 245, and 242 (Mean: 274). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for all periods) because initial orders didn't account for the shifted demand and lead time delay. Arrival of the Period 3 order (273 units) is expected during Period 7 resolution and will be visible in Period 8. To ensure the backend covers the next 5 periods (L+1), I will use the recent 6 periods of game data to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the currently higher and more volatile demand regime compared to the pre-game samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Reviewing history: Demand has been higher than early samples, with the last three periods showing 245, 242, and 448 (average ~311). The demand spike in Period 7 (448) may be a peak related to spring seasonality/Easter preparations. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7), meaning orders cover a cycle of L+1 = 5 periods. Critical Observation: We currently have 0 on-hand inventory because demand has consistently exceeded the stock arriving (Lost Sales are occurring). Total in-transit is 1192 units. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent demand surge, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average demand ~309) to capture the higher regime without over-extrapolating from the single outlier of 448. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility (Std Dev ~86). Lead time L is set to 'default' as confirmed lead time matches promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift updated at Period 8: Mean demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7) has risen to ~309 vs ~157 (pre-game). Significant demand spike observed on 2019-03-25 (Period 7) likely seasonal.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Demand context: The last 5 game periods (P4-P8) show a mean demand of 335.4 units (260, 245, 242, 448, 382), which is significantly higher than the pre-game mean (~157). The spike in Period 7 (448) and sustained high demand in Period 8 (382) suggest an upward trend as we move into spring for this t-shirt SKU. In-transit arrivals (lead time = 4) have been consistent. We have 8 units on-hand and 1259 in-transit (orders from P5-P8). To account for the recent demand surge and the coming weeks, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this higher regime. I will use the last 5 periods for sigma_hat as well to reflect the increased volatility (std dev ~91). Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 9: Mean demand from Periods 4-8 has increased to ~335 units, driven by significant spikes in late March/early April (likely seasonal spring demand for t-shirts).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, and current dates (mid-April) align with the spring/summer seasonal ramp-up. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: pre-game mean was ~157, but the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9) have averaged ~321 units. Specifically, Period 7 and 8 saw spikes (448 and 382), while Period 9 moderated slightly to 284. Given the seasonal nature of basic T-shirts in spring, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this elevated demand mean of ~321 and its associated volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (promised = actual). Pipeline inventory is high (1380 units), which includes orders from Period 6 through 9. This should maintain availability as long as the OR parameters properly reflect the current (L+1) exposure window. Setting L to default (4) and using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the current spring demand regime correctly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 9: Mean demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is ~321, confirming a sustained seasonal increase from pre-game levels. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

As of Period 11 (2019/04/22), the 'Tilly' women's T-shirt is in its peak seasonal demand phase. Historically, demand from Periods 6-10 has averaged 325.8 units, significantly higher than the pre-game mean of ~157. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (L=4), meaning orders placed now cover demand for Period 16. The high profit margin ($19.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0) dictates a high service level (q=0.95). In-transit inventory stands at 1592, which covers roughly 4.8 periods of current mean demand, aligning well with the L+1 coverage requirement. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand regime confirmed: Mean demand from Periods 6-10 is ~326 units, consistently double the pre-game level. Lead time L=4 is stable based on continuous arrivals from Period 5 through 10.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019/4/29). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its peak spring/early summer seasonal demand phase. Historically, demand has increased significantly from the pre-game mean of 157. Over the last 5 periods (P7-P11), demand has been 448, 382, 284, 273, and 410, resulting in a mean of 359.4. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P7 order arrived in P11). In Period 11, we stocked out (ending on-hand = 0) because arrival (193) plus starting inventory (60) was only 253 units against a demand of 410. We have 1,693 units in-transit, with a large order of 457 from P8 expected to arrive in Period 12. Given high profitability ($19 vs $1 holding cost), maximizing the service level is critical. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent volatility and elevated volume.

Carry-over insight: Current high-demand regime (Periods 7-11) mean verified at ~359 units, up from ~326 in the previous window, confirming the seasonal peak for T-shirts continues.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in the midst of a sustained high-demand regime for this lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is consistent with seasonal spring/summer trends. Over the last 5 periods (P8-P12), the mean demand has reached approximately 339 units. Although there was a peak of 410 in Period 11, the demand in Period 12 settled at 345, suggesting the regime is stable but volatile. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals. With an on-hand inventory of 112 and a large in-transit pipeline (1626 units), current inventory plus incoming orders is sufficient to cover the 5-period window (L+1). I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period demand average to capture this seasonal plateau and maintain a robust safety stock via standard sigma calculation to protect against the high variability observed in late March and April.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand regime remains high: Mean demand for Periods 8-12 is ~339 units, confirming a consolidated seasonal level relative to pre-game averages. Lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the item is a women's T-shirt, which is currently in a sustained high-demand seasonal regime. The lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of Periods 5 through 13). Recent demand patterns (Periods 9-13: 284, 273, 410, 345, 280) show a mean of 318.4 units per period. While slightly lower than the window observed at Period 12, it remains significantly elevated above pre-game levels. A high service level (q = 19/20 = 95%) is targeted due to high profit margin relative to holding cost. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current seasonal mean and volatility accurately while responding to the recent minor fluctuations in the peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime continues into mid-May: Mean demand for Periods 9-13 is ~318 units, reinforcing the seasonal pattern for jersey T-shirts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), the SKU 610776001 (Women's Jersey T-shirt) remains in a high-demand seasonal regime typical for spring/early summer. Demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has averaged ~323 units (273, 410, 345, 280, 309). This is consistent with previous analysis (~318 to ~359). The lead time is very stable at exactly 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 14. Current on-hand inventory is 465, with a pipeline of 1035 units (ordered in P11-P14). Since the product profit is significantly higher than the holding cost ($19 vs $1), the target service level is high (~95%). I am setting L to 'calculate' because historical lead times are perfectly consistent. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=5 to capture the stable but elevated demand level observed over the last 5 weeks of the current seasonal period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are in the midst of the spring/summer peak for Women's Everyday Basics T-shirts. Historical demand for the last five periods (P11-P15) has a mean of 336.2 units, which is consistent with the established high-demand regime of ~320-360 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P15 of the order placed in P11. With On-hand inventory at 422 units and In-transit at 1065 units (representing orders from P12-P15), we have a healthy pipeline. I will continue to use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand seasonality accurately, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed high-demand regime persists through late May; mean demand for P11-P15 is 336.2 units. Pipeline replenishment remains synchronized with L=4.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the demand for this women's jersey T-shirt remains in a sustained high-demand seasonal regime. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 353 units, which is consistent with the late-spring/early-summer peak. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P8 through P12. The OR backend needs to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95% critical ratio). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime while filtering out earlier, lower demand data. Calculating L based on historical consistency ensures the replenishment cycle remains synced. On-hand plus pipeline inventory (420 + 1048 = 1468) is currently adequate to cover the lead time demand, and these parameters will help the OR engine maintain appropriate safety stocks as the season progresses.

Carry-over insight: Early June demand update: Mean demand for P12-P16 is 353 units, suggesting the seasonal high regime is stable heading into summer. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is in its peak summer seasonal window. Analysis of historical demand for the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17: 280, 309, 337, 392, 357) shows a mean of 335 units. This confirms that the high-demand regime is stable. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, verified by the arrival of shipments from P9 through P13 exactly 4 periods after ordering. On-hand inventory is 239, and with 1222 units in-transit, the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will continue to use N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stable seasonal high, while maintaining L at the promised value of 4 as it is performing reliably.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5946.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (2019/6/17), the current date reflects mid-June, where demand for lightweight jersey T-shirts remains high. The lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 14 order in Period 18. Demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) has averaged 333 units, while the more recent window (P16-P18) averaged 356 units, indicating the seasonal plateau is well-sustained. Current on-hand inventory is 96 units, with a very large pipeline (In-transit: 1420 units) covering the next 4 periods of logic. To ensure the backend correctly projects demand over the review + lead time window (5 periods total), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current 333-unit mean, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This maintains the high service level required for the $19 profit margin while mitigating excess holding costs as we near the end of the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Mid-June demand update: Mean demand for P14-P18 is 333 units, confirming the peak summer season for jersey basics is still active. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (2019/06/24), we are in the peak summer season for women's jersey T-shirts. The demand for the last five periods (P15-P19) has averaged 346.6 units (337, 392, 357, 318, 329), confirming a stable high-demand regime consistent with previous summer observations. The lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods, with every order from Period 1 through Period 15 arriving exactly in 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 91 units, and the pipeline is well-filled (1416 units) to cover the 4-period lead time. I will maintain the current strategy using a recent_N window (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current high-selling summer trend without being overly influenced by lower spring start values. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that maximizes profit (critical for this high-margin 19:1 profit-to-holding ratio item) while the order cap prevents excessive overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime verified: Average demand for P15-P19 remains high at ~347 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019-07-01), we are in the peak summer period for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history (e.g., Period 16 order arrived in Period 20). My demand analysis shows a stable high-demand regime: the mean demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 344.4 units, which is consistent with the mid-summer average of ~347 units reported in Period 20. There is no evidence of a downward shift yet, and given the product category (lightweight jersey basics), demand is expected to remain firm through July. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current summer plateau and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the recent stabilization in demand volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the actual performance matches the promised 4 periods perfectly.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 22 (2019/07/08). The SKU 610776001 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt', which is in peak summer demand. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) showed a mean of 310.6 units, but P21 alone saw a dip to 223. Given the seasonality and consistent high demand from Periods 7 through 20 (mean ~330-350), I am treating the P21 dip as a possible outlier or the beginning of a normalization rather than a collapse. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent trend while maintaining sensitivity to the high-demand summer regime. The lead time L is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to reflect this stability. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current volatility (std dev of P17-P21 is ~54). Pipeline inventory is high (1346), so the OR backend's capped policy will ensure we don't over-order if the base stock is already covered.

Carry-over insight: Early July demand update: Mean demand for P17-P21 decreased slightly to ~311 units (down from ~347 in previous window), influenced by a lower demand observation in P21. Summer peak may be stabilizing or beginning a slight decline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-15. We are seeing a significant decline in demand over the last two periods (P21: 223, P22: 173) compared to the mid-summer average of ~347. This suggests the peak season for lightweight jersey T-shirts is winding down as we move into mid-to-late July. The lead time L=4 is stable and confirmed by regular arrivals from Periods 13 through 18. Given the falling demand, using a long history for forecasting would result in over-ordering and high holding costs. I am transitioning to a recent_N strategy (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this downward trend more aggressively (average demand P19-P22 is ~262 compared to the pre-drop average of ~340). I will use a larger N=10 for sigma_hat to maintain a safety buffer against volatility during this regime shift. Pipeline inventory is currently high (1104 in-transit), so the OR backend will likely scale back orders naturally to prevent excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 22: Demand for lightweight jersey T-shirts is declining from the summer peak (~347) to a new lower level (P22 demand: 173). Moving from peak summer into late summer seasonality.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/22. Demand for the last two periods has dropped significantly (173 and 161) compared to the summer peak average of ~340. This confirms a seasonal decline as we move out of peak summer for lightweight jersey T-shirts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (624) and substantial in-transit units (784), the pipeline is currently oversupplied for this new lower-demand regime. To prevent excessive holding costs, I am reducing mu_hat by using recent_N (N=3) to capture the downturn (avg ~185) and setting a conservative sigma_hat. This will result in the OR backend placing zero or very small orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 23: Summer peak has ended; demand has dropped from ~340 to ~167 average over the last two weeks (P22-P23).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2502.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment has shifted from a high-demand summer peak (avg ~340) to a significantly lower late-summer regime. Demand over the last three periods (P22-P24) has been 173, 161, and 173, averaging approximately 169 units per week. This reflects the end of the seasonal peak for 'Women's Everyday Basics' t-shirts as we move into late July. On-hand inventory is currently high at 785 units, with an additional 450 units in transit (ordered in P21 and P22). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set parameters based on the new, lower demand level (recent_N=3) to prevent excessive holding costs. Given that 785 on-hand + 450 in-transit (1235 total) far exceeds the expected demand for the (L+1)=5 period window (approx 169 * 5 = 845), the OR backend should correctly suppress new orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand drop confirmed: Mean demand for Periods 22-24 is ~169 units, down from the peak summer average of ~340 units (-50%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1116.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey t-shirt has clearly transitioned from a summer peak (~340 units) to a significantly lower late-summer/fall level. The last four periods (P22-P25) show demand of 173, 161, 173, and 111, averaging approximately 154 units. With on-hand inventory at 993 units, we currently hold over 6 periods of supply at this new demand rate, which already exceeds the required base stock (L+1 coverage). Therefore, I am continuing with an order of zero by setting parameters that reflect the current lower demand and stable lead time. Specifically, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the demand drop since Period 22. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-summer demand (P22-P25) has stabilized at a mean of ~154 units, a 55% reduction from the summer peak. On-hand inventory is significantly elevated relative to this new demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $796.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic' T-shirts has clearly transitioned from a summer peak (approx. 340 units/period) to a significantly lower late-summer/autumn regime. Over the last five periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged approximately 143 units, with the most recent two periods dropping below 115. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 1028 units, which covers over 7-9 periods of current demand levels. No units are in transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods and the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover the (L+1) window (5 periods) even at the previous high-demand levels, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand drop using the last 5 samples to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the new regime, which will result in the OR backend producing a zero order due to the high on-hand surplus.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 27: Average demand for P22-P26 has fallen to ~143 units (-58% from summer peak). Recent two weeks (P25-P26) show even lower stabilization around ~100 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey' has entered a significantly lower, stable regime following its summer peak. In Period 27 (mid-August), demand was 84 units, following a trend (P22-P27) with a mean of ~133 units and the most recent three periods averaging ~97 units. On-hand inventory is currently 944 units, which is extremely high (nearly 10 periods of supply) given the current demand regime and zero in-transit shipments. The strategy remains to place zero orders by setting parameters that result in a base stock lower than current inventory. I am using recent_N=6 to capture the post-summer decline (Periods 22-27) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals up to Period 26.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed (P22-P27): Mean demand has decreased to ~133 units (a ~60% drop from summer peak). Recent demand (P25-P27) suggests a potential lower floor near ~100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1256.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory (834 units) is extremely high relative to the new low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P25-P28) is approximately 100 units (111, 96, 84, 110). With a lead time of 4 periods, total expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1) is roughly 500 units. Since current on-hand inventory (834) already significantly exceeds this, no new orders should be placed. I will adjust the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using recent_N=7 to capture the post-summer decline (P22-P28), which averages ~130 units. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the lower demand baseline while the system naturally burns through the existing stock surplus. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand floor confirmed: Mean demand for P25-P28 is ~100 units, representing a significant stabilization below the initial post-peak transition (~150 units). Highly elevated on-hand inventory relative to current demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P30 (2019-09-02). Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt has stabilized at a low post-summer floor. Over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), demand values were 111, 96, 84, 110, 109, resulting in a mean of 102 units. Current on-hand inventory is 725 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current mean of ~102, the requirement is approx 510 units. Since on-hand (725) already exceeds this coverage requirement and there is no indication of a volume increase in early September, the goal remains to deplete excess inventory and avoid holding costs. I will set mu_hat to 102 (using recent_N=5) and L to default (4) to reflect the new demand floor. The OR backend will naturally result in an order of 0 because on-hand exceeds the base_stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor confirmed for September: Mean demand for P25-P29 is ~102 units, consistent across the last 5 weeks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The product, a lightweight jersey T-shirt, has moved past its summer peak and settled into a stable late-season/fall demand floor. The demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) has been 96, 84, 110, 109, and 74 units, yielding a mean of 94.6 units. This confirms the 'post-summer floor' mentioned in previous carry-over insights. On-hand inventory is currently 651 units with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate of ~100 units per period, this inventory covers approximately 6.5 periods of demand. This is well above the (L+1) = 5 periods of inventory needed to satisfy demand during the 4-period lead time. No new orders are needed at this stage; maintaining a base stock calculation while on-hand remains significantly elevated is appropriate. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the stabilized demand floor of ~100 units per week.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor stabilized: Mean demand for P26-P30 is 94.6 units, approximately 70% lower than the summer peak.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly (1) Everyday Basic T-shirt' has stabilized at a significantly lower level following the summer peak. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 89.8 units (84, 110, 109, 74, 72). Current on-hand inventory is 579 units with 0 units in-transit. Comparing this to the current demand regime, we have approximately 6.5 periods of stock on-hand (579 / 89.8), which is well above the required safety stock for the lead time L=4. Since the on-hand inventory already significantly exceeds the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon, no new orders are necessary. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the most recent 5-week 'floor' regime (N=5) and maintain the lead time at the promised 4 periods, which will naturally result in a zero order from the OR backend.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt (610776001) has stabilized at a significantly lower 'post-summer' level. Over the last five periods (P28-P32), demand has averaged approximately 87 units (110, 109, 74, 72, 70). Current on-hand inventory is 509 units, while there are no units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, my total inventory covers roughly 6 weeks of demand at the current rate (509 / 87 \u2248 5.85). Since the base-stock target (L+1 periods of demand) would be approximately 435 units (5 * 87) plus a safety stock buffer, the current inventory level of 509 is still slightly above the required level but approaching the threshold where ordering may resume soon. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this stabilized low-demand regime and prevent the OR engine from over-ordering based on older, high-summer data. I will monitor for a transition into autumn/winter demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed (P28-P32): Mean demand has settled at ~87 units, reflecting a further slight decline from the late-August floor of ~100. High on-hand inventory (509) continues to satisfy demand without new orders.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The 'September demand floor' for this T-shirt SKU has solidified over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) with a mean demand of approximately 80 units (70-110 range), which is a significant drop from the summer peak. We currently have 435 units on hand, which is more than enough to cover over 5 weeks of demand at the current rate (80 * 5 = 400). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory position is so high relative to the current low-demand regime, the OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally result in zero or near-zero orders. I am setting mu_hat to reflect the last 5 periods of demand to ensure the backend uses the most relevant low-demand data. Sigma_hat is also set to recent performance to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand floor confirmed: Mean demand for P29-P33 is ~80 units, showing a stable low-demand environment following the post-summer decline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Women's Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirts' has continued its seasonal decline, settling into a stable autumn floor. The most recent demand (Period 34) was 46 units, and the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 67.2 units. Current on-hand inventory is 389 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the expected demand for the next (L+1) periods (approx. 5 * 67.2 = 336 units), even with a lead time of 4. There is no risk of stockout; rather, the focus remains on depleting the existing high inventory to minimize holding costs. I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current low-demand regime. No significant new ordering is required as on-hand stock is sufficient.

Carry-over insight: October demand floor established: Mean demand for P30-P34 has dropped further to ~67 units, reflecting late-autumn lows for basic t-shirts.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 36 (mid-October). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which has exhibited a significant seasonal decline from a summer peak of ~350 units/period to a current autumn floor. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 59.2 units. On-hand inventory is 355 units, which is extremely high (approximately 6 periods of supply) given the current low-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since current inventory (355) + in-transit (25) = 380 far exceeds any reasonable base stock level for a mean demand of ~60 (Base stock would be approx (1+4)*60 + safety stock \u2248 300+), no new significant ordering is required. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand environment (N=5) to ensure the backend recognizes the floor and burns off existing stock.

Carry-over insight: October demand floor confirmed: Mean demand for P31-P35 has dropped to ~59 units, continuing the downward seasonal trend for jersey basics into late autumn.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt continues its seasonal decline as we move deeper into October. The mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) has settled at 53.4 units, down from the September floor of ~95. The current on-hand inventory is 312 units, which is approximately 5.8 times the current weekly demand. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are effectively covered for nearly 6 weeks of sales, which far exceeds the target safety stock levels for this product's profit-to-holding-cost ratio. I am choosing N=5 for the demand forecast to capture the most recent late-autumn stabilization. Since inventory is so high (312 units vs a weekly demand of ~53), no new orders are expected to be generated by the OR backend, which is appropriate as we aim to bleed down excess stock before the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: October demand floor confirmed: Mean demand for P32-P36 has dropped to 53.4 units, continuing the seasonal decline for jersey basics into late autumn.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019, entering late autumn/winter. Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt (SKU 610776001) has continued its seasonal decline, with the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) sitting at approximately 49.2 units. This is a significant drop from the summer peak (~340) and even the September stabilization (~100). On-hand inventory is currently at 265 units, which provides approximately 5.4 periods of coverage based on the recent mean. With a lead time of 4 periods, total coverage needed (L+1) is 5 periods of demand. Current inventory is sufficient to meet demand without additional ordering, especially as the seasonal trend remains downward. Expected arrivals from Period 34 (23 units) will further bolster the inventory buffer logic in future periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the late-autumn demand floor and minimize holding costs while the inventory levels naturally bleed down.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime confirmed (P33-P37): Mean demand has decreased to ~49 units, continuing the seasonal decline from the September floor (~100 units).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (2019/11/04), the demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a deep seasonal decline. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has dropped to 39.2 units, significantly lower than the late-summer floor (~100 units). On-hand inventory is currently 264 units, which at the current burn rate covers over 6 periods of demand. This is ample considering the promised lead time (L) of 4. Recent arrivals (P37, P38) confirm that the actual lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory + small in-transit (14 units) already exceeds the required base stock levels for this low-demand regime, the OR engine will likely result in zero or minimal orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the late-autumn demand floor and prevent over-ordering as the game nears its final periods (P47).

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime confirmed (P34-P38): Mean demand has decreased further to ~39 units, reflecting seasonal lows for lightweight seasonal items in November.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, entering late autumn/early winter. Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has dropped significantly from the summer peak (~340 units) to a late-autumn regime. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 38.6 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in P37 and P38. My current on-hand inventory is 221 units, which at the current demand rate of ~39 units/week, covers approximately 5.6 periods of demand. Since the lead time is 4 periods and the system reviews every period (L+1 = 5 periods), the current inventory is sufficient to cover the pipeline requirements without placing new significant orders. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current low-demand seasonal regime while maintaining the default lead time. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend given the inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime confirmed (P35-P39): Mean demand has decreased to ~39 units, reflecting seasonal lows for lightweight jersey basics. Inventory levels are currently sufficient to cover the next 5 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November), and the demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is at its seasonal low. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 37.8 units, which aligns with the 'late-autumn' regime identified in carry-over insights. Current on-hand inventory is 191 units, and there are 14 units in-transit (ordered P38, expected arrival resolution P42). With a total pipeline of 205 units and a forecasted demand of ~38 units per period, we have over 5 periods of supply on hand, which is more than enough to cover the lead time (L=4) plus current period demand (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, the OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will naturally result in zero orders. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent 5-period average (recent_N=5) to accurately capture the current low-demand floor and avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the year.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late November (P42, 2019-11-25) for a lightweight jersey T-shirt. Demand has continued to decline seasonally, with the most recent sample (P41) reaching 25 units. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 34.2 units. Current on-hand inventory is 166 units, which is approximately 5-6 weeks of cover at the current demand rate. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the seasonal nature of the product (summer basic), demand is likely to remain at or near these seasonal lows through December. Since current inventory (166) plus in-transit (37) far exceeds the expected demand over the next lead time (L+1=5 periods), there is no immediate need for aggressive replenishment. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the current late-autumn demand regime, and L to default (4). The backend calculation for base_stock will naturally result in zero or minimal ordering due to the high on-hand surplus.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (P37-P41) mean confirmed at 34.2 units, a continued decline from the summer peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43), entering the deepest part of winter for 'Womens Everyday Basics' lightweight jersey T-shirts. Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn/winter floor. The mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) is 33.8 units, consistent with the regime notes from Period 42 (34.2 units). Inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 166 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand at current rates. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P38 order arriving in P42). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this seasonal low and maintain current service levels while accounting for the existing pipeline.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/09), the demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a late-autumn/early-winter seasonal low. The mean demand over the last five periods (P39-P43) is 33.0 units, significantly lower than the summer peak. On-hand inventory is 113 units, and there are 75 units in transit (ordered in P41, P42, P43). The backend base stock calculation will use L=4 (promised and verified lead time) and a demand window of N=5 to capture the current low-regime mean and variance. With 188 total units (on-hand + in-transit) and a mean demand of ~33, the system is well-covered for the (L+1)=5 period horizon, which requires approximately 165 units. The parameters ensure we maintain a lean inventory to minimize holding costs while the backend policy caps any unnecessary ordering during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn/Winter demand regime stabilized (P39-P43): Mean demand has reached a floor of ~33 units per period, a 90% reduction from the summer peak (~340).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has stabilized at a late-autumn/winter floor. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is 28.2 units (30, 25, 47, 20, 19). This is significantly lower than the summer peak and even the post-summer stabilization levels. The product is a lightweight jersey basic, which naturally sees lower demand in mid-December. Current inventory status: On-hand is 94 units, and In-transit is 95 units (consisting of orders from P41, P42, P43, P44). Total pipeline inventory is 189 units. Given the current demand mean of ~28 units/period, this inventory covers approximately 6.7 periods, which exceeds the lead-time window (L=4). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P37, P38, P42 conclude). Therefore, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this winter floor for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L. No aggressive ordering is needed as we approach the end of the game (P47).

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed (P40-P44): Mean demand has stabilized at ~28 units, reflecting the seasonal low for lightweight jersey basics in December.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019 (Period 46). We are in a winter low-demand regime for lightweight jersey T-shirts. The mean demand for the last five periods (P41-P45) is approximately 29.2 units, which aligns with the observed winter floor of ~28-33 units. On-hand inventory is currently 82 units, and there are 72 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P42, P43, and P44). Given that the game ends at Period 47, we only need to cover demand for the remaining 2 periods. Our current total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit = 154) is already more than sufficient to cover the expected demand (~60 units) for the remainder of the game. Therefore, the OR backend should not place any additional orders. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current winter mean and use recent_N to capture the lower volatility of this period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is experiencing seasonal lows during the winter period. Demand has stabilized at a floor; the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is 28.6 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival from P42 in P46. Current on-hand inventory is 70 units, and there are 98 units in-transit (orders from P43, P44, and P46). The pipeline inventory (168 units) is more than sufficient to cover the projected demand for the review period plus lead time (1+L = 5 periods), as 5 * 28.6 = 143 units. Although on-hand and in-transit cover the current needs, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to reflect the current winter stabilization and allow the OR backend to maintain optimal safety stock for the end-of-year/early-January transition.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor remains stable at end-of-year: Mean demand for P42-P46 is ~29 units, reflecting seasonal lows for lightweight basics. Pipeline and on-hand inventory are well-aligned with this regime.
