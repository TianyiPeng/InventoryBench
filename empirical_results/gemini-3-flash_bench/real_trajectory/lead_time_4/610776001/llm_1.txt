The product 'Tilly (1)' is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which typically has steady demand but may see slight increases approaching Spring/Summer. Historical demand data shows an average of ~157 units/week (range 105-212) over the last 5 weeks. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 1) will arrive in Period 5. This means I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (L+1 = 5 periods) to avoid stockouts. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory is 0. Based on the average demand of ~157, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 785 units. Including a safety stock buffer due to the variance seen in historical data (max 212), I will order 850 units to establish a solid pipeline.",

The date is mid-February, typically a stable period for basics before a potential spring uptick. Current average demand is approximately 165 units/week. Lead time is promised at 4 periods. Since I placed an order of 850 in Period 1, it is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and be usable for Period 6. This order (850) covers roughly 5 weeks of demand (850 / 165 \u2248 5.1). However, Period 1 demand (206) was higher than the historical average, and I am currently at 0 on-hand, meaning I am losing sales until that shipment arrives. To cover the pipeline for (L+1) = 5 periods (Periods 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), I need approximately 165 * 5 = 825 units plus safety stock. My current in-transit (850) technically covers 5 weeks of demand, but since I started with 0 inventory and am already experiencing stockouts (Period 1 sold 0 due to 0 on-hand), I need to ensure a continuous flow. Ordering an additional 200 units now will arrive in Period 6 to cover subsequent demand and build a small safety buffer against the recent high-demand signal (206-212 range).",

The game is in Period 44 of 47, with only 4 periods remaining. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 44) would arrive in Period 48, which is after the game concludes. Therefore, ordering any additional units would incur unnecessary holding costs without the opportunity to generate revenue. Current on-hand inventory is 236 units. Recent demand has averaged approximately 30 units per period (P38-P43 average: 31.5 units). Over the remaining 4 periods, total expected demand is roughly 120-130 units. The current on-hand stock of 236 units is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand until the game ends. I will place an order of 0 to maximize profit and minimize ending inventory holding costs.",

  "rationale": "The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt, which has followed a strong seasonal pattern: peaking in spring/summer (March\u2013June) and steadily declining through autumn. We are currently in mid-December (Period 45), with only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47). Demand has stabilized at a seasonal floor, averaging ~28 units over the last 7 weeks (P38-P44) and ~19 units in the most recent two weeks. With 217 units on hand and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 49, which is past the end of the simulation. Given the current inventory of 217 units and an expected demand of roughly 20-30 units per period, the current stock is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods (P45, P46, P47). Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs and provide no benefit to total reward.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt in lightweight jersey. Given the current date of December 23, 2019 (Period 46), we are in the middle of winter, which is the seasonal low for lightweight summer/spring basics. Demand has been consistently low, averaging ~29 units/period over the last 8 weeks (P38-P45). Recent individual demands were 20 (P43), 19 (P44), and 35 (P45). On-hand inventory is currently 182 units, which provides approximately 6 periods of coverage at the current demand rate (~30/week), far exceeding the lead time requirements (L=4). There are no units in-transit. Given the high holding cost relative to the seasonal demand floor and the approaching end of the game (P47 likely being the final period or close to it), ordering more stock would only incur unnecessary holding costs without any risk of stockouts. I will maintain an order of 0 to allow the existing inventory to deplete.",

Currently, on-hand inventory is 160 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the immediate future (approximately 5-6 weeks of stock at the current 'winter floor' rate of ~25-30 units/period). Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to the current low demand, and the fact that we are at the end of the year with plenty of stock on hand, no further orders are necessary to meet the service level or maximize profit.",
