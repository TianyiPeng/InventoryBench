Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch washed denim trouser. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a mean of 218.6 units (220, 197, 219, 212, 245) with a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no prior order history or observed lead time deviations, I will use the 'default' method for lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent stable demand regime before any potential spring seasonal shifts. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, balancing the high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 248 units based on the initial historical demand (avg ~218), but we started with 0 on-hand, resulting in 241 lost sales. The promised lead time is 4. The order placed in Period 1 (248 units) is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 (P1+4). Demand in the provided history (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a mean of 218.6 with a standard deviation of 19.3. Period 1 demand was 241, which is higher than the previous mean but consistent with the upward trend seen in the last historical sample (245 on Feb 4). Given the current stockout and high lost sales, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand to capture this recent higher level (N=5 covers the most recent samples including the Period 1 observation). I will stick to the 'default' lead time (promised L=4) as we have no evidence yet of arriving shipments to calculate actual lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' is stable with samples: 220, 197, 219, 212, 245 (historical) and 241, 258 (recent). The mean of the last 5 samples is approximately 235. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have not yet observed any arrivals (Scenario A in the instructions), we maintain the default lead time. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 504 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The goal is to cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. Using the recent 5 samples (N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) provides a focused forecast for the current regime.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' is a basic denim item. Historical demand (including samples) shows: 220, 197, 219, 212, 245 (samples) and 241, 258, 167 (observed). The drop to 167 in Period 3 might be a random fluctuation rather than a regime shift, as denim is typically non-seasonal. On-hand inventory is 0, and all units ordered since Period 1 are in-transit (Total 771 units). Promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the first order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in Periods 1-3 are expected and do not yet indicate a lead-time delay. I will maintain a lead time of 4. For demand, the average of all 8 available samples is approximately 220. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the most relevant mean while smoothing the recent dip.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a staple item (superstretch skinny denim). Looking at the history, current on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. The lead time is promised at 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and should be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Currently, we have 1039 units in-transit (P1: 248, P2: 256, P3: 267, P4: 268). Demand has fluctuated: the first five samples (initial data) averaged 218.6; the four game periods averaged 211.25. Recent demand in P3 (167) and P4 (179) is lower than the initial weeks. I will use recent_N (N=4) to weight the forecast toward these most recent observations while the lead time remains at the default of 4 periods. This maintains a lean pipeline while waiting for the first arrival to reach the warehouse.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 83 units, with 974 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Historical demand data and recent performance show a shift: initial demand (Jan/early Feb) averaged ~218 units, but the last three periods (Periods 3-5) have averaged 170.3 units. This suggests a potential post-peak drop or a stabilization at a lower level for this skinny denim product. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (profit/holding cost ratio suggests ~95% service level), I will use the last 3 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent lower demand regime, while keeping L at the default promised value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3201.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple apparel item (Divided collection). Current date is 2019/03/25. History shows a clear demand shift: Periods 1-2 averaged ~250 units, while Periods 3-6 dropped to an average of ~172 units. This suggests an initial launch peak or early spring surge followed by a lower steady-state demand regime. Promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data for Period 1 and 2 arrivals confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods (P1 ordered arrived P5, P2 ordered arrived P6). I will set L to 'default' as it matches observed reality. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current lower demand level (mean ~172) rather than the all-time average which is skewed by the initial high periods. Pipeline inventory (718) + On-hand (162) = 880 units, which covers about 5 periods of demand at the current rate (172 * 5 = 860).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 3: Average weekly demand decreased from ~250 to ~172 (-31%) and has remained stable for 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU '554450001' continues to exhibit a lower demand regime that began around Period 3. Historical demand for the first 4 periods (including pre-game samples) averaged ~220-250, but the last 5 periods (P3-P7) show a stable mean of approximately 170 (167, 179, 165, 177, 160). Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P5, P6, and P7 arrivals all matched a 4-period lag). On-hand inventory is 269 units, with 457 units in-transit (P4 order of 268 due next period, P5 order of 183 due in P9, etc.). Given the demand shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new demand distribution (mean ~170, low variance) ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on early high-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3563.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing SKU 554450001 (Julia RW Skinny Denim). Historical data shows a clear demand shift starting at Period 3. Prior to Period 3, demand averaged ~230; from Period 3 through Period 8, demand has averaged ~175.5 (167, 179, 165, 177, 160, 205). The most recent demand (P8) was 205, which is higher than the previous weeks but still lower than the initial regime. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this lower volume regime while respecting the slightly higher volatility seen in the last period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as promised (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). The current inventory position is healthy (332 on-hand + 341 in-transit = 673 total), which is sufficient to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current rate (~175 * 5 = 875), though we may need to scale up slightly if the P8 uptick persists. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods of the current regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-2 averaged ~250 units, while Period 3-9 averaged ~177 units. However, Period 9 saw a significant drop to 111 units, which could be noise or a further downward trend. The carry-over insight correctly identified the shift at Period 3. Leads times have consistently been 4 periods (as promised), with arrivals for orders from P1-P5 confirming this. Currently, on-hand (404) and in-transit (361) total 765 units, which is quite high relative to recent weekly demand (~177 * 5 = 885 coverage for L+1). Given the recent demand drop in P9 and the lower mean since P3, I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and capture recent volatility. I will keep L at 'calculate' as lead times are stable at 4.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' has significantly slowed down over the last two weeks (P9: 111, P10: 84) compared to the stable regime of ~172 seen from P3-P8. This decline aligns with the post-spring transition in fashion retail. Lead times are consistently 4 periods (P5-P9 arrivals confirmed this), and although no arrival was recorded in P10, this is normal as P6 had zero orders. The pipeline is healthy with 533 units in transit. To account for the recent demand drop and avoid excessive holding costs on a stabilizing or slowing product, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the lower 100-111 demand range, and L to 'calculate' based on the confirmed 4-period history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average weekly demand dropped from ~172 to ~100 (-42%) over the last two periods, coinciding with mid-late April seasonality.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we have observed a significant decline in demand for the skinny denim trousers. After an initial drop at Period 3 (from ~250 to ~172), demand has further decreased since Period 9 (averaging 94.7 over the last 3 periods), likely due to a shift towards warmer weather styles in late spring. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods, although the Period 6 order (0 units) is implicitly 'arrived' or skipped, and Period 7 arrived on schedule. We are currently overstocked with 237 units on-hand and 575 in-transit. To avoid excessive holding costs on a declining product, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent demand regime (~95 units/period) for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). L is set to calculate as lead times remain consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: Avg weekly demand has stabilized at ~95 (down from ~172) for 3 consecutive periods (P9-P11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Carry-over insights confirm a demand regime shift at Period 9, where average demand dropped from ~172 to ~95. Recent demand (P9-P12) has been 111, 84, 89, and 126, which benchmarks to a mean of 102.5. The 'In-transit' quantity (423 units) includes a significant order of 203 units from Period 9 that should arrive in the current Period 13 resolution phase (lead time 4). On-hand inventory is 263. Combined, the pipeline is quite high relative to the new demand levels. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand phase (102.5 * 5 = 512.5). I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to reflect the recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at its promised value of 4 based on history.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Historical analysis confirms a significant demand drop since mid-April (Period 9), with the average weekly demand stabilizing at approximately 102 units over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), down from 172. The product is skinny denim, which is likely seeing lower demand as warmer spring/summer weather arrives. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods (P1: L=4, P2: L=4, P3: L=4, P4: L=4, P5: L=4, P7: L=4, P8: L=4, P9: L=4). Current on-hand inventory (358) and in-transit units (220) total 578 units, which covers approximately 5.6 periods of the current demand regime (102 units/week). Since L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. The current pipeline is sufficient to cover this. To prevent overstocking during this low-demand phase, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current 102 units/week rate, and sigma_hat with recent_N to reflect the lower volatility of this new regime. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand shows a confirmed regime shift at Period 9 (early April), where average demand dropped to approximately 95 units, followed by a recent slight uptick in Period 14 (152 units). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim', which typically follows seasonal trends. Demand has averaged ~115 units over the last 6 periods (P9-P14). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (all recent arrivals had L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (378 units) and in-transit is low (51 units). With a total pipeline of 429 units and an average demand estimate of ~115, we have roughly 3.7 weeks of stock, which is slightly below the (L+1)=5 week coverage target. However, given the high holding cost and the recent lower demand levels compared to early Feb/Mar, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-April shift while accounting for the recent volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' has been in a lower regime since Period 9 (late April), with demand in the last 7 periods (P9-P15) averaging 112 units per week. The most recent demand (P14: 152, P15: 114) suggests a slight uptick or stabilization around this lower mean compared to earlier in the year. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate according to the arrival history (the P11 order arrived on P15, exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is currently high (312 units), and there are 156 units in transit (likely the P14 order of 114 units and the P15 order of 153 units, noting that P12 and P13 had 0 orders). Given the high on-hand and pipeline inventory relative to the current demand regime (~112 units/week), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this established lower demand stage (starting Period 9). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to reflect the recent volatility. This approach prevents over-ordering while maintaining a safety stock appropriate for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: Avg weekly demand has stabilized at ~112 (down from earlier peaks) for 7 consecutive periods (P9-P15).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is skinny denim trousers. Carry-over insights and recent history (P9-P16) confirm a stable low-demand regime following an April drop. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P9-P16) is approximately 111 units per week. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods (as seen in the most recent arrivals from P7 through P11). Period 16 conclude shows reached inventory of 208 with demand of 104. There is a significant amount in transit (306 units), which includes orders from P14 (3 units), P15 (153 units), and P16 (150 units). Given the target base stock is approximately (L+1) * mean_demand = 5 * 111 = 555, and current pipeline (on-hand 208 + in-transit 306 = 514) is close to that target, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current stable regime for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This allows the backend to adjust the order downward if needed while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the current demand level.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of super-skinny denim trousers. Historical data shows two distinct demand drops: first at Period 3 (avg ~172) and a second at Period 9 (avg ~112). Current demand from Period 10 to Period 17 continues to fluctuate around a lower mean, specifically averaging 106 units over the last 8 periods. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods (except for the zero-order at P6 and P12/P13 clearing previously placed orders). Period 10's order (172 units) is notably absent\u2014it should have arrived at the start of Period 15, but looking at 'Period 14 conclude', we see the P10 order actually arrived in Period 14 (concluded at P14, read at P15). However, Period 16 and 17 had 0 arrivals despite orders from P12 and P13 being zero. This is expected. Pipeline inventory is currently high (426 units) relative to recent demand, which explains high ending inventories. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the stabilized demand regime started in Period 9 and maintain the default lead time of 4.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 554450001 (super-skinny denim) shows a clear downward trend likely due to the summer seasonality; demand in the last 3 periods (P16-P18) has averaged approximately 79 units, compared to the previous regime average of ~112. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P14 order arriving exactly in P18). There is a significant discrepancy regarding missing shipments: the order from Period 12 (0 units) and Period 13 (0 units) were placeholders, but the order from Period 15 (153 units) and Period 16 (150 units) are currently in-transit and expected soon. Current on-hand is low (77), but total pipeline inventory (487) is very high relative to the dropping demand. To prevent excessive holding costs during this low-demand summer phase, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the ~79 units/week average (totaling ~395 for L+1). This will trigger the OR engine to order less or nothing as the pipeline is sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Avg weekly demand decreased from ~112 to ~79 (-29%) as summer seasonality takes full effect for skinny denim.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are managing 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch denim product. As identified in the carry-over insights, the demand has entered a summer low-season. Since Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 87.5 units per week (P16: 104, P17: 77, P18: 57, P19: 112). The most recent period (P19) saw a slight rebound to 112, but the overall trend since late May is significantly lower than the spring average. Pipeline reconcile: Order from P16 (150 units) is expected to arrive this period (P20), followed by P17 (120 units) in P21, P18 (64 units) in P22, and P19 (0 units) in P23. Total on-hand (118) plus in-transit (334) equals 452 units, which is ample against the current lead-time demand (5 periods * ~88 units = 440). To prevent overstocking during this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to reflect the summer average (~88 units/week x 5 = 440) and calculating volatility based on those same periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/07/01), the product (Julia RW Skinny Denim) is in a low-demand summer season. Recent demand has stabilized around a lower mean. Specifically, in the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has been 104, 77, 57, 112, 61, averaging roughly 82 units per week. The Carry-over Insight from Period 19 noted a shift starting at P16 (~79 units). The current pipeline is fairly high (263 in-transit, 207 on-hand), and lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods. Given the high service level requirements (Profit $19/Holding $1), the target stock should safely cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower summer demand regime, which helps prevent overstocking and high holding costs as we progress through July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is 'super-skinny denim', which exhibits lower demand during the peak summer weeks compared to spring. Since Period 19, a new demand regime has been observed with demand levels fluctuating around an average of ~84 units (Period 19: 112, Period 20: 61, Period 21: 105). This is a significant drop from the previous regime (~112 units). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 18-21). With 222 units on-hand and 176 units in-transit (Total = 398), and a lead time of 4 periods, we are currently covered for nearly 5 periods of demand at the current average (398 / 84 \u2248 4.7 periods). I will set the demand parameters using the last 3 periods to capture this most recent summer slowdown, ensuring the OR backend correctly sizes orders to avoid further overstocking as we remain in the low-demand trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: Summer low for skinny denim stabilized at an average of ~84 units (Periods 19-21) compared to the previous ~112 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is skinny denim, which has shown a sustained demand decrease as summer intensified. Carry-over insights confirm a demand regime shift at Period 19, with demand stabilizing at a lower average of ~84 units (Period 19-22 demand: 112, 61, 105, 105). Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 18-22). Inventory health is currently high with 181 units on-hand and 251 units in-transit. Since we are in the summer low, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower average of ~95 units/week across the L+1 period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent volatility. This conservative approach helps manage holding costs while maintaining enough stock for the lower seasonal demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/22. The demand for Julia RW Skinny Denim has shown a sustained lower level during the summer period, as noted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand samples (P19-P23: 112, 61, 105, 105, 114) exhibit an average of approximately 99.4 units per period. While earlier insights suggested a drop to ~84, the most recent five periods indicate a slight recovery or stabilization near 100 units. I will use N=5 for the demand forecast to capture this recent stabilization. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (P18 order arrived P22). On-hand inventory is relatively low (67), but there is a significant pipeline in-transit (384), including orders from P20 and P21 that should arrive in P24 and P25 respectively. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat targets a base stock level that covers this stabilized summer demand across the L+1 window without over-ordering into the high-holding-cost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~100 units/period (P19-P23) following the late-June summer low, representing a slight increase from the previous 'summer low' estimate of 84.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for Julia RW Skinny Denim has stabilized after the initial summer low (late June). Over the last 6 periods (P19-P24), demand averages ~96.5 units/period (112, 61, 105, 105, 114, 82). Although the carry-over insight mentions ~100 units, the recent trend reflects minor fluctuations around this mean. Shipping lead times remain consistent at 4 periods (P20 order arrived P24). We have 64 units on-hand and 432 units in-transit. The in-transit pipeline accounts for orders from P21 (33), P22 (139), P23 (133), and P24 (127), totaling 432. The order from P21 (33 units) is expected to arrive in Period 25. To capture the current market regime, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the average of ~97 units/period across the lead time + review period (L+1=5), and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture recent volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Historically, demand for skinny denim has stabilized at approximately 100 units/period (P19-P25 mean \u2248 95). We are entering the 'Back to School' season, which typically triggers a demand recovery for denim trousers. Recent demand (P23-P25) has been consistent around 82-114 units. An order from Period 22 (139 units) is expected to arrive this period (P26), which will alleviate the low on-hand inventory of 10. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To set OR parameters, I will use a recent window (N=7, since P19) to reflect the current post-summer-low regime, as we anticipate a transition from the summer trough toward autumn levels.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school season (August) starting; demand expected to transition from 100-unit summer plateau to higher autumn levels.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12, marking the beginning of the Back-to-School season for denim. Demand has stabilized around 100 units/period (avg of P23-P26 is 97.5) after the summer low. Historically, August and September see rising demand for trousers/jeans as customers prepare for autumn. I will project a slight increase to 110 units per period to account for this seasonal transition. For the OR backend, mu_hat represents the demand over (L+1) periods. With L=4 (promised), L+1 = 5 periods. 110 * 5 = 550. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P22, P24, P25, P26 all showed L=4). Sigma_hat is set using a recent window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school season (August) demand starting to rise; initial post-summer plateau observed at ~100 units/period (P23-P26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3225.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' is clearly entering the 'Back-to-School' seasonal ramp-up. In Period 27, demand jumped to 170 units from a summer plateau of ~100. This aligns with mid-August seasonality for trousers/denim. On-hand inventory is low (5 units), while 398 units are in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have entered a new demand regime (August spike), I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the upward momentum (P25: 87, P26: 107, P27: 170). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to capture the increased volatility associated with the seasonal transition, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock (z* buffer) to handle potential further spikes as we approach September.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed: Period 27 demand rose to 170 units, a 60-70% increase over the summer average (~100 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2508.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450001' (Julia RW Skinny Denim) has entered the Back-to-School season (late August). Significant demand growth is confirmed: Period 27 demand was 170 units and Period 28 demand was 167 units, compared to the summer plateau of ~100 units. Unfortunately, Period 28 resulted in a stockout (sold 132 of 167 requested) with 0 ending inventory. This indicates the current base stock levels are insufficient for the seasonal surge. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. To prevent prolonged stockouts during this high-demand autumn phase, I am shifting mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to the 'recent_N' method where N=3. This focuses on the most recent two periods of growth plus the breakout period, ensuring the OR backend targets the higher mean (~168 per period) rather than the long-term summer average. The 'cap' logic in the OR backend should help modulate the order, but providing a higher mu_hat is necessary to increase the target inventory position and cover the (L+1) exposure window.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed (late August): Weekly demand has risen from ~100 units to ~168 units (+68%) over Periods 27-28.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1197.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Julia RW Skinny Denim is currently in a high-demand regime driven by the Back-to-School season (August/September). Demand in Period 27 and 28 was ~168 units, and although Period 29's demand was recorded as 113, this was a stock-out constrained figure (sold 63, demand was 113+; however, looking at the previous weeks 170 and 167, the latent demand is likely still around 170). The SKU has experienced stock-outs for two consecutive periods (Ending Inventory = 0). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 608 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To recover from the stock-out and maintain service levels during this high-demand period, I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the surge (Periods 27-29), which reflects a mean of ~150 (including the stock-out constrained P29). To be safe and capture the true latent demand spike of ~170, I will use an N of 3 to stay reactive. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime remains active into September; latent demand is estimated at ~170 units/period based on P27-P28, though P29 observed demand was capped by stock-out.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the back-to-school/autumn demand surge (September). Recent demand samples (P27-P30) show a sustained increase to approximately 170 units per period. However, the last three periods (P28-P30) resulted in stock-outs (ending inventory 0), meaning observed demand (167, 113, 170) was constrained by supply. The true latent demand is at least 170 units, potentially higher given the stock-out in P29. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to reflect this 170 units/period forecast across the lead time + review period (5 periods total: 5 * 170 = 850). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand is currently 0 with 736 units in-transit (orders from P27-P30). The OR engine needs to cover the demand for the next 5 periods while accounting for the high service level (profit/cost ratio is very high at 19:1).

Carry-over insight: Significant stock-out regime (Periods 28-30): Observed demand capped by zero inventory. Latent demand confirmed at ~170+ units based on Period 27/30.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-September back-to-school peak for skinny denim. Historical demand evidence from Periods 27, 30, and 31 suggests latent weekly demand is approximately 170-185 units, while Periods 28-31 have seen stock-outs. Specifically, Period 31 demand was 185 despite the stock-out. The goal is to provide enough inventory for a 5-period window (L+1). With an estimated latent mu of ~175 and high volatility during seasonal shifts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime which is significantly higher than the long-term average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (Periods 27-31). Pipeline inventory is high (820 units) due to recent large orders, which the OR backend will subtract from the target base stock. Setting mu_hat to 875 (175 * 5) and sigma_hat to 120 ensures we remain responsive to the high autumn demand while accounting for recent stock-out capped observations.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime (September): Latent demand confirmed at ~175-185 units/period based on Period 31 (185 units) and previous unconstrained observations, despite ongoing inventory shortages.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' is currently in a high-demand September/Back-to-school phase. Recent unconstrained and partially constrained demand (Periods 27, 31, 32) indicates a stable latent demand regime of approximately 175-185 units per period. Period 32 demand was 175 units, and Period 31 was 185 units. I am setting mu_hat based on an explicit forecast of 180 units per period for the review + lead time window (L+1 = 5 periods), totaling 900. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P23-P28. On-hand inventory is very low (18 units) due to recent stock-outs, but a large pipeline (880 units) is in transit, with 207 units expected to arrive in Period 33 (ordered P29) and 203 in Period 34 (ordered P30). The explicit mu_hat of 900 and a slightly elevated sigma_hat to account for recent volatility will allow the OR backend to maintain the high service level needed for this peak season while the pipeline refills on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/September demand regime for skinny denim confirmed stable at ~180 units/period (based on P31-P32).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, observed demand was 337 units, which is a massive outlier compared to the previous 'stable' back-to-school regime of ~180 units. This likely represents a month-end or seasonal peak for skinny denim at the end of September. Given on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 769 units in-transit (P30-P33 orders), we must account for this volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the 337 demand might be a one-time peak or the start of an even higher regime, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the shift from the summer low to the current autumn volatility (Periods 27-33). This balances the ~175 avg with the recent 337 spike. mu_hat will be set to (1+L)*mean of last 7 samples to ensure the pipeline covers this heightened demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand volatility spike detected in Period 33 (337 units), significantly exceeding the previously confirmed back-to-school regime of ~180. Demand is no longer stable and shows high late-September variance.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early October (Period 35). Recent demand history reveals a significant shift: after a relative plateau of ~170-185 units during the August/September back-to-school season, demand spiked to 337 in Period 33 and remained high at 210 in Period 34 (which was also stock-constrained). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P31-P34) is 226.75, but P33/P34 suggest a new, more volatile regime possibly linked to autumn fashion peaks or promotional events. Inventory is currently critical (on-hand 0). Pipeline inventory is 869 units, but demand is consistently outstripping arrivals. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stock-outs in this high-demand, high-volatility phase, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods to capture the recent jump, and setting an explicit sigma_hat of 150 to account for the massive variance observed in P33 (337 vs mean ~200). This higher sigma will force the OR backend to increase the safety stock (base stock) to handle potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: High-volatility autumn peak detected. Average demand increased from ~180 to ~225+ with a significant variance spike (P33 demand was 337).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October, a period where denim demand is traditionally high during the autumn season. A demand regime shift was detected in Period 33, characterized by a significant move from a stable ~180 units/period to a higher-volatility peak averaging ~225-250 units (captured in the 337 spike in P33 and ~205-210 in P34-P35). Lead times have remained exceptionally stable at the promised 4 periods. The goal is to cover $(L+1) = 5$ periods of demand to prevent the stock-outs seen in recent weeks. Given the high variance since Period 33, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to focus on this autumn peak regime, and an explicit sigma_hat of 60 to buffer against the observed high volatility (P33 demand was 1.5x the current mean). L remains at default since it is perfectly reliable.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volatility regime confirmed (P33-P35): Average demand shifted to ~250 units with significantly higher variance compared to the back-to-school period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The focus is Period 37 (October 21, 2019). We occupy an autumn high-demand regime for skinny denim. While Period 33 saw a massive outlier of 337, subsequent unconstrained demand periods (P35: 203, P36: 125) suggest the high-volatility regime is erratic but generally averages higher than the back-to-school period. Specifically, the mean of the most recent four unconstrained or partially constrained periods (P31, P32, P34, P35, P36) shows a mean around 210-220 units, but with significant variance. Period 36's drop to 125 units might be a temporary lull or a shift, but given the 'Autumn high-volatility regime' note, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current mean which balances the P33 surge with the P36 dip. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My parameter choices aim to maintain high service levels (q ~ 0.95) to avoid the stock-outs seen in September, while acknowledging the recent uptick in on-hand inventory (142).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 554450001 (superstretch skinny denim) is currently in an autumn high-volatility regime. While demand spiked to 337 in Period 33, it has since settled at 210, 203, 125, and 165 in Periods 34-37. This suggests the autumn peak is stabilizing but remains highly variable compared to the summer. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 73 units on-hand and 1179 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the stock-out phase), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P33-P37) to capture this higher mean and variance while letting the OR backend account for the substantial pipeline. The mean demand of the last 5 periods (including the 337 spike) is approximately 208 units per week, which is appropriate for the current season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volatility regime (P33-P37) shows an average latent demand of approximately 210 units/period, significantly higher than the back-to-school plateau. Inventory levels are recovering from a prolonged stock-out.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the autumn high-volatility regime for skinny denim. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (P33-P38) has been [337*, 210*, 203, 125, 165, 225], where '*' denotes stock-out constrained periods. Excluding the P33 outlier and considering the recovery from stock-outs, the underlying demand mean is approximately 180-210 units. Recent periods (P37-P38) show demand returning to the 165-225 range. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this autumn regime's mean and higher variance (\u03c3 \u2248 45-50). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 151, with a large pipeline of 958 units (orders from P35-P38), which means the OR controller will likely order smaller amounts now to avoid overstocking as we approach the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volatility regime (P33-P38) latent demand mean is approximately 185 units/period, with significantly higher variance compared to summer/back-to-school plateaus.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in an autumn high-volatility regime for skinny denim. Historical data from P33-P39 shows a latent demand mean of approximately 185 units, but with significant variance (observed demand ranging from 125 to 337). Recent periods (P36-P39) show demand figures of 125, 165, 225, and 128. The pipeline is currently healthy with 829 units in-transit and 361 on-hand, which should mitigate the risk of stock-outs seen in September/October. Given the high variance and the transition toward the late-year holidays, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the mean and variance of this specific autumn regime (P33-P39). This provides a balanced forecast that accounts for the periodic spikes (like the 337 in P33) while acknowledging the more moderate recent weeks.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the post-autumn peak transition toward late Q4. After the high volatility observed in September/October (P33-P38), demand in the last two periods has softened slightly to 128 and 154 units. The Carry-over Insights for P39 noted a mean latent demand of ~185 units for the autumn regime. Given the recent drop, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the autumn regime (P33-P40) average, which reflects both the 337-unit spike and the more recent 120-150 unit stabilization. This covers the (L+1) period demand window. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to account for the heightened variance seen in this specific regime. Lead time (L) remains solid at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history. On-hand (556) and in-transit (552) are high, so the OR backend will likely order minimally or nothing this period to optimize holding costs while maintaining a buffer for the 95% service level requirement.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak stabilization: Average demand for Period 33-40 is ~188 units, with recent periods (P39-P40) showing a moderating trend toward ~140 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are moving past the autumn peaks into a more stable late-November/early-December period. Recent demand (P39-P41) has averaged ~137 units (128, 154, 130), showing a significant cooling from the high-volatility autumn regime (which averaged ~185-210 units). Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 615), which is sufficient to cover over 4 periods of the current demand profile. However, internal calculations for the base stock need to reflect this lower, more stable demand to avoid excessive overstocking as we approach the end of the year. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new lower stabilization point (~137 units/period). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 37's shipment in Period 41.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization post-autumn peak: From P39-P41, average weekly demand has decreased from ~185 down to ~137 units (-26%) and shows reduced volatility.

=== Period 42 Summary ===
554450001: ordered=0, arrived=82 units (ordered on Period 38, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=697, demand=499, sold=499, ending on-hand inventory=198

Daily Reward (R_t): $9283.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike to 499 units, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (late November). This significantly disrupts the previous post-autumn stabilization trend (~137 units). With only 198 units on-hand and 394 in-transit, we are at risk if December holiday demand remains elevated. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high demand of 499 and the upcoming December holiday season, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the jump in average demand (228 units/period) and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (166 units/period). This aggressive stance ensures the OR backend raises the base stock for the (L+1) window to handle potential December surges.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected at Period 42: Demand spiked to 499 units (likely Black Friday), significantly exceeding the recent mean of ~137.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1473.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday period (Dec 9). Period 42 saw a massive spike to 499 units (Black Friday), followed by a cooling to 94 units in Period 43. Based on the product description (skinny superstretch jeans) and historical patterns (P42 surge), we are currently in the holiday/December regime. While demand dropped immediately after the peak, Christmas shopping typically sustains higher-than-average volume through late December. The on-hand inventory is 313, with 711 in-transit (reflecting the large order from P43). Given the lead time of 4, orders placed now arrive in P48 (the end of the simulation). Therefore, this is the final ordering opportunity to impact the remaining 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5, covering P39-P43) which includes both the pre-peak, the peak, and the immediate post-peak demand to capture the higher mean (~181/week) expected for the holiday season compared to the autumn plateau. sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the massive variance introduced by the 499-unit spike, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer for potential pre-Christmas surges.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: Period 42 demand spiked to 499 (Black Friday), followed by Period 43 demand of 94. Sustained December demand mean is estimated at ~180 units/period based on recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2035.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16th, placing us in the mid-December holiday shopping period. Last period (P44) saw demand of 121, following a post-Black Friday dip (P43: 94). Historically, following the Black Friday spike (P42: 499), December demand for this product category (skinny denim) tends to stay elevated but below peak levels until the final pre-Christmas rush. The average demand across the holiday regime (P42-P44) is approximately 238, though heavily skewed by the outlier. Excluding the outlier, the mean is ~107. However, latent demand during high-traffic weeks is likely higher. With on-hand inventory at 264 and a large pipeline of 917 units (including a 526-unit order from P43), we are well-positioned. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1) window using an explicit forecast of 180 units/week to account for the remaining late-December demand and potential post-holiday returns/sales, while using recent_N for sigma to capture the high volatility introduced by the Black Friday spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (December) mean estimated at ~180 units/period (latent) to account for high traffic volatility, despite lower non-peak observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2143.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late December holiday period (Dec 23). Historical demand reflects a massive spike on Nov 25 (Period 42, demand 499) likely representing Black Friday, followed by a lower average in the mid-100s. The 'carry_over_insight' suggests a holiday regime mean of ~180 to account for potential traffic spikes around Christmas and post-holiday sales, although the last three periods (P43-P45) have averaged 114 units. Given we are at the end of the year (Period 46 of 47), the goal is to manage the final inventory levels while ensuring availability for the very last period. On-hand inventory is 251 with 1144 in-transit. Since lead time is 4, an order placed today will arrive in Period 50, which is beyond the game end (Period 47). Therefore, we focus on setting parameters that reflect the current late-seasonal demand and ensure any calculated stocks are based on high-volatility holiday data. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the post-Black Friday behavior (P42-P45) which averages 210 units (including the spike) or 114 (excluding it). I'll choose N=4 to include the spike for safety, resulting in a mean of ~210/week.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season peak (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) confirmed at P42. Post-peak demand (P43-P45) stabilized at ~114 units, but inventory risk remains high due to late-December shopping volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30), the post-Christmas and pre-New Year period. Historical data shows that while a massive spike occurred during Black Friday (P42, demand=499), recent weeks (P43-P46) have stabilized with a mean around 110 units (94, 121, 126, 98). The 'Holiday demand regime' is tapering off, but January often sees clearance sales or seasonal turnover for denim. Inventory is currently healthy with 153 on-hand and significant pipeline (526 from P43, 278 from P44, 340 from P45, 366 from P46). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak normalization while acknowledging the residual holiday volatility. This setting (N=5 covers the holiday peak spike and the subsequent drop) ensures we don't over-react to the recent low demand while the pipeline is full.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization: Demand has stabilized at ~110 units/period (P43-P46) following the Black Friday peak, though high pipeline inventory reflects previous aggressive holiday ordering.
