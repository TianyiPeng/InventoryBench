Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Gwen Jersey Top'. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historically, demand has been increasing: 18, 31, 46, 46, 34 (average ~35). The product is a 'Vest top' and 'Womens Premium', which typically sees growing demand as spring approaches (February). Since it's the first decision period, no 'conclude' messages exist to verify actual lead time; I will use the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent demand levels (average ~42) rather than the lower start. The OR backend will compute the base stock using these parameters to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (Vest top/Womens Premium). Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a rising trend: 18, 31, 46, 46, 34. In Period 1 (Feb 11), demand was 46. The mean of all 6 samples is 36.8. However, looking at the recent 3 weeks (Jan 21, Jan 28, Feb 11), demand is consistently higher (avg ~46). In Period 1, we ordered 54 units, but because the promised lead time is 4, they are correctly 'In-transit' and not yet arrived. On-hand is 0, so we lost 46 units of sales in Period 1. To recover and build a buffer, I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture the higher baseline of ~45-46 units/week. L is kept at default (4). mu_hat calculation: (1+L) * mean_demand = 5 * 46 = 230.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). This is a 'Gwen Jersey Top', a women's premium vest top. Historical demand shows a rising trend (18, 31, 46, 46, 34) and recent demand in Periods 1 and 2 has been consistently 46. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because we started with 0 and orders have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the order from Period 1 was placed with L=4, it is scheduled to arrive during Period 5 (visible at start of Period 6). We have 108 units in transit (54 from P1, 54 from P2). I will base demand (mu_hat) on the last 5 samples, which includes the recent spike to 46, to ensure we cover the current regime. Sigma_hat is calculated similarly to account for recent volatility. L is kept at the default promised lead time of 4 until we see evidence of drift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top', a women's premium fitted top. Current period is March 4th. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show a mean of ~35 units. However, recent demand (Periods 1-3) has been slightly higher, averaging 43.3 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, I expect it to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). In-transit inventory is 161 (54 from P1, 54 from P2, 53 from P3), which is consistent. Because we are currently out of stock and losing sales, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the slightly higher recent demand average (43.3) compared to the long-term history (35), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (Vest top/Womens Premium), which is a light, spaghetti-strap garment likely to see increased demand as spring approaches (March/April). Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 34.2 units/week, but the last 5 weeks (including the first 4 game periods) show a slightly higher average of 41.4 units/week (18, 31, 46, 46, 34 + game periods 46, 46, 38, 43). Current date is 2019/3/11. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are at Period 5, the first order placed in Period 1 (with L=4) is scheduled to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5. We have not seen its 'conclude' message yet because Step 4 of Period 5 has not occurred. Currently, on-hand is 0 and pipeline is 222 units. I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand (N=5 approx 41.4) to account for the slight upward trend as we move into the spring season.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' which is entering the spring season. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 18, 31, 46, 46, 34. Game history demand (Periods 1-5) are: 46, 46, 38, 43, 31. The mean demand across all 10 available samples is 37.9. Current on-hand is 23, and we have 168 units in-transit. The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Since L=4, my parameters must cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use the mean of all history (approx 38) for mu_hat Calculation: (4+1) * 38 = 190. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of all samples is approximately 9.3, so (sqrt(5) * 9.3) \u2248 20.8. I'll use the 'default' method for L to stick with promised lead time, 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all 10 data points which show relatively stable demand around the 35-45 range.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (Womens Premium). The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: orders from P1 and P2 arrived in P5 and P6 respectively (lead_time = 4). Current inventory: 34 on-hand, 131 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P6). Demand history: [18, 31, 46, 46, 34, 46, 46, 38, 43, 31, 43]. The demand is relatively stable but shows slight fluctuations. Mean of all samples is ~38.45. Using N=5 (most recent periods) captures the current Spring demand profile (31-46 range). Since Profit ($4) relative to Holding Cost ($1) suggests a service level of ~80%, maintaining a consistent base stock via recent_N is appropriate. Observed lead time matches promised, so L will use 'calculate' to incorporate the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (spaghetti strap vest top), which is a spring/summer seasonal item. Historical demand and recent observations show a stable pattern: recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 39.4 units per week, compared to the pre-game history average of 34.2. With spring progressing, demand is expected to remain firm or slightly increase. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). We have 45 units on-hand and 126 in-transit (orders from P4, P6, P7). To maintain service levels given the 4-period lead time, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N for both demand and sigma (N=5) captures the current consumption rate while adjusting for the slightly higher recent volatility compared to the initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $234.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (Womens Premium Vest Top), which is seasonally relevant for spring/summer. Historical demand across 13 samples (5 pre-game + 8 in-game) shows a mean of approximately 42.4 units. However, demand in Period 8 spiked to 68, which is significantly higher (approx. +60% vs. average). This could be due to the onset of spring weather or pre-Easter shopping. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by P4 order arriving in P8). Given the lead time L=4, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent demand increase more heavily, while using the default L (promised 4) as it aligns with observed history. The in-transit pipeline (101 units) plus current on-hand (38) equals 139 units; using recent_N=5 (avg ~46.4) would target a base stock around 230+ units, necessitating further ordering to prevent stockouts during this potential seasonal upturn.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 8 (68 units), coinciding with early April spring seasonality.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019. The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (spaghetti strap vest top), which is highly seasonal for Spring/Summer. We observed a significant demand spike in Period 8 (68 units) coinciding with the start of April, followed by a lower demand of 30 in Period 9. The low demand in P9 is likely due to volatility or a short-term correction, but the overall trend for a vest top in mid-April should be upward. Lead time is stable at 4 periods as previously confirmed. No order arrived in Period 9 because no order was placed in Period 5. On-hand inventory is very low (8 units). Pipeline inventory (169 units) consists of orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent higher demand (avg ~46.2) compared to the early season baseline. I will use 'default' for L (4 periods) and sigma_hat to maintain standard buffer.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22. The item is a 'Gwen Jersey Top', a sleeveless vest top, which is highly seasonal for spring/summer. Historical demand shows a significant spike in early April (period 8, demand=68) and remains elevated (period 10, demand=52) compared to early periods (averaging ~42). The Period 10 stockout (sold 25 vs demand 52) occurred because the order from Period 5 (0 units) left a gap in the pipeline. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (Period 6 order arrived Period 10). I need to account for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the seasonal nature and recent demand levels, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher spring baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the confirmed lead time L=4. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the upward demand trend as we move into warmer months.

Carry-over insight: Post-winter demand regime established: average demand increased from ~42 to ~50 units starting Period 8, coinciding with spring seasonality for sleeveless tops.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we are deep into the spring season for the 'Gwen Jersey Top', a sleeveless vest top. Historical demand shows a clear regime shift starting Period 8 (April 1st), with demand averaging 53.5 units (68, 30, 52, 64) compared to the pre-April average of 41.5. Despite high demand, the on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stockouts in Periods 10 and 11. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P7). Note: The order from Period 5 was 0 units, explaining why we saw no arrival in Period 9 and a subsequent stockout. The in-transit pipeline (214 units) includes orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 periods. For demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the elevated spring regime of ~53 units per period. This results in a mu_hat of 265 units (5 periods * 53) to ensure the system targets enough stock to cover the lead time plus the current period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The SKU is a 'Vest top/spaghetti strap' top, which is entering peak seasonality for spring/summer. Historical demand confirms a regime shift starting Period 8 (April); the average demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 52.4 units, compared to ~41 previously. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for three consecutive periods), indicating that previous stocking levels were insufficient for this higher demand regime. An order placed in Period 5 (54 units) is now overdue (it should have arrived in Period 9 if lead time were 4). Given that subsequent orders from Periods 6, 7, and 8 have arrived as expected with a 4-period lead time, the Period 5 order is likely lost. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for delivered shipments. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the 52.4 average demand of the current spring regime, providing a forecast for the (L+1)=5 period window. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Period 5 order (54 units) confirmed lost; subsequent orders (P6, P7, P8) arrived on time with 4-period lead time. Demand remains in high-regime (avg ~52) as summer approaches.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (vest top/spaghetti strap), which is entering its peak summer season. Historical demand shows a regime shift starting around Period 8 (late March/early April), with demand frequently exceeding 50 units (avg ~52.5 over the last 6 periods). Period 13 saw a slight dip (41 units), but seasonality suggests this is a temporary fluctuation. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P9 arrived in P13). There is a confirmed lost shipment from Period 5, which caused stockouts in Periods 10-12. Current on-hand is 27, with 223 units in transit (P10-P13 orders). To maintain high service levels for the summer peak and account for the pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the higher spring/summer demand regime, and L to 'calculate' given the consistent 4-period lead time history.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top', a sleeveless vest top, which is entering its peak summer season in the Northern Hemisphere. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 8 (early April). The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P8-P14) is approx 51.1 units (68, 30, 52, 64, 48, 41, 55). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (except for the lost P5 order). The current on-hand inventory is 31, with 194 units in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, P14). Since demand is moving into peak summer, I will use recent history (N=7) to capture this higher mean and volatility. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate as recent arrivals confirm the promised lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the 'Gwen Jersey Top' is entering peak summer demand. Historical data indicates a demand regime shift at Period 8 (early April), with average demand increasing from ~42 to ~51 units. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has stabilized around 51, 55, and 57 units (avg ~54). The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The Period 5 order remains lost, but subsequent logistics are stable. The on-hand inventory is 25 units, with 199 units in-transit (orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15). I am using recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture the high-regime demand established since Period 8 (P8 to P15 = 8 samples) and explicit sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen during this period (std dev ~11.5). This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock levels sufficient to cover the summer peak while accounting for the confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand confirmed: Period 13-15 demand avg 51 units/period, consistent with spring/summer seasonality for vest tops.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. The product is a 'Womens Premium Vest Top', which is in peak summer demand. Period 16 showed a significant demand surge to 101 units, following a stable regime of ~51 units/period since Period 13. This spike suggests either a random outlier or the start of a high-summer peak. Given the on-hand inventory of only 6 units and a 4-period lead time, there is a high stockout risk. The pipeline (in-transit) is 175 units (comprising orders from P13: 31, P14: 30, P15: 56, P16: 58). The P13 order (31 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P17. To account for the recent demand increase and the seasonal nature of the product, I will shift the \u03bc\u0302 forecast to focus on the last 4 periods (P13-P16), where the average demand is (41+55+57+101)/4 = 63.5 units/period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/spike at Period 16: demand hit 101 units, raising the 4-period moving average to ~64 units as summer peak reaches its height.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (a jersey vest top) has entered its peak summer demand regime, as evidenced by a sustained surge over the last 10 periods. The most recent demand (P16: 101, P17: 103) is significantly higher than the previous spring average (~50). This shift aligns with the June 10th date, representing the height of summer seasonality. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) with a high stockout recorded in P17 (37 sold out of 103 demand). I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods (N=2) to capture this recent spike (average ~102) rather than dilute it with earlier, lower spring data. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. The goal is to maximize the base stock to recover from the current deficit and meet peak-season requirements.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime confirmed: Demand spiked to >100 units/period starting Period 16 (P16: 101, P17: 103), up from the previous regime of ~55.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (vest top), currently in the peak summer season (June 17). Demand has surged significantly starting in Period 16, with the last three periods recording 101, 103, and 88 units respectively (average ~97 units). This is a clear regime shift from the previous average of ~55. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stockouts in Periods 17 and 18, and we are heavily reliant on the pipeline (326 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P17 and P18). To capture the new summer peak demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3). This reflects a per-period mean of ~97.3, which when multiplied by (1+L=5) results in a total mu_hat of ~486. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this high-demand period. These parameters will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that prioritizes high service levels to minimize lost sales during the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16 (June): Summer peak demand for vest tops has increased from ~55 to ~97 units/period (+76%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season for the 'Gwen Jersey Top' (vest top). Demand has experienced a major step-change starting in Period 16 (late May/early June), shifting from an average of ~55 units to ~107 units over the last 4 periods (101, 103, 88, 136). The most recent demand of 136 units confirms the upward momentum of the peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory (381 units) includes large orders from the last few periods (107, 105, 111) intended to meet this new regime, but current on-hand is 0, indicating we are still trailing the demand spike. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand summer peak regime (average ~107) and its increased volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus the current period (L+1=5) at this new level.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (Period 16-19) confirmed: average demand 107 units, significant increase from previous regime (~55).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21 (July 1st). The current product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (vest top), which is seeing a massive seasonal spike as summer heat peaks in July. Historically, demand shifted from ~55 units (pre-June) to ~97 units in early June, and now has exploded even further: the last two periods saw demand of 136 and 169 units. The mean demand of the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 119.4 units, but the most recent two suggest a trend towards 150+. There is a stockout (on-hand is 0) despite a significant in-transit pipeline, as arrivals from previous lower-regime orders (58 units in P20) cannot keep up with current demand (169 units). To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the summer shift (avg ~120/period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak intensified in late June: Demand reached 169 units in Period 20, up from 101-103 units at the start of June. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is ~120 units/period, compared to ~55 units pre-June.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (vest top), currently in its peak summer season (July 8, 2019). We are experiencing a significant demand surge that began in Period 16 (June) and intensified in Period 20. The most recent demand samples are: P17: 103, P18: 88, P19: 136, P20: 169, P21: 140. Given the date (July), we are at the height of summer demand for this category. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 127 units. We have zero on-hand inventory due to persistent stockouts (demand has exceeded starting inventory for every period since P17). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To avoid further lost sales during this peak, I am transitioning from a 5-period window to a 3-period window (P19-P21) to capture the most recent intensification (avg ~148 units/period). This will raise the base stock level to better match current velocity.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand accelerated further in late June/early July: Average demand for P19-P21 reached ~148 units/period, compared to ~107 in early June (P16-P19).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15. We are in the heart of the summer season for 'Gwen Jersey Top' (a vest top). Historical demand shows a massive surge starting Period 16 (June), peaking around Period 20 (169 units). Period 22 saw a drop to 69 units, but this may be a temporary fluctuation or a stock-out related artifact in consumer behavior, as previous weeks were consistently above 100. The summer peak regime (P16-P22) averages ~129 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. We need to maintain high inventory levels to cover the (L+1) window (5 periods). Given the high volatility (sigma) during this peak, I will use a recent window (N=7) representing the summer regime to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets the elevated demand level (~129 * 5 = 645) while accounting for the high variance of this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P16-P22) shows high volatility with an average of ~129 units/period, despite a single-period dip in P22.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (Vest top), which is currently at the peak of its summer seasonality (late July). Historical data shows a clear regime shift starting in Period 16 (late May), with demand climbing from ~55 to a peak of 169 in Period 20. Over the last 4 periods (P20-P23), demand has averaged 117.25 units, showing high volatility but sustaining a high level despite the recent dip to 69 in Period 22. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 56 units on-hand and high demand expected to persist through July and August, I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average demand ~121) and sigma_hat captures the significant volatility of the summer peak (standard deviation ~38). Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistent 4-period observations.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (Period 16-23) sustained: average demand ~125 units/period with high volatility (range 69-169).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (vest top), which exhibits strong summer seasonality. We are currently in late July (Period 25). Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting in June (Period 16). The average demand from Period 16 to Period 24 is approximately 114 units per period, with significant volatility (highs of 169, lows of 69). The last five periods (P20-P24) averaged 119 units. Although there were stockouts in June, the last three periods (P22-P24) have had sufficient on-hand inventory to meet demand, showing demand values of 69, 91, and 128. This suggests that while previous stockouts masked true demand, the recent average remains high. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high volatility in this peak summer period, I will use a recent_N (N=9, covering the summer regime since P16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand state and its variance while filtering out the pre-summer lower demand levels.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/05. The product is a summer 'vest top', which is currently in its peak demand season. Looking at the demand history since the summer regime shift (Period 16 onwards), demand has averaged approximately 115 units per period (P16-P25: 101, 103, 88, 136, 169, 140, 69, 91, 128, 99). While there was a significant surge in late June (P20: 169), demand in the most recent 4 weeks (P22-P25) has settled into a range of 69-128, averaging 96.75 units. As we are now in early August, demand is expected to remain stable or start a very slow decline from peak summer highs. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Inventory check: On-hand (144) + In-transit (386) = 530 units. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At an estimated 105 units/period (slightly above the recent 4-week average to protect against stockouts during the tail of summer), total inventory required is approximately 525. Current total position of 530 is very close to this requirement. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the full summer regime (avg ~112) while allowing the OR backend to handle the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (Period 16-25) continues with an average of ~115 units/period. The most recent 4 weeks (P22-P25) show a slight cooling to ~97 units/period, suggesting the peak may have plateaued.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are exiting the peak summer season for the 'Gwen Jersey Top' (a vest top/sleeveless item). A significant cooling in demand is evident: Period 26 demand was 45 units, following a lower-than-average Period 25 (99 units). The summer peak average has dropped from ~130 to ~100 over the last 5 periods, and the most recent observation (45 units) suggests a return to the pre-peak spring regime of ~50-60 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (277 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (P21 and P22), while demand is sharping declining. We need to throttle ordering to avoid excessive holding costs as the season ends. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (~100 units/period) to reflect the recent cooling while hedging against the high Period 26 drop, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen during the transition from peak to post-peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Period 26 demand (45 units) is the lowest since the summer peak began in Period 16, signaling the end of seasonal peak demand for vest tops.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Historical demand shows a clear end to the summer peak (P16-P25 avg ~115) with Period 26 and 27 falling to 45 and 49 units respectively. This aligns with the seasonal transition out of summer for a vest top. On-hand inventory is high (229 units) and in-transit is significant (296 units), totaling 525 units against a cooling demand regime. The 'recent_N' method with N=3 will capture this downturn (P25-P27) to prevent further over-ordering while maintaining adequate stock for the post-peak baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling phase confirmed: Demand dropped from triple digits to an average of ~47 units over Periods 26-27, returning to pre-summer levels.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gwen Jersey Top' (a vest top) has clearly entered a post-summer cooling phase as of late August (Period 29). Demand in the last three periods (P26-P28) has dropped significantly to 45, 49, and 55 units respectively, following a summer peak that reached nearly 170 units. This aligns with the seasonal transition out of peak summer wear. My on-hand inventory is currently high (305 units) due to delayed arrivals of large orders placed during the peak (P22 and P24) hitting the warehouse just as demand plummeted. With 305 units on hand and 165 still in transit (from P25 and P26), and a current demand regime of ~50 units/period, I have approximately 9.4 periods of stock available. To prevent further building of excess inventory and minimize holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (the cooling phase) to reflect the lower demand level, and I trust the OR engine's capping mechanism to cease ordering while inventory levels are reconciled.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (early September). The summer peak for 'Gwen Jersey Top' (a sleeveless vest top) has concluded. Historical demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 45, 49, 55, and 85, averaging 58.5 units/period. While P29 saw a slight uptick to 85, the broader trend shows a significant cooling from the mid-summer triple-digit peaks. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 296 units, with 89 units still in-transit (ordered P26, expected in P31). Total available inventory (385 units) comfortably covers over 6 weeks of demand at the current average. To avoid excessive holding costs as the season shifts towards autumn, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (post-cooling) to reflect the lower demand regime and letting the OR backend naturally halt ordering given the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed for Period 30: post-summer regime (P26-P29) average is 58.5 units/period, down from peak >120. Inventory levels are high relative to current demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top', a vest top subject to high summer seasonality. We are currently in early September (2019/9/9), and data from the last five periods (P26-P30) confirms a significant cooling phase after the summer peak. Demand has dropped from a peak of ~125 units/period to an average of ~64 units over the last five weeks (45, 49, 55, 85, 86). Although the last two weeks showed a slight uptick, the overall trend is a return to a mid-range regime. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 299 units with no units in transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods and the current on-hand balance, the system has roughly 4.6 periods of cover (299/64), which exceeds the (L+1) requirement. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the post-summer average and use default for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend due to the high inventory surplus.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 671852003 (Jersey Top) has transitioned from its summer peak demand (which reached >100 units/period) into a stable post-summer cooling phase. The current demand regime, observed since Period 26, averages approximately 66 units per period (P26-P31: 45, 49, 55, 85, 86, 78). This is significantly lower than the peak but slightly higher than the spring baseline of ~50. On-hand inventory is currently high (221 units) compared to this demand level, and there are 89 units in-transit (ordered in Period 31). Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods. 5 periods * ~66 units = 330 units. Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 310 units. While we have a high stock level, it is now approaching the target level for the current regime. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this cooled-down state accurately while allowing for the slight upward trend seen in the last 4 weeks of the cooling phase. This will ensure we maintain a healthy stock without over-ordering as we exit the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime (P26-P31) stabilized at an average of ~66 units/period, down from the summer peak of ~120 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in the post-summer cooling phase for this jersey vest top. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following the June-July peak. Over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), the average demand is 62.7 units (45, 49, 55, 85, 86, 78, 41). The most recent period (P32) recorded 41 units, confirming the downward trend as autumn begins. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. Inventory management is currently focused on clearing the surplus accumulated during the peak-to-cooling transition. On-hand inventory is 180 units and in-transit is 146 units (Total pipeline: 326). Given a 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5), and an average demand of ~63, the required base stock is approximately 315 units. Since our pipeline inventory (326) already exceeds this, the OR engine will likely place minimal or zero orders, which is appropriate to avoid further holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this post-summer average.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The 'Gwen Jersey Top' is a vest top, which has transitioned from its summer peak (>100 units/period) into a stabilized post-summer cooling regime. Since Period 26, demand has averaged approximately 67 units per period (P26-P33: 45, 49, 55, 85, 86, 78, 41, 85). Although demand remains somewhat volatile, the shift away from the triple-digit summer peak is definitive. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods, although recent periods (P31-P33) have not yet seen arrivals due to the lead time gap, which is expected. Current on-hand inventory is 95 units, and in-transit inventory is 171 units (ordered in P31, P32, P33). I will use a recent_N strategy for both demand and lead time to capture the post-summer baseline. I've chosen N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to encompass the entire cooling regime since Period 26, providing a stable estimate for the autumn/winter transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed (P26-P33): Demand regime has leveled to an average of ~67 units/period following the summer peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The SKU 671852003 (Jersey Vest Top) has completed its summer peak and is now in a post-summer stabilization phase. Looking at the demand from Period 26 to Period 34 (late August through September), the average demand is approximately 61.5 units per period (45, 49, 55, 85, 86, 78, 41, 85, 22), which is significantly lower than the summer peak (>120) and slightly higher than the spring regime (~52). The most recent demand (P34) was 22 units, indicating high volatility or a further downward trend as autumn progresses. I will use the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this post-peak regime (P26-P34). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 73 and in-transit at 270 (total pipeline 343), and an average demand of ~62, the system is currently overstocked for the projected demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods), but I must maintain parameters to allow the OR engine to stabilize orders as the pipeline clears. The high sigma reflects the significant volatility observed in this cooling phase.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (vest top), which exhibits clear seasonality. We have moved past the summer peak (Periods 16-25, avg ~115) and are now in a late-autumn cooling phase. Since Period 30, demand has been descending: 86, 78, 41, 85, 22, 18. The current post-peak regime (P30-P35) average is ~55 units, but the most recent two weeks (P34-P35) average only 20 units, reflecting the drop in demand for sleeveless tops in mid-October. Current On-hand (144) plus In-transit (186) remains high relative to this slowing demand. Lead time has been stable at 4 periods (confirmed by Period 35's arrival from Period 31). I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the post-peak level while acknowledging the recent volatility, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the downward variance.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling continues into October: demand significantly dropped from a September average of ~66 units to an October-to-date average of ~20 units (P34: 22, P35: 18), reflecting late-season decline for vest tops.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Gwen Jersey Top' (Vest top), which is highly seasonal. We are now in late October (Period 37), and demand has plummeted as expected for this category. In the last three periods (P34-P36), demand was 22, 18, and 21, establishing a new low-demand regime of approximately 20 units/period. The current inventory position is very high: On-hand is 180 and In-transit is 134, totaling 314 units. Given the current demand (avg ~20), this stock covers over 15 periods, which is far beyond the (L+1=5) period horizon. The OR backend needs to stop ordering to avoid excessive holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect this immediate October cooling. Setting L to 'calculate' to maintain the observed 4-period lead time stability.

Carry-over insight: Late-season regime confirmed starting Period 34 (October): demand dropped to ~20 units/period (P34: 22, P35: 18, P36: 21), down from the September average of ~66.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 671852003 (Jersey Vest Top) has entered a late-season/autumn demand regime. As of Period 37 conclude, demand for the last four periods (P34-P37) has been 22, 18, 21, and 25 units, respectively, averaging 21.5. This is a significant drop from the September average of ~66 and even further from the summer peak (>100). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P35, P36, and P37). On-hand inventory is currently 180 units, and in-transit is 109 units (orders from P34, P35, P36). Total pipeline plus on-hand (289 units) is extremely high given the new demand regime (approx. 13 periods of cover). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this low-demand regime and prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while the current inventory bleeds down.

Carry-over insight: Late-season regime (post-October) for vest tops confirmed: demand stabilized at an average of ~22 units/period (P34-P37), down 67% from the September average (~66).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is a 'Vest top', which is highly seasonal. We have confirmed a significant late-season demand decline starting in October (Period 34). The last 5 periods (P34-P38) show demand levels of 22, 18, 21, 25, and 30, resulting in an average of 23.2 units/period. This is a dramatic drop from the September average of ~66 units and the summer peak of >100. On-hand inventory is currently 249 units, which is extremely high (over 10 weeks of supply at the current demand rate). There are another 10 units in transit (expected from P35/P36 orders). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the obvious end-of-season status, the priority is to stop ordering and bleed off existing inventory. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this new low-demand regime (approx 23 units/period), and lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The high on-hand inventory relative to the calculated base stock will naturally result in zero new orders from the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand floor established: Period 34-38 average demand is 23.2 units/period, confirming a stabilized low-demand regime for the winter months.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product is a vest top, which is now in a clear low-demand off-season regime. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P34-P39) is approximately 23 units/period (22, 18, 21, 25, 30, 22), confirming the floor established in October. We currently have 232 units on hand and only 5 units in transit (ordered P36), totaling 237 units of pipeline inventory. At the current demand rate of ~23 units/period, this inventory covers over 10 periods of demand, significantly exceeding the target base stock level for 1+L (5) periods. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current low-demand regime, the OR backend will correctly suppress further orders to minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods to accurately reflect this late-season floor.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '671852003' (a sleeveless jersey vest top) is now firmly in its late-season/winter low-demand regime. Demand since Period 34 (early October) has consistently averaged ~22 units per period (range 18-30). Current on-hand inventory is 216 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the current review period (1+L=5), and a mean demand of ~22, the required base stock is approximately 110 units. Since current on-hand inventory (216) is nearly double the required base stock for this regime, no further orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (P34-P40) to reflect this stabilized late-season floor, and maintain L at the confirmed value of 4. The high inventory levels are a legacy of the post-summer cooling transition, but given the $1.00 holding cost versus $4.00 profit, we should allow current stocks to deplete naturally.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product (Gwen Jersey Top, a vest top) is in its late-season demand trough. Historical data shows demand has stabilized at a low floor following the summer peak and September tail-off. Specifically, over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), demand has averaged 22.1 units/period, with very low volatility (standard deviation ~3.5). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 198 units with no units in transit. Given the current 8-week average demand of ~22 units, the on-hand inventory provides approximately 9 periods of coverage (198 / 22), which is significantly more than the L+1 window (5 periods) required. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to reflect this stabilized late-season regime and avoid over-ordering during the winter months.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gwen Jersey Top (a vest top) spiked to 107 units in Period 42 (late November). This is an unexpected outlier during the established late-season low-demand regime (~23 units/period). This spike likely corresponds to Black Friday (Nov 29, 2019) promotions. Historical data and the current date (Dec 2) suggest this is a transient event, not a permanent regime change. The inventory on-hand (91 units) is sufficient to cover the next few periods, especially as we expect demand to revert to the established winter low. Given the 'vest top' category, mid-winter demand is naturally low. I will set mu_hat using a 5-period average (recent_N=5) to account for the spike without over-ordering, as the holding cost ($1.0) is significant relative to profit ($4.0). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday demand spike confirmed in Period 42: demand reached 107 units compared to the late-season average of ~23.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), following the Black Friday spike (P42: 107 units). Demand has returned to its late-season baseline (P43: 18 units). The 'late-season' regime (P34-P41, P43) has an average demand of approximately 22.5 units/period. The current on-hand inventory (73) plus the recent order in-transit (103) total 176 units. Given the low winter demand and high holding costs relative to profit ($1 vs $4), we must avoid overstocking while ensuring the OR backend uses the correct demand baseline. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the stabilized low-demand regime (excluding the BF outlier) and using default lead time and sigma calculations. The system is approaching the end of the year (P47), and current inventory plus pipeline comfortably covers the remaining 4 periods of the game.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has returned to the 'late-season floor' of approximately 23 units/period after a brief Black Friday spike (P42: 107 units, P43-44 avg: 26 units). Current inventory (On-hand: 39, In-transit: 147) is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the next several periods, given the current low-demand regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To prevent over-ordering during this low-sales phase and to optimize the backend's base-stock calculation, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 11 periods (P34-P44), which accurately captures the post-October regime and the Black Friday anomaly. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=11) to account for the volatility introduced by the Black Friday spike while maintaining a buffer for late-season fluctuations.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (December 2019), leading into the Christmas/Year-End week. Demand has slightly increased following the Black Friday spike (P42: 107), with recent demand at 34 and 41 units (P44-P45), likely due to holiday gifting and year-end sales. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 163 units in-transit. The order from P43 (103 units) is expected to arrive in Period 47 (the next period), as confirmed lead times have consistently been 4 periods. The recent demand regime (post-Black Friday) averages roughly 30-40 units. Given we are at game period 46 of 47, the final period is imminent. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (P43-P45) to capture this slight holiday lift while ignoring the outlier Black Friday spike, ensuring enough stock to cover the final period's demand without overstocking significantly.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand lift confirmed: Periods 44-45 demand (avg 37.5) shows a minor increase from the late-season floor (~23) following Black Friday.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the late-December/early-January period (Period 47). History shows demand for this vest top is in a low-demand winter regime (avg ~23 units), with a brief spike for Black Friday (P42) and a minor holiday lift (P44-P45: avg 37.5). Period 46 demand returned to 27 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 178 units in-transit. Based on a confirmed 4-period lead time, the order from P43 (103 units) should arrive during Period 47 (visible in P48 start), and the P44 order (44 units) in Period 48. These incoming units will cover the current low demand. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time. Mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the post-holiday late-season demand (avg ~30 including the minor holiday lift) while excluding the distant summer peak and the isolated Black Friday spike. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to account for the recent volatility seen during the holiday weeks.
