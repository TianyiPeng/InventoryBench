This is a staple item ('Everyday Basics') which typically has steady demand but can see a lift during spring/summer transitions. Calendar Context: We are at February 11th. In retail, this is the start of the Spring/Summer transition. Historical Demand: Recent weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) show a significant upward trend (53, 132, 222, 242, 233). This indicates a ramp-up from post-holiday lows into a new, higher demand regime, likely averaging around 230-240 units currently. Inventory & Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit at Period 1, we must cover at least 5 periods of demand (Period 1 through Period 5) to minimize stockouts. Order Logic: Given the recent average of ~235 units, a base requirement for 5 periods is 1,175 units. I will order 1,200 units to establish a pipeline and provide a small buffer for the upward trend detected in January.",

Expected weekly demand is ~270-300. Total demand for 5 periods is ~1350-1500 units.

Current game history (Feb) shows a significant jump to ~300 avg (267, 354, 277). I will forecast based on this higher regime (~300 units/period).

Since actual lead time could vary, and currently on-hand is 0 with lost sales occurring every period, the priority is to build a robust pipeline.

Current on-hand inventory is 383, and lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The goal is to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (P15), requiring inventory to cover 5 periods of demand. Using a conservative forecast of ~200 units/period (reflecting recent lower demand but acknowledging seasonal upside), total demand needed is ~1000 units. Current pipeline (on-hand 383 + in-transit 750) is 1133 units. In-transit consists of 250 units ordered each in P12, P13, and P14, expected to arrive in P16, P17, and P18 respectively. Since the pipeline (1133) comfortably covers the 5-period requirement (1000) and considering local holding costs equal to profit ($1.0), I will place a maintenance order of 250 to keep the arrival stream consistent with the long-term mean demand.",
