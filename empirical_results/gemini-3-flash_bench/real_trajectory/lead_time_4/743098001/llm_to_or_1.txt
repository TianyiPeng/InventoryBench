Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. The product is a thin metal chain necklace, a classic accessory. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a mean of 32.8 units/week (33, 32, 51, 28, 20). There is a slight downward trend in the last two weeks, but Jan 21 saw a significant spike (51), likely related to early Valentine's Day shopping or a specific promotion. Since we are currently in the mid-February period (post-Valentine's Day), demand may normalize or slightly decrease. Given the 4-period promised lead time (L=4), the 'default' mu_hat would lead to a base stock covering (1+4)=5 periods of demand. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime, ensuring the OR backend balances the service level against the relatively high holding cost ($1.0/unit/period, equal to the $1.0 profit/unit).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a seasonal accessory. Looking at the demand history: [33, 32, 51, 28, 20, 20]. There was a peak around 2019-01-21 (51 units), followed by a decline to a stable level of 20 units over the last two periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 52 units in-transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we expect this order to arrive in Period 5 and become visible to us in Period 6. Since we have no 'conclude' messages for arrivals yet, we cannot infer actual lead time shifts; therefore, we will use the default lead time (4). For demand (mu_hat), the recent 2-3 periods show a clear drop from the January levels. I will use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent mean (~22.6 units per period), which results in a baseline mu_hat of (1+L)*22.6. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the lower volatility observed in the current period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-18) shows samples of 33, 32, 51, 28, 20 (pre-game) and 20, 23 (Periods 1-2). Average demand is approximately 29.5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (52 units) and Period 2 (31 units) are in transit. Following the 4-period lead time definition, the P1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales, but the OR backend will calculate the order based on the base stock minus pipeline (83 units). I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full available history including the most recent periods, as demand appears stable with some variance. I will use 'default' for lead time as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU '743098001' is a necklace. Historical demand shows a downward trend (33, 32, 51, 28, 20, 23, 16). The average demand over the last 5 samples is approx 24.8. High on-hand inventory is currently 0 because orders are in-transit. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at Start of Period 6). Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, making the OR backend aim for the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand levels while smoothing out noise, and N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L remains default (4).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/3/11), we are managing SKU 743098001. We have zero on-hand inventory and have experienced lost sales in the first 4 periods because the initial stock was zero and the promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) would arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in Period 5's conclusion message. Therefore, we expect our first arrival next period. Historical demand samples (33, 32, 51, 28, 20) and realized demand in game (20, 23, 16, 8) shows a downward trend. The last 5 observations (including game periods) averaged ~19. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture this lower volume, and 'calculate' for lead time as we await the first confirmation. L is 4, so mu_hat should cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace', a jewelry accessory. Inventory is finally moving: Period 1's order arrived in Period 5 (actual lead time = 4, matching promised). On-hand is 42. In-transit is 79 (from orders in Periods 2 and 3). Historical demand samples (last 10 weeks) are: 33, 32, 51, 28, 20 (pre-game) and 20, 23, 16, 8, 10 (Period 1-5). There is a clear downward trend in demand since February, dropping from a mean of ~33 to ~15. Looking at the calendar, mid-February (Valentine's Day) likely caused the earlier spike, and we are now in a post-holiday trough. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this lower regime (mean ~15.4) and 'default' for sigma to ensure we don't under-stock if volatility returns. Lead time (L) is confirmed at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-Valentine's Day: Demand dropped from ~33 (Jan/early Feb) to ~15 (late Feb/March).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (March 25, 2019). Analyzing the history, demand has plummeted following the Valentine's Day period (mid-February). From Period 1-3, demand averaged ~20 units/week. From Period 4-6, demand dropped significantly to 8, 10, and 7 units respectively (average ~8.33). The 'Flirty Linnea necklace' appears to be a seasonal item that peaked in early February and is now in a low-demand phase. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5; P2 arrived P6). Current inventory is high: on-hand (66) + in-transit (48) = 114 units, whereas current demand is <10 units/period. The OR engine needs to recognize the shift to avoid over-ordering. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-holiday low-demand regime (Periods 4, 5, 6).

Carry-over insight: Post-Valentine's demand drop confirmed: Mean demand shifted from ~20 to ~8 (60% decrease) between Feb and March.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace', which showed high demand leading up to Valentine's Day (30-50 units) and then a significant drop in late February and March (8-10 units). However, Period 7 saw a sudden spike to 59 units. This spike is likely idiosyncratic or related to a late March/early April event (e.g., Mother's Day preparations or spring fashion transitions). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). We currently have 55 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Calculated mean demand including the recent spike is approximately 20-25 units, but the last 3 periods (P5-P7) averaged 25.3 units. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the shift from the low of March to the recent spike, and 'calculate' for L as the 4-period lead time is consistent. Sigma will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the increased variance observed in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late March/early April: Period 7 saw a spike to 59 units after a 4-week period averaging <10 units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). The product is a thin metal chain necklace, which fits into fashion accessories. Looking at the demand history: Jan/Early Feb demand was ~33-51 units. After Valentine's Day (Period 1), it dropped significantly (8, 10, 7). However, the last two periods (P7 and P8) saw a massive spike back up to 59 and 50 units respectively. This likely correlates with the 'Spring' transition or preparation for Easter/Spring events in April. On-hand inventory is critically low (5 units) while in-transit is 50 units (ordered Period 8, expected Period 12). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on P5, P6, and P7 arrivals. Because the demand has shifted from a low period (<10) to a high period (~50), I need to adjust mu_hat to capture this recent upward trend. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat takes the average of P6, P7, and P8 (7, 59, 50 = ~38.6), which is safer than the long-term average but reflects the recent surge. sigma_hat also needs to reflect this high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed in late March/early April (P7-P8): Demand increased from ~8 units to ~55 units (+500%), likely seasonal Spring/Easter interest.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019-04-15). Historical demand shows a significant seasonal surge starting late March (Period 7: 59 units, Period 8: 50 units, Period 9: 32 units). The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace', which likely saw a spike due to the Spring/Easter season (Easter Sunday 2019 was April 21). We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have 135 units in transit (ordered in Periods 8 and 9). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7) confirm an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 8 are expected to arrive in Period 12. Given the recent demand shift, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the high-demand Spring regime (average of 59, 50, 32 is ~47 per period) and for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. L is set to default (4) as the observed lead time is stable.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/4/22), we are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and awaiting arrivals. Historical analysis confirms a lead time of 4 periods (validated in P5, P6, and P7). The next expected shipment (50 units ordered in P8) should arrive during Period 12 and be visible at the start of Period 13. We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in late March (P7), likely driven by spring seasonality/Easter for this jewelry SKU. Since P7, demand has been 59, 50, 32, and 25 (average ~41.5 units/period). This is a significant increase from the pre-P7 average of ~15 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime over the (L+1=5) lookahead period. I will also use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed during this surge. L is set to default (promised 4) as arrivals have been consistent with this timing.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098001' (necklace) is currently in an out-of-stock situation with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows a seasonal demand surge starting mid-March (P7), with demand fluctuating between 25-59 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrivals in P5, P6, and P7 (all ordered 4 periods prior). Orders placed in P8 (50 units), P9 (85 units), P10 (70 units), and P11 (3 units) are currently in-transit (total 208 units). The P8 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 12 and will be visible in the next 'conclude' message. Given the current date (late April), demand is expected to remain in the 25-35 range seen in the last three periods (P9-P11). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (P8-P11) to capture this post-spike stabilization while accounting for the high demand seen in early April. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to capture the volatility of the seasonal transition. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as historical lead times have consistently been 4, matching the promise.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/05/06 (Period 13). We are in a post-Easter period. History shows a major demand surge in late March/early April (P7-P8) of ~50-60 units, which has since cooled to ~20-30 units (mean of P9-P12 is 26). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent based on arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P12. Currently, we have 31 units on hand and 158 units in transit. The in-transit units include orders from P9 (85 units), P10 (70 units), and P11 (3 units). Order P9 is expected to arrive in P13 (concluding at the start of P14), and P10 in P14. Our inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 189 units. Given the recent demand average of ~26 units/week and L=4, a standard (L+1) base stock would be around 130 units. We are currently over-inventoried due to the large orders placed during the stockout/surge phase (P9-P10). I will use a recent_N (N=4) to capture the current post-surge demand level (~26) and set L to default (4). The backend cap will likely prevent further ordering until pipeline inventory clears.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand stabilization: Since the late March surge, demand has stabilized at a mean of ~26 units (Periods 9-12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/05/13 (Period 14). We are managing the 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data (P5, P6, P7, P12, P13) consistently confirms the actual lead time L=4. Demand analysis: After an Easter surge (P7-P8), demand has stabilized. For the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand values were 32, 25, 28, 19, and 33. This gives a mean of 27.4 units/week. Since the current on-hand inventory (83) plus in-transit (73: from P10 and P11) equals 156 units, and the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5) is approximately 137 units (27.4 * 5), the system is well-stocked. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-Easter stability while filtering out the early-year volatility and the significant demand drop seen in March. I will keep L at 'default' since it aligns with the observed lead time of 4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a thin metal chain necklace. Looking at demand history, we saw a significant spike in Period 14 (78 units), which is much higher than the previous 4-period average of ~26 units (Periods 10-13). This spike corresponds to mid-May, potentially driven by early summer fashion trends or events like Mother's Day preparations. Lead times have remained stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 12, 13, and 14). We currently have 75 units on-hand and 3 units in-transit (ordered Period 11, expected to arrive during the current Period 15 and be visible in Period 16). Given that the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which means we should target the median demand. To capture the recent spike without over-reacting to a single-period outlier, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average demand of ~36.6) and sigma_hat to account for the recent jump in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in mid-May (Period 14): Demand jumped to 78 units from a previous 5-period average of 27 units (+188%).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098001' (necklace) is experiencing a massive seasonal demand surge in late May. Period 15 demand spiked to 156 units, following a jump to 78 in Period 14. This suggests a significant regime shift, likely related to early summer fashion or specific late-May holidays/events. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with 76 units in-transit (ordered in Period 15). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, and 15). Given the recent demand explosion (78, then 156), the historical mean of ~30-40 is no longer representative. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture this upward momentum (~89 units/period). I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to account for the high volatility accompanying this surge. Setting L to 'calculate' to rely on the stable observed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge confirmed in late May (Period 14-15): Demand increased from ~30 units to 156 units (+400%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098001' (Flirty Linnea necklace) is currently experiencing a massive demand surge that began in mid-May (P14-P15) and has continued into early June (P16 demand = 165). This aligns with seasonal demand for accessories during the late spring/early summer transition. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and lost out on the entire demand of 165 units in Period 16. However, there is a significant Pipeline (In-transit: 268 units), including 76 units ordered in P15 and 192 units ordered in P16. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across five data points (P5, P6, P7, P12, P13, P14, P15). Given the current demand is 165 units, and our recent history shows a clear regime shift from ~27 units to ~160 units, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (P14-P16) to capture this new high-demand environment. I'll maintain L as 'calculate' since it has been stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Demand for the last two periods (P15-P16) averaged 160 units, a 500% increase over the mid-spring average of ~27 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098001' (Flirty Linnea necklace) has entered a high-demand regime starting in mid-May (Period 14). Demand in the last three periods (P15-P17) has been 156, 165, and 153 units respectively, compared to the spring average of ~26. This represents a sustained jump to a mean of ~158 units per week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant stockouts occurring, the priority is to maintain a high base stock to capture this surge. We use the last 3 samples (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new regime, and 'calculate' for lead time since observed lead times are stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (May/June) confirmed: Demand stable at ~158 units/period over the last 3 weeks (P15-P17), a significant increase from previous levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We have observed a significant high-demand regime throughout May and early June, with weekly demand figures of 78, 156, 165, and 153. However, Period 18 saw a sharp drop to 38 units. Given the 'Flirty Linnea necklace' product description, the previous surge was likely related to early summer/festival season preparations, which may now be cooling or exhibiting high volatility. We are currently stocked out on-hand due to this surge but have a massive pipeline of 649 units in-transit (ordered in P15-P18). To avoid massive over-ordering if the drop to 38 units persists, I am transitioning the mu_hat calculation to use a recent_N window. Specifically, N=5 captures the high peak (P14-P17) and the recent drop (P18), resulting in a balanced 5-period mean of ~118 units. This reflects the high-demand level while incorporating the most recent cooling signal. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in mid-June: Period 18 demand dropped to 38 units after a 4-week high-demand average of ~138 units, suggesting a potential end or cooling of the early summer peak.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are seeing a significant cooling in demand after a high-summer peak in late May/early June. Period 18 demand was 38 and Period 19 demand was 59, compared to the peak levels of ~160. This confirms a downward shift from the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P15 order arriving in P19). I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the pivot from the 160 units peak down to the current ~50 units level. With Profit=1 and Holding=1, the target service level is 50%, which means the OR engine will target the median demand. Given the current on-hand inventory (17) and heavy in-transit pipeline (573), large orders are unlikely, but the parameters must reflect the current lower demand regime to avoid further over-ordering once the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed post-early summer peak: Last two periods (P18-P19) averaged ~48.5 units, a 70% decrease from the P15-P17 peak average of ~158 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. After a significant demand peak in late May/early June (averaging ~150 units), demand has cooled over the last three periods (P18-P20) to an average of 51.3 units (38, 59, 57). This suggests a transition from a summer peak to a more stable mid-summer demand regime. On-hand inventory is currently 152 with 381 units in transit (expected arrivals from P17 and P18 orders totaling 381 units in the coming periods). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the cooling demand, I am using a recent_N of 3 to capture this new, lower demand level (avg ~51) to avoid over-ordering and incurring high holding costs ($1.0/unit), while maintaining enough stock to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand stabilization confirmed: Period 18-20 demand averaged 51 units, following the early summer peak of ~150 units, representing a sustained return to moderate demand levels.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. We are in a post-summer-peak cooling phase. Demand peaked significantly in late May/early June (P15-P17) with values around 160 units, but has since stabilized at a lower level. The last four periods (P18-P21) show demand values of 38, 59, 57, and 93, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 62 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (271 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (P16 and P17). With 169 units still in-transit (ordered P18, expected arrival next period P23) and on-hand inventory already covering over 4 periods of recent demand, we are well-stocked. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stabilized mid-summer demand levels while moving away from the extreme May outliers.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand has transitioned from the May/June peak (avg ~150) to a moderate mid-summer regime. Over the last four periods (P19-P22), demand has been 59, 57, 93, 97, averaging 76.5 units. The most recent two weeks (P21-P22) show a slight uptick to ~95 units compared to the ~60 units seen in P19-P20. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (343 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the previous peak, while in-transit inventory is zero. I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stabilized mid-summer demand (~76.5/week), allowing the inventory to naturally draw down before placing new orders. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) stabilized higher than initial post-peak cooling: Last 4 periods (P19-P22) average 76.5 units, compared to the 50 average predicted in P21.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The necklace SKU is currently in a stable July-peak demand regime, averaging 88.8 units per period over the last 5 weeks (P19-P23: 59, 57, 93, 97, 108). This is higher than the early-July stabilization estimate of 76.5 units mentioned in Carry-over insights. Total inventory on hand is high (235 units), which covers current demand for approximately 2.6 periods. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (235) and small pipeline (40 units arriving from P23), total inventory position is 275. To maintain service levels against the current demand trend (approx. 90/week) across the L+1 window (5 periods), we require approximately 450 units. However, I must allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate buffer based on the recent volatility (the 57 to 108 range). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture this specific July regime and prevent over-stocking if demand begins its late-summer decline.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) strengthened and stabilized: Last 5 periods (P19-P23) average 88.8 units, showing a steady climb from 57 to 108 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for the 'Flirty Linnea necklace' has stabilized into a mid-summer regime. Over the last 6 periods (P19-P24), demand has been 59, 57, 93, 97, 108, and 101, averaging approximately 86 units per period. This follows the late spring/early summer peak (~150 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent five arrivals (P19-P22). Given the inventory position (on-hand: 134, in-transit: 162, total pipeline: 296) and the current average demand of ~86 units, the stock covers approximately 3.4 periods of demand. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to maintain a base stock covering L+1 (5) periods. I will use the last 6 periods to calculate the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this stabilized July regime, while keeping L at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) stabilized: Demand from P19-P24 averaged 85.8 units (std ~22), markedly higher than the June cooling period (~50 units).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). For the SKU 743098001 (Flirty Linnea necklace), demand has moved out of the early summer peak (~150 units in June) and settled into a mid-summer regime. Over the last 7 periods (P19-P25), demand has averaged 83.7 units, with the most recent three periods (P23-P25) showing 108, 101, and 71 units (average 93.3). This suggests a sustained demand level significantly higher than the initial post-peak cooling estimated in June. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 18 order in Period 22. With 63 units on-hand and 285 units in-transit (ordered P23-P25), the total pipeline covers the expected lead-time demand. I will use a recent_N calculation for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this mid-summer average of ~84 units per period across the lead time of 4 periods (plus the current period, total L+1=5). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to account for the current volatility (std ~20). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July/August) stabilized: Demand from P19-P25 averaged 83.7 units, significantly higher than the June cooling estimate of ~50.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098001' (Flirty Linnea necklace) is currently in a mid-to-late summer regime. As of Period 27 (2019/08/12), demand has been stable over the last 8 weeks (P19-P26), averaging 83.6 units per week. The ending inventory for Period 26 was 0, with a stockout occurring (82 demand vs 63 on-hand). While there are 356 units currently in-transit, the system's order for Period 27 must ensure that the base stock (covering L+1 periods) accounts for the current demand level. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Since the current demand regime (post-June cooling) began at P19, I will use N=8 (the length of the stable regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent mean and volatility accurately. This balances the risk of further stockouts against the holding cost of units arriving in late August.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand has consistently stabilized into a mid-summer/late-summer regime. Over the last 9 periods (P19-P27), demand has averaged 86 units, showing relative stability compared to the extreme surges seen in May/June. Specifically, the last 4 periods average 89.75 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 378 units. Significant stockouts occurred in Period 26 and 27 due to the lag in replenishment cycles. I will use the recent 9-period average (P19-P27) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the most stable current demand regime since the post-peak cooling in June. This historical window (N=9) balances the need to capture recent high demand (105 in P27) while smoothing out previous fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Mid-to-late summer demand regime (July/August) confirmed: Demand from P19-P27 averaged 86 units, maintaining a significantly higher level than the early June cooling period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019/8/26). Recent demand has shown a significant upward trend (Period 26: 82, Period 27: 105, Period 28: 137), suggesting a late summer or pre-autumn surge for this accessory SKU. The last 3-period average is approx 108 units. Although the previous 'mid-summer' regime (P19-P27) averaged around 86 units, the immediate momentum is higher. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P23 arrived P27, P24 arrived P28). On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 308 units in-transit (orders from P25, P26, P27, and P28). To capture the recent demand acceleration while maintaining safety stock against the observed volatility (std of recent periods is ~28), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the period where demand moved from ~70s to 130s) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect this increased variance. Lead time 'L' remains at 'default' (4).

Carry-over insight: Late August demand surge: Demand increased from approx 80 to 137 units per period over the last 3 weeks (P26-P28), exceeding the mid-summer average of 86.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 743098001 is currently experiencing a late summer/early September demand surge. Over the last four periods (P26-P29), demand values were 82, 105, 137, and 123, averaging approximately 112 units. This is a significant increase from the previous mid-summer average of 86. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P23, P24, and P25 in P27, P28, and P29 respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 324 units in transit (orders from P26, P27, P28, and P29). To prevent stockouts during this sustained high-demand period while accounting for the current pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value based on the recent average of 115 units per period across the lead time plus review period (1+4=5), resulting in 575 units. Sigma_hat is set using the recent_N method (N=7) to capture the increased volatility observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late summer/early autumn demand surge confirmed: P26-P29 demand averaged 112 units, a 30% increase over the previous mid-summer regime of 86 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 743098001 is currently in a sustained late-summer/early-autumn demand surge. Demand over the last five periods (P26-P30) has been 82, 105, 137, 123, and 132, averaging approximately 116 units. This is significantly higher than the mid-summer average of 86. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there have been stockouts in the last five periods (sold < demand), I need to maintain a robust base stock level. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime (approx. 116 units/period). This results in a target pipeline covering (4+1)*116 = 580 units. Currently, there are 406 units in-transit and 0 on-hand, implying an order of roughly 174 units, which the OR backend will calculate based on these parameters and the 95% service level cap.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in a late summer/early autumn demand regime. Over the last 4 periods (P28-P31), demand has averaged 121.75 units (137, 123, 132, 95), which supports the previously identified surge (Carry-over Period 30) of roughly 112 units. Although Period 31 saw a dip to 95, the overall trend remains elevated compared to the mid-summer average of 86. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31. Inventory is currently constrained with 0 on-hand, despite high in-transit quantities, as demand has consistently outpaced recent arrivals. For Period 32, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this sustained higher demand level (~122/period) and maintain L at default (promised 4).

Carry-over insight: Late summer/early autumn demand regime (Sept) confirmed: Demand from P28-P31 averaged 121.8 units, sustaining the elevation above the mid-summer average of 86.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The 'Flirty Linnea necklace' is currently in a late summer/early autumn demand regime. While periods 28-31 showed a high average of ~122 units, the most recent demand in Period 32 dropped to 76 units. Although the carry-over insight suggests a stabilized higher regime for September, the volatility is significant. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 557 units in-transit. Arrivals have consistently followed a 4-period lead time. However, due to recent stockouts (Periods 26-32 ending at 0), we have lost sales and need to maintain a robust base stock to capture the current demand levels. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering Periods 28-32) which averages 100.6 units per period, providing a safer buffer than the long-term average while acknowledging the recent dip. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture the current volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand for the 'Flirty Linnea necklace' has been elevated since late August, with a 'late summer/early autumn demand regime' confirmed in previous periods. Over the last six periods (P28-P33), demand has averaged 104 units (137, 123, 132, 95, 76, 117), which is higher than the mid-summer average of 86 but shows some fluctuation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 22 and in-transit at 424 (covering orders from periods 30, 31, 32, and 33), the stock position is relatively strong for the next few cycles. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current autumn demand level (approx 104 units/period) while accounting for recent volatility. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock target aligned with the observed 100+ units/period demand pattern.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The necklace is currently in a sustained late-year demand regime. Over the last 7 periods (P28-P34), demand has averaged 109 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22 units. Recently, demand has shown some moderation (117, 90 in the last two periods), but remains significantly higher than the mid-summer average of 86. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P34 confirmed P30 order arrived in 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 85, with 392 units in-transit. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current early autumn demand regime while acknowledging the recent slight cooling.

Carry-over insight: Early autumn demand regime (Sept-Oct) confirmed: Demand from P28-P34 averaged 109 units (std 22), representing a stabilization near the late summer levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand has recently softened, with the last two periods showing 90 and 63 units, compared to the early autumn average of 109 units (P28-P34). Over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 87.4 units. On-hand inventory is healthy at 175 units, and 312 units are in transit. Specifically, an order of 112 units from P32 is expected to arrive during the current period (P36), followed by 6 units from P33 in the next. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the cooling trend in demand as we move deeper into October, I will use a shorter window (N=5) for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to avoid over-ordering based on the higher September averages, while maintaining the default sigma_hat to account for historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling in mid-October: Demand from P34-P35 averaged 76.5 units, a 30% decrease from the Sept/Oct regime average of 109 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098001' is entering a cooling phase in late October. Demand has decreased from a September/early October average of ~109 units to an average of 54.5 units over the last two periods (P35-P36). Currently, on-hand inventory is 241 units and there are 200 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 33-35). Specifically, 6 units from P33 and 121 units from P34 are expected to arrive in the next two periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high current inventory relative to the lower demand, the primary goal is to avoid overstocking while the regime stabilizes. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent cooling (approx 66 units/period), and L is kept at 'default' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. No further orders are likely triggered due to the high pipeline, which is appropriate for a cooling regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed in mid-to-late October: Last 3 periods averaged 66.3 units, a ~40% drop from the September regime average of 109 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in a confirmed cooling phase after the late summer/early autumn peak. Demand over the last four periods (P34-P37) has been 90, 63, 46, and 89, averaging 72 units per period. This is a significant drop from the September average of ~110. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (158 units), and we have 194 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P34, P35, P36=0, P37=0). Specifically, 121 units from P34 are due this period (P38), and 73 units from P35 are due in P39. Given the high on-hand and pipeline stock relative to the new lower demand regime (~72 units/period), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to reflect this cooling. I will use the default lead time (L=4) as it has been stable. This approach should prevent over-ordering while inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime (Oct) confirmed: Last 4 periods (P34-P37) average 72 units, approx 35% lower than the late summer peak of 110 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a cooling demand regime that began in mid-October. Demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has averaged 73 units, compared to the September average of ~110 units. The most recent demand (P38) was 77 units, confirming a stabilization around the mid-70s. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P34 order arrived in P38). Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 202) due to larger orders placed during the previous high-demand regime arriving now. To prevent excessive holding costs during this lower demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the cooling trend while ignoring the older, higher demand peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime (Oct/Nov) sustained: Last 5 periods (P34-P38) average 73 units, confirming a ~35% drop from the September peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following the September peak. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 71.7 units with a standard deviation of 15.8. This confirms the 'cooling' regime noted in previous carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (210 units) with 90 units in-transit (8 units from P38, 82 units from P39). Given the holding cost and profit are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend will target the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this lower demand regime accurately for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the 'default' lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime (mid-Oct/Nov) sustained: Last 6 periods (P34-P39) average ~72 units, confirming a 35% drop from the September peak (~110 units).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a 'cooling' regime since mid-October. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged 69.1 units, down significantly from the September average of ~110 units. The most recent period (P40) saw demand of 54 units. Inventory is currently healthy with 156 units on-hand and 149 in-transit (orders from P38, P39, and P40), which is sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods) at the current demand rate (5 * 69 = 345 units needed; currently have 156 + 149 = 305). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower-demand regime while allowing for the slight downward trend seen in the most recent five weeks (90, 63, 46, 89, 77, 65, 54).

Carry-over insight: Mid-Nov demand stabilization: Demand from P34-P40 averaged 69 units, confirming a sustained lower-demand regime for late autumn compared to the summer/early autumn peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a lower-demand autumn/winter regime. Over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), demand has averaged 69.0 units, significantly lower than the ~110 units seen in early autumn. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since P40, two shipments of 0 units arrived (likely due to zero orders in P36 and P37), and we have 190 units currently in-transit (P38: 8, P39: 82, P40: 59, P41: 41), which aligns with the demand levels. I will use a recent_N window of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime (P34-P41) while keeping L at the promised 4 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are in a confirmed late autumn/early winter regime where demand has stabilized around ~65-70 units per period (P34-P42 avg: ~68). Period 42 demand was 63. Inventory position: On-hand is 33, and In-transit is 249 (comprising orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (P42 saw the arrival of the P38 order). We are approaching the end of the year, and while this necklace (Flirty Linnea) could see a holiday gift-giving spike, the historical data for 2019 shows a cooling trend since September. I will use a recent_N of 9 for mu_hat to capture the regime since mid-October (P34-P42), which effectively balances the recent moderate demand while remaining responsive to any slight holiday uptick.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand has recently dropped to 26 units (P43), significantly lower than the late-autumn average of ~69 units. Historically, we saw a similar drop in early spring. As we are approaching mid-December, demand for this 'Flirty Linnea necklace' may be cooling further or stabilizing at a lower level before any potential holiday spike. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the most recent cooling trend (avg ~53 units) while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent reduction in variance. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods across all historical arrivals, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed in early December: P43 demand dropped to 26 units, bringing the 4-period average (P40-P43) down to 53 units, compared to the previous regime of 69 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in a clear late-autumn/early-winter cooling phase. Demand over the last two periods (P43-P44) has dropped significantly to an average of 21.5 units, compared to the previous regime of 69 units. This suggests a seasonal 'lull' before any potential end-of-year activity, or simply a post-autumn decline. The inventory position is currently high (On-hand: 131, In-transit: 168) relative to this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp drop in demand (P43: 26, P44: 17), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture this cooling regime quickly and avoid further overstocking as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 47).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop in early December confirmed: P43-P44 demand averaged 21.5 units, a 70% decrease from the mid-Nov regime of 69 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-40.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December (Period 46). Demand for this necklace has historically shown seasonality, with a significant drop in early December (confirmed in Carry-over Insights as ~21.5 units) followed by a rebound to 66 units in Period 45, likely due to pre-Christmas/holiday shopping. Given that Period 46 is the week of Christmas (Dec 23rd), we expect demand to remain higher than the early December lull but potentially cool slightly after the peak. The on-hand inventory is 106, and in-transit is 127 (remaining orders from P42 and P43). Total pipeline inventory is 233. For mu_hat, I will use a 5-period average (P41-P45) which averages ~48 units per period to capture the recent holiday volatility while acknowledging the lower baseline observed since mid-November. L remains stable at 4 periods. Since the critical value q is 0.5 (Profit=1, Holding=1), the OR backend will target a base stock equal to the median of the distribution over L+1 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year holiday demand rebound: Period 45 demand spiked to 66 units, interrupting the early December cooling trend (avg ~21 units).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product is a thin metal chain necklace, which typically sees demand spikes around holidays like Valentine's Day and early summer. We are currently coming off a holiday demand rebound (P45 demand: 66, P46 demand: 53) following a significant drop in early December (avg ~21). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 120 and 67 units in-transit (reaching only P47-P50), we must account for the likelihood that demand will stabilize post-New Year but before the mid-January ramp-up for Valentine's Day. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P43-P46) to capture the recent holiday fluctuation (avg ~40.5) while maintaining a standard sigma to handle the transition into January. No order was placed in P44-P45, so the pipeline is relatively thin.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand rebound observed in late December: Periods 45-46 averaged 59.5 units, up from the early December average of ~21 units (+180%).
