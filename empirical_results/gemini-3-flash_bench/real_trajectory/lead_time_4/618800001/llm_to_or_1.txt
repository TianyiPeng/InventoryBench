Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 618800001, a women's satin vest top. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks shows a stable mean (approx 146 units/week). Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, and the promised lead time is 4 periods, we need to place an order that covers demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Given no prior 'conclude' messages to infer actual lead time shifts, I will use the promised lead time. I'll use the available 5 historical samples to set the baseline demand forecast (recent_N=5) and stick to defaults for lead time and volatility until observations suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is a 'V-neck satin top', which is a standard 'Womens Everyday' item. Historical demand (5 weeks) showed a mean of ~146 units. Period 1 demand was 144, which is consistent with this range. The promised lead time is 4. The order of 164 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Since current on-hand is 0 and we have a 4-period lead time, we have a stockout until the first order arrives. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 4), and 'recent_N' for demand parameters based on the 6 available data points (5 historical + 1 observed). This covers the (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). This item is a 'V-neck satin top', which is a spring/summer staple. Historically, demand has been stable but slightly increasing from 133-165 (mean ~146). The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 164 units, and in Period 2, 162 units (Total In-transit: 326). Neither has arrived yet, which is expected as the promised lead time is 4. Since the item is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) and we've already missed sales in P1 and P2, we need to maintain a steady pipeline. I will use the default promised lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 5 samples (133, 150, 139, 160, 144, 165) which average around 148, but the last two observed samples (144, 165) suggest a slight uptick as we move into spring. I'll use recent_N=5 to capture this recent average which provides a mu_hat of approx 740 (5 periods * 148). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). We are selling a 'V-neck satin top', which is a seasonal spring/summer fashion item. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) hovered around 133-160 units. However, in the last 3 periods of play, we have seen a clear upward trend: 144, 165, and 184 units. This suggests a transition into spring seasonality where demand for vest tops increases. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods; the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Total in-transit is 496 (P1: 164 + P2: 162 + P3: 170). Since we have no concluded arrivals yet, we must stick to the promised lead time L=4. For demand, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent growth trend (mean of 144, 165, 184 is approx 164.3). This ensures mu_hat reflects the current upward trajectory rather than the lower January baseline.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a 'V-neck satin top', which is a spring/summer fashion item. Historical demand (pre-game) averaged ~146 units. Recent in-game demand (Periods 1-4) has shown a clear upward trend: 144, 165, 184, 188 (average of last three is 179). This aligns with the transition into spring (March). Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (164 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, meaning it will be available to satisfy Period 5 demand but only visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Currently, on-hand is 0, which is expected given L=4. In-transit is 694, matching the sum of orders from P1-P4 (164+162+170+198). To account for the increasing demand trend, I will use a mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (average 179) scaled by (1+L) = 5, resulting in 895. Sigma_hat will use the recent 3 periods to capture the increased volatility during this growth phase.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'V-neck satin top', which is a spring/summer fashion item. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~146 units/week. However, since Period 1 (mid-Feb), demand has increased to an average of 170.2 units/week (P1-P5: 144, 165, 184, 188, 170), indicating a seasonal shift as spring approaches. Period 5 confirmed a lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5), which matches the promised lead time. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory because the P1 arrival (164 units) was immediately exhausted by P5 demand (170 units). We have 730 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), with the P2 order (162 units) expected to arrive during Period 6. Given the consistent increase in demand from the pre-game samples to the game history, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture this higher 'active' mean (~170) while the OR backend handles the (L+1) multiplier. For sigma_hat, I'll also use recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 2: Average weekly demand increased from ~146 (pre-game) to ~170 (+16%). Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU is a 'V-neck satin top', which typically sees increasing demand as spring progresses toward summer. The carry-over insight correctly identified a demand shift starting in Period 2. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P2-P6), the demand mean has shifted to 182.2 (165, 184, 188, 170, 204), compared to the pre-game mean of 146. Inventory remains critical; we have ended with 0 on-hand for two consecutive periods despite arrivals of ~162 units, indicating we are under-stocked relative to current demand spikes (P6 demand was 204). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P5 and P6 arrivals both had L=4). Therefore, I will set L to 'default' (4), and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and its volatility (std \u2248 15.6). This will allow the OR engine to set a base stock covering (4+1=5) periods of the current demand level.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a women's satin V-neck vest top, which is entering its peak spring/summer season. Demand has shown a steady upward trend over the last 4 periods (170, 204, 257) and we are currently stock-out constrained, losing sales because demand exceeds our starting on-hand inventory. The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the seasonality of a vest top in April, demand is expected to remain high or continue rising. I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the higher mean of 194.6 units per period since the shift began in Period 2. Using N=6 balances the recent high spikes with the slightly lower early-regime data to avoid over-ordering on a potential outlier spike, while still accounting for the significant growth. mu_hat will be set to cover 5 periods (L+1) of this higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Average demand from Periods 2-7 is ~195 units, significantly higher than the pre-game average of 146. A strong seasonal spike (257) was observed in late March.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/04/08). Data shows a significant and accelerating demand shift. Pre-game demand was ~146, while the average of the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is 256.25, and P8 alone spiked to 394 (+170% vs baseline). This product (V-neck satin top) is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Currently, On-hand inventory is 0 because demand (394) drastically exceeded the arriving stock (198). The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by four consecutive arrivals (P5-P8). To address the massive demand acceleration, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this new high-demand regime while weighting recent volatility. The OR backend needs to recognize that the 'normal' demand level is now much higher to avoid persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and accelerating: Average demand Periods 5-8 is 256 (+75% over baseline), with a peak of 394 in Period 8. Consistent lead time of 4 periods confirmed.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '618800001' (Womens Vest Top) is currently in a high-demand seasonal phase, likely driven by the transition into spring/summer fashion. Demand has been volatile but significantly elevated compared to the baseline, with a notable peak of 394 in Period 8 and a 4-period moving average (P6-P9) of approximately 265 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because all arrivals are being immediately consumed by high demand; we have been stocking out for 5 consecutive periods despite arrivals. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are entering mid-April, demand for 'super-skinny shoulder strap' vest tops is expected to remain high or continue growing. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 6-9) while smoothing out the extreme spike in Period 8. This results in a mu_hat covering L+1 (5) periods, directing the OR backend to target a higher base stock to stop the persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime: Average demand for Periods 6-9 is 265 units, compared to the initial baseline of 146. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the 'Leona V-neck satin top' is experiencing a significant demand regime shift compared to the pre-game baseline. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 258.8 units, compared to the initial 5-sample average of 143 units. Although there was a peak in late March (P8: 394), demand has stabilized at a higher level (P9: 206, P10: 233). Seasonal context (Spring/Summer) suggests this higher demand will likely persist as vest tops are seasonally relevant. Deliveries are consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods (P6 order arrived P10). However, 'On-hand' inventory is currently 0, indicating back-to-back stockouts due to the demand surge outstripping historical order levels. To recover and maintain an adequate service level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods of demand (N=5) to capture the new baseline (~1300 for L+1), and sigma_hat also based on N=5 to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation ~73). L will remain at 'default' since the promised lead time of 4 is being met precisely.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime shift confirmed: Mean weekly demand for Periods 6-10 is ~259 units, an 80% increase over the pre-game baseline of 143. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we are entering the peak spring/early summer season for a 'V-neck satin top'. Demand has shifted significantly from a pre-game baseline of ~146 to a recent mean of ~269 over the last 5 periods (P7-P11), representing an 84% increase. Inventory remains critical: on-hand is currently 0, and we have consistently stocked out (sold = arrived < demand). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The large in-transit (1234 units) reflects recently placed high-volume orders (P8 with 250, P9 with 419, P10 with 413) that are scheduled to arrive in future periods. To capture the current high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the mean of ~269 per period. Given the higher volatility (394 peak) and the high cost of stockouts relative to holding cost (4:1 ratio), N=5 also allows the backend to capture recent variance for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime shift confirmed: Mean weekly demand for Periods 7-11 is ~269 units, an 84% increase over the pre-game baseline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '618800001' (Womens Satin V-neck top) is entering its peak season (May). Historically, demand has increased from a baseline of ~143 units to a sustained higher regime. For Periods 8-12, the average demand is 272.8 units (394, 206, 233, 306, 225). While Period 12 showed a slight dip to 225, the overall trend since March indicates a high-demand environment consistent with late spring apparel. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on multiple arrivals (Periods 5-12). Our current on-hand inventory is 25, with a significant pipeline (1286 units). To prevent stockouts during this likely sustained high-demand period while accounting for recent volatility (high of 394, low of 206), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation. This captures the current regime (avg ~273) and the recent volatility more accurately than the long-term average. The backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the review period (total 5 periods of demand).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. The product is a 'V-neck satin top with super-skinny shoulder straps,' which is a summer-seasonal item. Historically, we saw a demand surge in April (peaking at 394), but demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (225 in Period 12 and a sharp drop to 60 in Period 13). This drop likely marks the end of the initial spring peak or a temporary lull. However, given the product description, demand should remain relevant throughout the summer. Using a recent average (N=5) for demand captures the higher baseline established in March/April while acknowledging the recent downturn (Avg P9-P13 = 204.8). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand (384) and significant in-transit (1067) inventory, the pipeline is currently well-stocked to handle this level of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility observed in May: Period 13 demand dropped to 60, significantly below the previous 5-period average of ~260, potentially signaling the end of the spring peak or a seasonal shift.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (May 20, 2019), we observe a significant shift in demand for the 'V-neck satin top with a lace trim'. After a peak in March and April where demand averaged ~260, the last two periods (P13, P14) have dropped to 60 and 69 units respectively. This indicates a seasonal transition out of the spring peak. Currently, we have 728 units on-hand and 654 units in-transit (ordered in P11, P12, P13). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the new, lower demand regime, we need to significantly reduce our forecast (mu_hat) to avoid excessive holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this downward trend (averaging the drop to 60/69 with the previous period's 225), and sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current high volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (End of Peak): Weekly demand dropped significantly starting P13, with a 2-period average of ~65 units compared to the previous 10-period average of ~250.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 618800001 (Women's satin top) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a spring peak (Periods 7-11), demand dropped abruptly starting Period 13. The average demand for the last three periods (P13-P15) is 59 units (60, 69, 48), compared to the previous high-demand average of ~260. Current on-hand inventory (832) plus in-transit stock (502) totals 1334 units. This is far in excess of the revised demand forecast (5 * ~60 = 300). Based on the most recent 3 samples, mu_hat (covering L+1=5 periods) should be approximately 300. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) allows the OR backend to recognize the lower demand regime and stop ordering to prevent further holding cost accumulation, as current stock levels are sufficient for many weeks.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (Low): Average weekly demand for Periods 13-15 dropped to ~60 units, down from the spring peak average of ~260 (-77%).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 618800001 (V-neck satin top) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a spring peak where demand averaged ~260 units (Periods 6-12), demand dropped sharply starting in Period 13. Over the last four periods (P13-P16), demand has averaged 56.25 units (60, 69, 48, 48). Current on-hand inventory is 1,086 units, which is extremely high (nearly 20 periods of supply at current demand levels). There is also an in-transit shipment of 200 units (ordered in P13) expected to arrive in Period 17 (P13 + 4 L = P17). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the massive inventory surplus, the goal is to stop ordering and allow inventory to bleed down. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to reflect the new low-demand regime. This low forecast combined with the high current stock will trigger the OR backend to place zero orders (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear regime shift: following a spring peak that saw demand averages around 260 units, demand has plummeted starting in Period 13 (early May). The average demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 52 units, which aligns with the 'End of Peak' seasonal cycle for a 'v-neck satin top with lace trim.' Inventory levels are currently very high at 1,253 units on-hand with zero in-transit, as several large orders placed during the high-demand regime arrived just as demand dropped. The confirmed lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the new low-demand regime, the goal is to stop ordering and allow inventory to deplete. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand environment and use the calculate method for lead time as it is consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (Summer Low) confirmed: Average demand for Periods 13-17 is ~52 units, compared to the spring peak average of ~260 (-80%).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 618800001 (a v-neck satin vest top) has dropped precipitously since mid-May, aligning with the end of the spring retail peak. Current demand over the last 6 periods (P13-P18) has averaged approximately 48 units per week (min 31, max 69), a sharp contrast to the Spring peak of ~260. We currently have an inventory of 1222 units on hand with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods and the current low-demand summer regime, our on-hand stock is sufficient to cover over 20 weeks of demand. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) while we wait for this excess stock to deplete, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=6). This will ensure the OR backend's calculated base stock remains below current inventory levels, resulting in zero units ordered until stock levels normalize.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (Women's satin vest top\u0d3f) is currently in a 'Summer Low' demand regime. Since Period 13 (early May), demand has plummeted from a peak average of ~260 to a low average of ~46 units (P13-P19). Specifically, the last three periods (P17-P19) have shown very low and stable demand of 33, 31, and 36 units respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 1186 units, which at the current burn rate represents over 30 periods of stock. There are no units in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the excessive inventory level, the OR backend's inventory balancing will correctly suppress ordering. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 7 periods (N=7, starting from P13) to capture this new low-demand regime, and use the same N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is a summer-oriented 'V-neck satin top with lace trim', and historical demand data shows a clear regime shift: a high-demand spring peak (Periods 7-12, avg ~260) followed by a significant drop-off starting in Period 13. Over the last 8 periods (P13-P20), the average demand has stabilized at ~50 units per week. Currently, on-hand inventory is 1114 units with no units in transit. Given the current demand rate of ~50, the existing stock covers over 20 weeks of supply. Therefore, the priority is to avoid ordering any additional units to minimize holding costs while the current excess inventory is depleted. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand parameters with N=8 to reflect this lower summer regime (Periods 13-20), and lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is a V-neck satin vest top, which experienced a significant demand spike during the spring (late March to April) but has transitioned into a 'summer low' regime since mid-May (Period 13). Demand over the last 9 periods (P13-P21) has averaged ~52 units per week, far below the spring peak. On-hand inventory is very high at 1042 units with no further units in transit. Given the current demand rate of ~52 units/week, this inventory covers approximately 20 weeks of demand, well beyond the Lead Time (4) + Review Period (1) window. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime and prevent additional ordering while the excess inventory is depleted. I will use a recent_N of 9 for demand and sigma to capture this stable low-demand period since the regime shift.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The SKU (V-neck satin top) is in a summer low-demand regime following a significant spring peak. Looking at the history from Period 13 to Period 22, the average demand is approximately 51 units per period (range 31-72). On-hand inventory is currently 1002 units with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) covers over 19 periods of demand at current rates (1002 / 51 \u2248 19.6). Since holding costs are $1.0/unit and profit is $4.0/unit, the high stock level poses a significant holding cost risk. No new orders have been placed since Period 13. I will continue to set parameters to discourage ordering while the excess inventory is depleted. I'll use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=10 (covering the low-demand period since early May) to reflect the current mean of ~51. The lead time L remains stable at 4.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (Women's Vest Top) is currently in a 'Summer Low' demand regime. Since Period 13 (early May), demand has dropped from a spring peak (avg ~260) to a significantly lower level. For the last 5 periods (P19-P23), demand has averaged 50.2 units. The existing on-hand inventory is 971 units with no units in transit. Given the current average demand, the on-hand stock is sufficient to cover approximately 19 weeks of sales. Since the holding cost is $1.0/unit and profit is $4.0/unit, the OR backend's service level target (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) would naturally suggest a lower base stock than what is currently held. No new orders should be placed until inventory levels are significantly reduced. I am setting parameters based on the most recent 11 periods (P13-P23) to reflect this lower demand regime accurately (avg ~52, std ~16).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a 'V-neck satin top', which saw a significant demand peak during the spring (late March to early May) but has since entered a sustained low-demand regime for the summer. In the last 12 periods (P13-P24), demand has averaged approximately 50.4 units per week, with a consistent range between 31 and 72. On-hand inventory is currently 907 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (sufficient for ~18 weeks of supply). There are no units in transit. Since on-hand inventory already significantly exceeds any reasonable base stock level (estimated at ~250-300 units for a 5-period window), no new orders are required. I will set the parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (using the last 12 periods) to ensure the backend recognizes the overstock situation and maintains a zero-order policy until inventory levels normalize.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Leona V-neck satin top' is in a sustained low-demand regime following its spring peak. Current on-hand inventory is 864 units, while the average demand over the last 13 periods (P13-P25) is approximately 50.7 units per week. With zero units in-transit and a promised lead time of 4 periods, the current stock covers over 17 weeks of demand at the present rate. The goal is to aggressively reduce this inventory to minimize the $1.0/unit/period holding cost, as the current stock level is far in excess of the (L+1) safety stock requirements. No new orders should be placed until inventory levels drop significantly closer to the projected demand for the 5-period horizon (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' to verify stability, though history shows a consistent 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Average demand since Period 13 (mid-May) has maintained a low-volume regime of ~51 units/week, marking the transition from spring peak to summer baseline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The SKU is a 'V-neck satin top', which saw a significant demand peak during the spring (late March to early May) but has since settled into a stable, low-volume summer regime. Demand since Period 13 has averaged approximately 51 units per week. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 834 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (sufficient for over 16 weeks of supply). There are no units in-transit. The promised and actual lead times have consistently been 4 periods. Given the high excess inventory, the OR backend's base-stock logic (even with narrow parameters) will correctly result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize. I will use a recent_N of 14 for demand parameters to capture this post-peak stability (Periods 13-26), providing a mean of ~51 units.

LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (Leona V-neck satin top) is currently in a low-demand summer regime following a significant spring peak. Current date is August 19, 2019. Average weekly demand from Period 13 through Period 27 is approximately 50.5 units. The current on-hand inventory of 786 units is extremely high relative to this demand level, covering over 15 weeks of supply at the current rate. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.00/unit/period) and current stock levels, no new orders are necessary. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (using the last 15 periods from P13-P27) to ensure the OR backend does not trigger a 'cap' order or any replenishment until inventory is significantly depleted.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '618800001' (Womens Satin V-neck top) remains in a low-demand summer regime. Since Period 13 (mid-May), weekly demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the spring peak. The average demand over the last 15 periods (P14-P28) is approximately 50.4 units, with the most recent 5-period average (P24-P28) slightly lower at 50.8 units. The current on-hand inventory is 717 units, with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1 (total protection window = 5 periods), the required inventory to satisfy demand is approximately 250-300 units plus a safety buffer. With 717 units on hand, the system is significantly overstocked relative to current demand trends. This surplus was caused by the large orders placed during the spring peak (P9-P12) arriving just as demand collapsed in May. No new orders are needed. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (using recent_N=15 to capture the post-peak stability) to ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary replenishment while we bleed off the excess inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. The SKU is a 'V-neck satin top with a lace trim', which is a spring/summer item. Since Period 13 (early May), demand has transitioned from a high spring peak (~250 units/week) to a much lower, stable summer/trailing regime (averaging ~51 units/week over the last 17 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 654 units with zero in-transit. At the current demand rate of ~51 units/week, this inventory covers approximately 12-13 weeks of sales, well beyond the 4-period lead time. No new orders are needed. To prevent the OR backend from triggering an unnecessary order due to broad historical averages, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 10-period window to reflect the established low-demand regime, and keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The product is a vest top, which typically sees its peak during spring and early summer. As indicated in the carry-over insights and historical data, demand dropped significantly starting in mid-May (Period 13). Since then, demand has stabilized into a 'summer/post-peak' regime. Over the last 18 periods (P13-P30), the average weekly demand has been approximately 51 units. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 582 units and no units in transit. Given the current demand average of ~51 units, the existing inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 11-12 weeks of demand, which far exceeds the lead time (4) plus review period (1). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set the OR parameters to reflect this low-demand regime using a recent window (last 18 periods) to ensure the base stock calculation remains below the current inventory level, preventing further ordering while the excess stock is depleted.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product is a v-neck satin vest top, which experienced a significant demand peak in Spring (Periods 5-12) and has since stabilized into a much lower 'Summer/Late Summer' regime. Since Period 13, weekly demand has averaged approximately 51 units. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 527 units and zero in-transit. With an average demand of ~51, the current stock covers approximately 10 weeks of demand. Ordering now would only increase holding costs ($1.0/unit) without necessary service level protection, especially as we approach potentially lower demand in autumn/winter for a summer vest. I will set parameters to reflect the recent stable low-demand period (N=15, covering Periods 17-31) and rely on the OR backend's capped policy to prevent further ordering until inventory reduces significantly.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '618800001' (Vest top/Satin top) is currently in a stable low-demand regime following its spring peak. The current date is September 23, 2019. Since Period 13 (May), the demand has averaged approximately 51 units per week, with recent demand showing slight fluctuations but no significant trend shift (the last 5 periods averaged ~58 units). The on-hand inventory is 498 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers nearly 9-10 weeks of sales. Given a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 80% (q = 4/5). Because the on-hand inventory (498) is significantly higher than the required base stock for an (L+1) horizon (approximately 5 * 58 = 290 units), no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent stable demand of the last 20 periods (N=20) to ensure the backend recognizes the lower volume and avoids unnecessary ordering while we burn through existing stock.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The product (a satin V-neck vest top) is transitioning from the summer baseline into the autumn season. Demand has been stable since Period 13 (mid-May), maintaining a low-volume regime with a recent 10-period average (P24-P33) of approximately 54.4 units per week. The inventory on hand (428 units) is still significantly above the level required to cover the (L+1) period demand (estimated at ~272 units based on a base stock calculation with L=4 and mean=54.4). Therefore, no new orders are required. The OR parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime using a recent 10-period window (recent_N=10) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, and the lead time is held at the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019 (Period 35). The SKU is a 'V-neck satin top with a lace trim', which historically saw a massive demand peak in Spring (March-April) before dropping to a stable 'Summer Low' regime from Period 13 onwards. This low-volume regime has persisted through September. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is approximately 50.8 units per week. Currently, there are 403 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we must plan for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~51 units/week, our expected demand for the next 5 periods is ~255 units. Since our on-hand inventory (403) significantly exceeds the required base stock to cover this period (pipeline inventory > base stock), the OR backend will correctly calculate an order of 0 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=22 (since Period 13) to capture the stable post-peak mean and variance, which maintains a cautious buffer against high holding costs while we burn through excess stock. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained low-demand regime (Summer/Autumn baseline) which started around Period 13. Since Period 13, the average weekly demand has been approximately 49 units. We still have significant excess inventory (on-hand: 384) left over from the large orders placed during the spring peak. At the current demand rate of ~49 units/week, the 384 units on hand cover approximately 7-8 weeks of demand, which far exceeds the lead time (4) + review period (1). Consequently, no new orders are necessary. The 'In-transit' is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 0. I will keep mu_hat aligned with the recent low-demand regime (last 20 periods) to ensure the OR backend does not trigger an order while we burn through this excess. L is maintained at the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product (V-neck satin top) has finished its peak spring season and has been in a sustained low-demand summer/autumn regime since Period 13 (mid-May). Recent demand has further decelerated, with the last 5 periods (P32-P36) averaging ~31 units and the last 3 periods (P34-P36) averaging only ~19 units. On-hand inventory is 371 units with 0 in-transit. At the current demand rate, this stock represents over 10-15 weeks of cover, which is more than enough to handle the 4-period lead time plus a cushion. Therefore, I will continue to set parameters that result in zero ordering to minimize holding costs while the excess inventory is depleted. I use recent_N (N=5) for demand to reflect the most recent deceleration and 'calculate' for lead time as the logistics have been stable at 4 periods throughout the game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed Oct 2019: Last 3 periods average ~19 units compared to the summer baseline of ~51 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product is a 'V-neck satin top with lace trim', which typically sees peak demand in spring/summer. Historical data shows an aggressive demand regime shift occurred around Period 35 (early October). The average demand from Period 13 to 34 was ~51 units/week, but the last 3 periods (P35-P37) have dropped significantly to an average of ~18 units/week (19, 13, 21), signaling a transition to a very low winter/off-season baseline. On-hand inventory is CURRENTLY 350 units. With a current demand of ~18/week and a lead time of 4 periods, my total inventory requirement to cover (L+1) periods (5 weeks) is only about 90-100 units. Since I have 350 on hand and no pending in-transit orders, I am significantly overstocked. No new orders are needed. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this most recent drop in demand, which will result in a low base stock and ensure no further orders are placed while I deplete the excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed Oct 2019: Average weekly demand for Periods 35-37 dropped to ~18 units, compared to the summer baseline of ~51 units (-65%).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is a satin vest top, which typically exhibits seasonality (peak in spring/summer, low in winter). Demand has drastically decreased from its spring peak (~260) to a summer baseline (~51), and has recently decelerated further in October to an average of ~20 units (Periods 35-38: 19, 13, 21, 44). The demand of 44 in Period 38 is slightly higher but still within a low-volume winter regime compared to earlier peaks. On-hand inventory is 306 units, which at the current burn rate of ~25-30 units/week, covers over 10 weeks of demand. With a lead time of 4 periods and a total planning horizon (L+1) of 5 periods, the current stock is more than sufficient. No new orders are needed. L is kept at default (4) as it has been consistent. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low-demand winter regime while acknowledging the slight uptick in the most recent period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (Women's Satin V-neck top) is in a low-demand phase following a significant drop in October. Current demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) has averaged 27.6 units, while the very recent 2-period average (P38-P39) suggests a slight uptick to 42.5. We are currently holding 265 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a service level logic where we cover (L+1) periods of demand, we require approximately 5 * 28-40 units (140-200 total). Since our current on-hand inventory is 265, we are already overstocked for the current demand regime. No new orders are needed, and the OR backend's capped policy will correctly result in 0 orders given the high inventory. I am setting parameters to reflect the recent demand stabilization (~28 units/week) observed over the last 5 periods (N=5) to ensure the base stock calculation accurately mirrors the current late-autumn/winter behavior of this sleeveless garment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at low-volume late-autumn levels: Average demand for Periods 35-39 is ~28 units/week, down from the summer baseline of ~51.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a low-volume demand regime following the spring/summer peaks for this women's satin vest top. Demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 39 units over the last 6 periods (P35-P40: 19, 13, 21, 44, 41, 58). While there is a slight upward trend in the last three weeks, the on-hand inventory (207 units) is significantly higher than the projected demand over the next lead time plus review period (5 periods * ~40 units = ~200 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the proximity to the end of the game (6 periods remaining), the primary goal is to deplete existing stock to avoid holding costs. No new orders should be placed. I will use a recent_N (N=6) approach for demand and volatility to capture the most recent late-autumn stabilization while acknowledging the slight uptick.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late-autumn levels: Average demand for Periods 35-40 is ~39 units/week, up slightly from the Oct low but still well below summer/spring levels.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has recently increased from the October low (average ~28 units) to a late-autumn level (average ~58 units over the last 3 periods: P39-41). Period 41 demand specifically hit 73, matching levels seen in summer. This suggests a pre-holiday ramp-up for the 'V-neck satin top'. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition into a higher demand regime. On-hand inventory is 134, and the OR backend's base_stock needs to account for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). At the recent average of ~50-60 units per period, current inventory covers approximately 2-3 periods of demand, so a replenishment is likely needed. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical conclusions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in Nov: Weekly demand increased from late-autumn lows (~28 units) to ~58 units/week (P39-P41), potentially due to holiday seasonality.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked dramatically to 542 units, likely due to Black Friday or holiday sales for this item. This exhausted all on-hand inventory. The current date is Dec 2, 2019, which is the heart of the holiday shopping season. I must account for this significant seasonal pivot. The previous order of 80 units placed in Period 42 is now in-transit and expected in Period 46 (L=4). Using recent_N with N=3 for demand (including the spike) would set mu_hat at ~560, but given it's early December, I expect continue high demand. However, I must be careful not to over-order if the spike was a single-week event. I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand to capture the ramp-up (58, 73, 542) while smoothing extreme outliers slightly, balancing the high demand with the risk of holding too much post-holiday. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed in Period 42: Demand increased from a ~58 unit average to 542 units, marking the start of the winter holiday peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand holiday regime for the 'V-neck satin top'. Demand spiked to 542 in Period 42 and remained elevated at 297 in Period 43. The current date is December 9th, indicating we are in the peak holiday shopping weeks. At the start of Period 44, on-hand inventory is 0, with 592 units in-transit (80 ordered in P42, 512 ordered in P43). The P42 order (80 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 46 (L=4), and the P43 order (512 units) during Period 47. Based on the last two periods, the holiday mean is roughly 420. Setting mu_hat to explicitly cover 5 periods (L+1) at this holiday rate (5 * 420 = 2100) to ensure the OR backend captures the magnitude of the spike, despite the current pipeline of 592 units. However, given the game ends at Period 47, orders placed now (P44) will arrive in P48 (after the game ends). My parameters will primarily influence the safety stock calculation and the order quantity for this period to maximize service level for any remaining demand in P44-P47.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (beginning P42) shows average demand of ~420 units per week, a massive increase from the autumn baseline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the middle of a high-volume holiday demand regime that began around Period 42 (late November). Demand spiked to 542 in Period 42, followed by 297 and 132. The average demand for these last three periods is approximately 324 units. With 'on-hand' inventory at 0 and a significant 'in-transit' pipeline of 1307 units (consisting of orders from P42, P43, and P44), we must ensure the OR backend has an accurate forecast to bridge the gap until these shipments arrive. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, the P42 order (80 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 46. The large P43 and P44 orders (512 and 715 units respectively) will arrive in subsequent periods. I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the recent holiday surge (Avg ~324), and sigma_hat with N=3 to account for the high volatility (standard deviation) seen during this peak. Lead time L is set to 'default' (4) as there is no evidence of deviation from the promised timing in recent history.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P42-P44 is ~324 units, a massive increase from the autumn baseline (approx. 10x). Peak occurred at P42 (542 units).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the winter holiday season (late December). Looking at recent demand: Period 42 was 542, Period 43 was 297, Period 44 was 132, and Period 45 was 475. This gives a 4-period average of 361.5 units. The SKU is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory, but has a large pipeline (1970 units) arriving over the next 4 periods. The first replenishment (ordered P42) is expected to arrive in the next Period (P46 conclusion) based on the lead time of 4. Given we are at the end of December, demand is expected to remain high but potentially transition into post-holiday clearance or a January dip soon. To ensure we cover the remaining peak while accounting for the massive in-transit volume, I am setting mu_hat to 360 units per period (multiplied by L+1 by the OR engine). I'll use explicit sigma to handle the high volatility (std of last 4 periods is ~180).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the midst of a significant winter holiday demand surge for the 'V-neck satin top'. The demand pattern since Period 42 has been: 542, 297, 132, 475, and 271. This is roughly a 10x increase over the late-autumn baseline (~30-40 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 2059 units (ordered between P43 and P46). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 42 order in Period 46. For Period 47 (Dec 30), we are at the tail end of the holiday season and entering the New Year. While demand remains high, it is likely to stabilize or begin a slight post-holiday taper. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new holiday regime, which averages ~343 units per week. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the remaining high-demand window while accounting for the significant in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (starting P42) confirmed with high volatility: 5-period average (P42-P46) is ~343 units/week, with peaks up to 542.
