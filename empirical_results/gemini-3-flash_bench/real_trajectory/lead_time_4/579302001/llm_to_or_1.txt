Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical demand samples for the 'Clarence Push Wireless Farg' (Womens Lingerie) show a notable peak in January 2019 (reaching 150 units on Jan 28) followed by a sharp decline in early February (58 units on Feb 4). This pattern suggests post-holiday or promotional seasonality. Currently, On-hand and In-transit are zero. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the recent drop in demand, using 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will help stabilize the forecast against the outlier peak while still capturing the recent downturn. L is set to 'default' as we have no actual lead time data yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a Women's Lingerie bralette. Looking at historical demand, we saw a clear upward trend in January (96 to 150) followed by a sharp drop on Feb 4th (58) and Feb 11th (28). This suggests a post-holiday/post-event slump or a change in demand regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 166 units in transit from Period 1. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5. To avoid over-ordering during this apparent downturn, I will use a recent_N strategy to capture the lower demand profile. For L, I will stick to the promised lead time (default) as we have no data yet to prove the actual lead time differs. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to weigh the most recent low-demand periods (Feb 11, Feb 4, Jan 28) which average 78.6 units/week, adjusting the forecast down from the earlier January peak.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's bralette. Historical demand data shows a peak in late January (up to 150 units) followed by a sharp drop in early February (58 units). In the last two periods of gameplay (P1 and P2), demand was 28 and 48 respectively. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 and P2 are in transit (166 + 184 = 350 units). Since actual lead time is 4, we don't expect arrivals until Period 5 (concluded in P6). Current on-hand is 0, leading to stockouts. The inventory strategy must cover the lead time (4) + current period = 5 periods. Using the mean of recent demand (P1, P2, and Feb 4th sample: (58+28+48)/3 = 44.6) as the base, \u03bc\u0302 = 5 * 44.6 = 223. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this lower post-peak demand regime for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. L is kept at default (4).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a women's lace bralette. Current on-hand inventory is 0, while 350 units are in-transit (orders from Period 1 and Period 2). Demand has shown a steady increase from 28 to 60 over the last three weeks, though the first week of February showed a low of 58. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we expect the first order (166 units) to arrive in Period 5. Demand is likely entering a stable or slightly increasing phase as we move into March. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the most recent demand trend (last 5 samples including historical data), and L to default as we haven't seen any order conclusions to suggest a lead-time shift yet.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-03-11. The SKU is a 'Non-wired push-up bralette'. We are currently in Period 5. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend from Period 1 to Period 4 (28, 48, 60, 101), despite being out of stock. The pre-game samples (late Jan/early Feb) were much higher (96-150), suggesting the current lower numbers are partially due to stockouts affecting realized demand measurements or seasonality. The promised lead time is 4. The order from Period 1 (166 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 5 (this period), and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible in Period 6). The pipeline currently contains 350 units (166 from P1, 184 from P2). mu_hat needs to account for (L+1=5) periods. Given the sharp increase to 101 in P4 and the historical peak of 150, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the upward trajectory of the demand during the active game periods while acknowledging the high samples from just before the game started.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's bralette. Looking at the history, the Period 1 order (166 units) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. In-transit inventory stands at 184 units (from Period 2), which is expected to arrive in Period 6 based on L=4. Demand history (samples + game history) shows: 96, 105, 130, 150, 58, 28, 48, 60, 101, 75. There was a significant drop in demand starting around Feb 4 (Period 0 equivalent) until March 4, possibly following a post-holiday or post-promotion dip, but demand has started increasing again (60, 101, 75). Setting N=5 for mu_hat captures this recent recovery while discounting the very high January values. L is set to default (4) as the first shipment arrived exactly as promised.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand history shows a seasonal increase starting in January (96-150 range), a sharp dip in early February (58), and a recovery through late February and March (48, 60, 101, 75, 91). The average demand over the last 5 weeks is approximately 75 units. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1 and P2 in periods 5 and 6 respectively. Current on-hand is 184 and in-transit is 37 (from P6 order). Total pipeline is 221. With L=4, we need coverage for (L+1)=5 periods. 5 * 75 = 375 units needed. The OR backend uses profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) to target a 50% service level (z=0). Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the post-February recovery trend. Using default for L as it matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand for this bralette peaked in late January (up to 150) and has since stabilized. The last 4 periods (Periods 4-7) show demand of 101, 75, 91, and 97, averaging approximately 91 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and conclude messages from Periods 5 and 6 confirm the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (the median), meaning our base stock should target the expected demand over the (L+1) = 5 period risk window. With 87 units on hand and 148 in transit (from Periods 6 and 7), our current pipeline is 235 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 91/unit) and verify that (1+L) * 91 = 455 units is the target safety stock. Given the OR backend's capping and calculation logic, providing the recent demand statistics is the most robust approach. No shipments are currently overdue (P6 order of 37 is expected in P10; P7 order of 111 is expected in P11).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 91 units/week following early Feb dip; Actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods via P5 and P6 arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's lingerie item (bralette). Demand has stabilized after an initial late-January surge and a early-February dip, with the last three periods showing 91, 97, and 91 units respectively (avg ~93). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant stockout in Period 8 (lost 4 units of demand). In-transit inventory is 258 units, consisting of orders from Period 6 (37), Period 7 (111), and Period 8 (110). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on Period 5 and 6 conclusions. The Period 6 order (37 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 9, which will help alleviate the stockout but is likely insufficient for the full demand of Period 10. To recover, I will set mu_hat based on the stable demand of the last 4 periods (Periods 5-8 average: 88.5) and choose the confirmed lead time L=4. This results in a coverage requirement of (1+L)=5 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), on-hand inventory is 0 due to an stockout starting in Period 8. The in-transit pipeline (363 units) consists of orders from P6 (37), P7 (111), P8 (110), and P9 (105). Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods (seen in P5 and P6 arrivals), the P6 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of the current period (P10) and become visible in the next decision cycle. Previous demand samples show a regime shift after the early Feb dip; the last 4 periods average 86.75 units/week (91, 97, 91, 68). The dip to 68 in P9 might be incidental or due to stockout visibility, so I will use a recent_N (N=4) to capture the current stable demand level while accounting for the confirmed lead time of 4. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 0.50, which the OR backend will target via the base stock calculation.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019-04-22). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on sightings in Period 5, 6, and 10. Currently, we have 0 units on-hand and 397 in-transit. An order of 111 units placed in Period 7 is expected to arrive during Period 11 (visible in P12), but we are currently stock-out. Demand has shown a downward trend in the last three weeks (91, 68, 49), which might be post-Easter seasonality. However, earlier demand stabilized around 90. To avoid over-ordering during a potential dip but maintaining service levels for the recovery, I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the recent deceleration while keeping some historical weight. Sigma will also use recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility during this period of stock-outs and shifting demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand for this lace bralette showed a peak in January/February, followed by a stabilization around 91 units/week (Periods 6-8). However, the last three periods (9, 10, 11) have seen a downward trend with demand at 68, 49, and 47 units respectively, suggesting a seasonal decline moving out of spring. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 10 and 11. Currently, there are 64 units on-hand and 286 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 8, 9, and 10). With a promised lead time of 4, we need coverage for 5 periods (L+1). Given the recent demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the deceleration while acknowledging the slightly higher demand in Period 8. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will balance the high pipeline against this lower demand forecast to prevent overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average weekly demand decreased from approx 91 to 55 (-40%) during April.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/6. Reviewing demand history, there was a significant drop in demand throughout April (averaging ~55 units), but Period 12 showed a sudden spike to 104 units. Looking at the pre-April history, demand averaged ~91. The product (Womens Lingerie) often sees volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed (P6, P7, and P8 orders arrived exactly at L=4). Pipeline inventory is 176 (orders from P9 and P10) and on-hand is 70. Since the recent demand spike in P12 may indicate a return to previous levels (~90s) or just a single-period outlier, I will use a balanced window of the last 4 periods (P9-P12) to calculate mu_hat, which covers the low-demand month and the recent spike. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same window to capture this recent increase in volatility. L is set to default as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Clarence Push Wireless Farg' (Lingerie) is currently in Period 14 (mid-May). Recent demand history (Periods 12-13) shows a recovery to 100-104 units per week, invalidating the previous April 'regime shift' of 55 units/week mentioned in CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS. The average demand of the last 4 weeks (Periods 10-13) is exactly 75, but the last two weeks suggest a stronger trend. Setting mu_hat to cover the lead time (L=4) plus current period (1+L=5) using recent_N=4 to reflect this recent uptick while acknowledging volatility. Sigma_hat is calculated similarly. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (validated by concurrent arrivals from P6-P9). On-hand is 75 with 160 in-transit (P10: 71, P13: 89), which aligns with the demand target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Demand recovered from April lows (~50) to ~100 units/week in May.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 12 (May), with actual weekly demand averaging 102 units over the last three weeks (P12-P14: 104, 100, 104). This contrasts with the lower April demand (~55 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in P10 through P14. Currently, we have 42 units on-hand and 216 units in-transit (P13 order of 89 and P14 order of 127). Given L=4, my parameters must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At ~100 units/week, the target inventory (base stock) should be around 500 units. My pipeline (42 + 216 = 258) is currently under-provisioned for this new demand level. I will use recent_N=3 to capture the current May demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for 100+ units per week while maintaining service levels against the observed volatility in this period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 579302001 has stabilized in a new regime since Period 12, averaging approximately 93.5 units per week (periods 12-14 were around 100, while period 15 dipped to 66). I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture the current post-April recovery level while acknowledging the latest fluctuation. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the completion of all orders from Period 1 through Period 10, so I will stick with the promised L. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 323 units in transit (ordered in P13, P14, and P15). With an expected arrival in the current period (P16) from the P12 order not yet visible (but calculated in the arrival resolution phase), the OR backend will use these parameters to determine the appropriate base stock (Target Service Level = 0.5 given Profit=Holding=$1.0) and order size to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd. Historical demand for this bralette shows stabilization around 100+ units during May, with a recent spike to 139 in Period 16, though stockouts prevented sales. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' of 447 units covers orders from Periods 13 to 16. Specifically, the order of 89 units from Period 13 is expected to arrive this period (P17), the 127 units from P14 in P18, the 107 units from P15 in P19, and the 124 units from P16 in P20. With on-hand at 0, we are currently in a stockout state until the P13 shipment arrives. To capture the recent recovery and peak demand (May-June), I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (averaging P12-P16 demand: 104, 100, 104, 66, 139 = ~103/week). This targets a base stock that accounts for the 5-week lead+review cycle (approx 515 units). Setting L to 'calculate' to maintain the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Weekly demand increased to ~139 units as summer season approaches.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. We are observing a significant demand surge associated with the summer season and likely promotional activities for this lingerie SKU (139 and 191 in the last two periods). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 424 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 13 order in Period 17 conclude. We are entering a higher demand regime (avg ~165 over the last two weeks). To calculate mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to capture this upward shift while tempering the extreme spike from last period (191) to avoid over-ordering as we reach the peak. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility observed during this transition. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Weekly demand surged from ~100 to an average of ~165 (reaching 191 in P17) as summer peak season began.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019, which is in the middle of the summer peak season for lingerie/bralettes. Demand has surged significantly; the last three valid samples (P16, P17, P18) show demand levels of 139, 191, and 129 respectively, averaging approximately 153 units per week. The carry-over insights confirm this upward shift. However, supply chain execution is struggling to keep up with this demand shift: we are currently at zero on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods (P15, P17, P18). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by P13 and P14 arrivals. To address the significant increase in demand and prevent further lost sales during the high-demand summer months, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture the current high-demand regime (153 * (1+4) = 765). Sigma_hat is also updated using the same window to account for the increased volatility observed during this peak. This will raise the base stock level to better compete with the holding cost vs stockout risk, especially given that profit and holding cost are equal (optimal service level is 50%, but base stock logic includes cushions).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand confirmed: P16-P18 average demand at 153 units/week compared to previous regime of ~100 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the summer peak season for the 'Clarence Push Wireless Farg' (Womens Lingerie/Bralette). Demand since Period 16 has significantly shifted upward, with recent observations being 139, 191, 129, and 139. The average demand over these last 4 periods is approximately 150 units. We are currently facing stockouts with 0 on-hand inventory, although we saw an arrival of 107 units in Period 19. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with recent arrivals (Period 15's order arrived in Period 19). For parameters: L is set to calculated as lead times are stable at 4. mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the summer demand regime (approx 150 * 5 = 750). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility seen during this peak period. This ensures the OR backend attempts to cover the pipeline needs while accounting for the current demand surge.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019, which is the heart of the summer retail season for women's lingerie (bras/bralettes). Demand has clearly entered a higher regime compared to the spring. Looking at the last 5 weeks (Periods 16-20), demand has been 139, 191, 129, 139, and 108. The mean of these 5 samples is 141.2. The 'Summer peak' insight captured in Period 19 is holding, though the most recent data point (P20: 108) suggests a slight softening or variance from the peak of 191. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 16 order in Period 20. On-hand inventory is very low (16), but the pipeline is substanial (624 units) following large orders in P18/P19. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current summer demand level while acknowledging the volatility with sigma_hat also set to recent_N=5.

The demand in Period 21 reached 188 units, following a volatile but high-average pattern (P17: 191, P18: 129, P19: 139, P20: 108). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is approximately 151 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival in P21 of the order from P17). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a significant pipeline of 624 units. However, given the high stockout frequency (ending inventory 0 in 4 of the last 5 periods), the OR parameters must be set to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 weeks of high demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer demand volatility and mean, ensuring the system recovers from the current stockout state without over-ordering excessively against the existing pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is July 15, 2019, which is squarely in the summer season for this bralette SKU. Demand has remained strong over the last 6 periods (P17-P22), with an average of approximately 151 units per week (min 108, max 191). The most recent demand (P21: 188, P22: 150) indicates the peak is sustained. On-hand inventory is low (60 units) and in-transit inventory (545 units) is significant, but we must maintain a high service level to capture this seasonal demand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the summer regime average (approx 151 * 5 = 755), and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current high-demand environment while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/22, in the middle of the summer peak season for the bralette (SKU 579302001). Historically, demand surged in mid-June and has remained elevated. Recent demand samples show a high variance (P21: 188, P22: 150, P23: 102). Taking the average of the last 8 periods (since the seasonal shift in late May/early June) gives approximately 139 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 166 and 487 in-transit, we are well-positioned but must maintain safety stock to handle the high variance observed in summer demand (102 to 191 units). I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer regime levels and volatility while ensuring the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P16 onwards) maintains an average of ~139 units/week with significant volatility (std dev ~34), likely peaking through July/early August.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is the tail end of the summer season for this bralette SKU. Demand has remained strong but volatile since Period 16 (the start of the summer regime). The average demand over the last 9 periods (P16-P24) is approximately 140 units/week. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P20 order arrived in P24). As we approach August, demand is expected to remain in this summer regime before potentially tapering late in the month. Current inventory position is healthy: 189 units on-hand plus 411 in-transit. The in-transit units consist of orders from P21 (66), P22 (131), P23 (150), and P24 (64). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which corresponds to targeting the mean demand. I will use a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer regime's average and volatility accurately.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/5. The SKU '579302001' is a lace bralette, which typically sees peak demand during late spring and summer. Historical data shows a sustained summer demand regime starting around Period 16. In the most recent periods (P23-P25), demand has begun to cool off: 102, 117, 71 (average ~97) compared to the mid-summer peak average of ~139. This suggests the summer peak is tapering as we move into August. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P21-P25). Pipelines are currently healthy at 447 units against an on-hand inventory of 184. To avoid overstocking as the season ends, I will use a recent_N (N=8) to capture the current descending trend while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the residual summer demand. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio of 0.5, targeting the median of the demand distribution.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Weekly demand decreasing from summer peak (~139) to approximately 95 units/week as of early August, signaling the end of the summer season.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 27 (early August). The carry-over insights and recent demand history indicate completion of the summer peak season. Demand in the last four periods (P23-P26) was 102, 117, 71, and 114, averaging approximately 101 units per week. This aligns with the previous insight that demand is returning to a post-summer level of around 95-100 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as evidenced by the arrival of the P22 order in P26. With 201 units on hand and 316 in transit, we are currently overstocked relative to the new lower demand regime (517 total units vs ~500 units needed for the 5-period risk window). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable lead time and use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this downward shift to ~101 units/week while maintaining moderate sigma to handle the observed variance in this transition period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Clarence Push Wireless Bralette has entered a more volatile phase following the high summer season. While the Period 26 insight suggested a drop to ~95 units/week, Period 27 saw a sharp spike to 196 units. This suggests that while we are post-peak, volatility remains high (standard deviation approx 47 units over the last 5 periods). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is 120 units, while the last 3 periods average 127 units. Given the transition from summer (high demand) to late August, I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture this recent variance while stabilizing for the unexpected P27 spike. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (observed across almost all history). On-hand inventory is 155 with 166 in-transit; the OR backend should maintain safety stock to handle the observed spikes while managing the risk of inventory carry-over as we enter the autumn season.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late August (Period 27 demand: 196) despite earlier signs of end-of-summer cooling.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-08-26. We are exiting the summer peak for this lingerie SKU, though recent demand remains volatile (P27: 196, P28: 168). The 'Carry-over insights' noted a cooling trend earlier, but the last two periods suggest a secondary peak or late-summer clearance effect. The Lead Time is stable at 4 periods. With 51 units on hand and 299 in transit, we must ensure we don't over-order if demand reverts to the non-summer average (approx 100). However, given the sustained higher demand over the last 3 periods (avg ~159), I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this current trend while the OR backend's inventory cap prevents excessive over-ordering. This balances the risk of stockouts during this high-demand tail against the holding cost of units that might not sell as autumn approaches.

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand rebound: P27-P28 demand averaged 182 units, significantly higher than the early August cooling trend of ~95 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Clarence Push Wireless Bralette has shown significant volatility in late August and early September. While Period 26 suggested a cooling trend (95 units/week), Periods 27 and 28 spiked significantly (196 and 168), followed by 111 in Period 29. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is approximately 147 units. Given the transition from summer into September, I am using a recent window (N=4) to capture this late-season surge while remaining responsive to potential cooling. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 42 and 426 units in-transit (orders from P26-P29), the parameters aim to maintain a high service level for the (L+1) horizon while managing the risk of overstocking if demand returns to the ~100 range.

Carry-over insight: Late-August/Early-September demand volatility: P26-P29 demand averaged 147 units/week, contradicting the previous cooling expectation of 95 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the demand for the Clarence Push Wireless Bralette has shown significant volatility. While there was a summer peak and a subsequent late-August rebound (P27-P28 demand averaged 182), the most recent demand in Period 30 dropped back to 89 units. In the lingerie category, early September often sees a mix of post-summer clearance and 'back-to-school/university' shopping, leading to high variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (verified through P25). My current inventory is 0 on-hand with a large pipeline of 642 units. To prevent over-ordering while accounting for the recent high-demand spikes (P27-P28), I will use the mean demand from the last 5 periods (P26-P30), which is approximately 135.6 units/week. This balances the high August demand with the recent September cooling. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility observed in late summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in late August/early September; P26-P30 demand mean is 135.6 units/week compared to the previous cooling expectation of 95 units/week.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are seeing continued high demand variance and potential stockouts due to a combination of high late-August demand (avg 182 units in P27-P28) and recent stock outs in P30 and P31. While demand dropped to 72 in P31, it's likely constrained by zero on-hand inventory. Historically, the lead time has been stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 678 units, including large orders from P28 (197), P29 (229), and P30 (216), which are expected to arrive in P32, P33, and P34 respectively. These arrivals will satisfy the current backlog and replenish on-hand stock. To capture the recent volatile demand regime effectively, I will use recent_N with N=9 (covering Period 23 to 31) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which reflects the post-summer peak and the unexpected late-August surge. This N=9 period average is approximately 117 units/week, providing a safer buffer than the earlier cooling estimate of 95 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P23-P31 shows a mean of ~117 units/week with persistent high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 43), as the cooling trend expected in early August was disrupted by a late-August surge.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Clarence Push Wireless Farg' (a lace bralette) has entered a post-summer cooling phase. Demand in Period 32 was 62 units, continuing a decelerating trend from the high volatility seen in August (P27/P28 averaged 182 units). Over the last five periods (P28-P32), demand has averaged 100.4 units, but the last three periods (P30-P32) show a clearer downward trend (89, 72, 62). I will set mu_hat to a recent average of 5 periods (N=5) to capture this cooling while respecting recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P28 order arrived in P32), and no orders from P26-P27 have arrived yet\u2014these appear to be lost shipments as they are now at or past the 4-period mark without a 'conclude' message (P28 arrived while P26/27 did not). I will adjust the pipeline inventory strategy by using recent_N for both demand and volatility to provide a buffer against the current stockout risks posed by these missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Potential lost shipments: Orders from Period 26 and Period 27 have not arrived as of Period 32 conclusion, despite the Period 28 order arriving on time (lead_time=4). Demand cooling confirmed: P30-P32 demand shows a steady decline (89, 72, 62) following the late-August peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Clarence Push Wireless Bra has stabilized around a lower average following the summer peak and the volatile late-August rebound. Over the last four periods (P30-P33), weekly demand has been 89, 72, 62, and 95, averaging approximately 80 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect this cooling trend. Standard deviation in this recent window is approximately 15. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods according to the most recent arrival (P29 order arrived at P33). Regarding the missing shipments from Period 26 and Period 27 (ordered 0 units in both cases), there were no physical units to arrive, so no conclude messages were expected for those specific periods' orders; the pipeline inventory is correctly accounted for. With 269 units on-hand and 252 in-transit, the inventory position is high relative to the current demand regime (~80 units/week), so the OR backend will likely minimize new orders to reduce holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization (P30-P33): Average weekly demand decreased to ~80 units (from ~117 in the volatile P23-P31 period).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Clarence Push Wireless Bra has entered a post-summer stabilization phase. Following the volatile late-August spikes (up to 196 units), demand for the last five periods (P30-P34) has averaged 77.6 units/week (89, 72, 62, 95, 66), which aligns with the cooling trend identified in previous insights. On-hand inventory is currently high (419 units) due to the arrival of several large orders placed during the August volatility (specifically orders from P28, P29, and P30). With an expected lead time of 4 periods and a projected weekly demand of ~80 units, the current on-hand plus in-transit stock (419 + 36 = 455) covers approximately 5.7 weeks of demand, which is sufficient. The orders from Period 26 and 27 are now 8 and 7 periods old respectively and are likely lost, so they are excluded from the pipeline calculation. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current 78 units/week average, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent reduction in volatility compared to the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmation: Orders from Period 26 and Period 27 did not arrive by Period 34 (3-4 periods past promised lead time) and are considered lost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Clarence Push Wireless Bralette has entered a post-summer stabilization phase. Following high volatility in August and early September, demand has significantly cooled over the last six periods (P30-P35), with recent weekly demand figures of 89, 72, 62, 95, 66, and 55. This results in a smoothed demand average of approximately 73 units per week for this period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 400 units, which is extremely high given the current demand regime. With an expected lead time of 4 periods, coverage for (L+1)=5 periods at 73 units/week requires only ~365 units. Since on-hand inventory (400) already exceeds the required base stock and there is zero in-transit inventory (confirming previous losses from P26-P27 have been accounted for and subsequent orders have arrived), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 samples to reflect this recent cooling trend and maintain a standard sigma_hat to manage lingering volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization: Demand from P30-P35 has averaged ~73 units/week, down from the volatile P23-P31 period (~117 units/week).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/10/21. Demand has significantly cooled following the summer peak and the volatile late-August rebound. Over the last 7 periods (P30-P36), demand has averaged approximately 68 units/week (89, 72, 62, 95, 66, 55, 37), with a clear downward trend towards late October. Current on-hand inventory is 363 units, which at the current demand rate covers more than 5 weeks of demand. In-transit inventory is 0, as all recent orders (up to P31) have either arrived or were confirmed lost (P26, P27). Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (covering L+1 periods) and the current inventory (363) already exceeds the likely required base stock for a 5-period horizon (approx 5 * 68 = 340), the system should continue to avoid ordering. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime and reflect the reduced volatility in sigma_hat. The lead time L remains at the promised 4 periods as recent arrivals (P28-P31) have returned to the standard 4-period schedule.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: Demand regime from P30-P36 has stabilized at an average of ~68 units/week, a 50% reduction from the summer peak (~139) and late-August volatility (~147).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 579302001 has entered a clear post-summer cooling phase. Since Period 30, demand has consistently declined and remained low, with the last two periods showing minimal demand (37 and 39 units). The current average demand for this regime (P30-P37) is approximately 61.6 units per week. On-hand inventory is currently very high (324 units), which covers over 5 periods of forecasted demand at the current average. Two shipments (from P26 and P27) are confirmed lost, but later shipments arrived on time with a lead time of 4. Given the high on-hand inventory and the low demand trend, the focus is on avoiding excess holding costs while maintaining a buffer for the current lower demand level. I will use a recent_N (N=8) to capture the current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed: Weekly demand from P30-P37 has averaged 61.6 units, reflecting a persistent cooling trend after the summer peak and late-August volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-258.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Clarence Push Wireless Bra has clearly transitioned into a stable, late-autumn cooling phase. The most recent demand samples from Period 30 to Period 38 (89, 72, 62, 95, 66, 55, 37, 39, 33) show a definitive downward trend and stabilization at a lower level compared to the summer and early autumn volatility. Specifically, the last four periods have averaged approximately 36 units per week. With an on-hand inventory of 291 units and no units in transit, the current stock is sufficient to cover over 8 weeks of demand at the current rate (291 / 36 \u2248 8.08), which exceeds the (L+1) requirement for a 4-period lead time. No new orders have been placed since Period 31, and none are needed now. I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the period since the last major demand peak in P29) to accurately reflect this lower regime and prevent the OR backend from over-ordering based on older summer data. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: Weekly demand from P35-P38 has stabilized at an average of 41 units (33, 39, 37, 55), significantly lower than the P30-P34 average of 77 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 579302001 has entered a stable post-summer cooling phase. Over the last five periods (P35-P39), average demand has been approximately 39.4 units per week (33, 39, 37, 55, 33), significantly lower than the summer peak and the volatile late-August period. Current on-hand inventory is 258 units, which is exceptionally high relative to the current demand regime. With 14 units currently in transit and a lead time of 4 periods, the existing inventory levels (258 on-hand + 14 in-transit = 272 total pipeline) cover approximately 7 weeks of demand at the current rate (~39 units/week). No additional ordering is required as the system needs to burn through the excess stock to minimize holding costs. I am setting parameters based on the most recent 5-period regime (P35-P39) to reflect this stabilized low-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization (P35-P39): Average weekly demand has settled at 39.4 units, representing a stable low-demand regime compared to previous volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 579302001 has entered a stable low-demand regime since late October (Period 35). Over the last 6 periods (P35-P40), weekly demand has averaged 37.5 units (55, 37, 39, 33, 33, 28), with the most recent two periods dropping even further to ~30 units. We are currently significantly overstocked with 230 units on-hand, which covers over 6 weeks of demand at current rates, while the target base stock (calculated as ~37.5 * 5 \u2248 188 units) is lower than our current inventory. Consequently, the OR backend should naturally stop ordering. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized post-summer low-demand environment (approximately 37.5 units/week). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent completed shipments (P28-P31).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer low-demand regime confirmed: P35-P40 demand averaged 37.5 units/week, down from the P30-P34 average of 77 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, and the demand for this product (bralette/women's lingerie) has settled into a significant low-demand post-summer regime. Demand over the last 7 periods (P35-P41) has been extremely stable, averaging 36.3 units/week with low volatility (standard deviation ~9.5). There are currently 201 units on hand, which is more than enough to cover the remaining 6 periods of the game at the current consumption rate (~6 weeks * 36.3 units = 217 units; game ends at Period 47). The order placed in Period 39 (14 units) is still in transit and expected in Period 43. Given the aim to maximize profit R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory, and noting that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the priority is reducing ending inventory to avoid holding costs that exceed profit gains. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized low-demand regime. This will calculated a base stock that is likely lower than current on-hand + in-transit, resulting in zero additional orders to minimize inventory bloat before the game's end.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 579302001 (Women's Lingerie) reached a significant low post-summer, stabilizing at a mean of approximately 37.5 units/week (P35-P40). However, Period 42 showed a demand spike to 68 units, which likely coincides with the start of holiday shopping/Black Friday (late November). Given the date is now Dec 2, we are in the peak holiday season. Historical data from early 2019 showed demand ranging from 96 to 150 in January, suggesting a higher year-end/new-year baseline. On-hand inventory is 133, which is sufficient for only ~2-3 periods if demand remains elevated. To prevent stockouts during the December shopping period, I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the post-summer low mean (approx 40) but relying on the OR backend's safety stock (sigma_hat) to handle the recent spike in volatility. I am maintaining the promised lead time of 4 periods, as arrivals have recently been consistent with this timing.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand increased to 68 units (approx 80% higher than the previous 6-week average of 37.5), signaling the start of the year-end retail season.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering the peak December holiday season. Demand in Period 42 was 68 units and Period 43 was 98 units, confirming a sharp holiday spike compared to the November average of ~30. Given the date (Dec 9), we expect demand to remain high or increase further over the next 2-3 weeks before the post-Christmas drop. The current on-hand inventory (49) is insufficient to cover the lead time + review period demand (L+1 = 5 weeks). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts during the holiday peak, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 450 (90 units/week * 5 weeks), reflecting the recent upward trend and anticipated holiday volume. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for higher volatility during peak shopping periods. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock high enough to satisfy the seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Weekly demand increased from ~30 in early Nov to 68 (P42) and 98 (P43), a ~3x increase signaling the peak December shopping season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December shopping season for this women's lingerie SKU. Period 44 saw a massive demand surge to 232 units, following 98 in P43 and 68 in P42. This confirms the holiday spike noted in the Carry-Over Insights. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) with 204 units in-transit. The in-transit units include orders from P43 (55 units) and P44 (149 units), which are expected in P47 and P48 respectively, assuming the standard 4-period lead time. Given that demand jumped from ~30-40 to over 200, I am shifting mu_hat to an explicit forecast to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that can handle continued high volatility and potential stockouts during this final peak. I'll use a 3nd-period demand average (P42-P44) of approximately 133 units/week as the new mu baseline for the (L+1) period. Sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value to account for the extreme variance observed during this transition from low-demand to holiday peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Extreme holiday peak demand confirmed: Period 44 demand reached 232 units, a significant jump from Period 43 (98) and Period 42 (68).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the year-end holiday season (late December). Demand skyrocketed from ~30 units in early November to a massive peak of 232 in Period 44 and 176 in Period 45. The on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and there are 470 units in-transit. Based on the holiday schedule, Demand is expected to remain high through Period 47 before dropping sharply in January. I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the shift from the low-demand regime to the holiday spike (Periods 42-45: 68, 98, 232, 176; avg ~143.5). Given the extreme volatility and the stockout situation, I am using an 'explicit' sigma_hat set to 80 to ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers the remaining peak demand period and accounts for the 4-period lead time. The goal is to replenishment enough to clear the current stockout while recognizing the game ends at Period 47.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Peak confirmed: P44-P45 demand averaged 204 units, compared to the early Dec spike of ~83 units (P42-P43). Inventory is currently depleted due to this surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the late-December holiday peak (Period 47: Dec 30, 2019). Demand surged from ~30 units to a peak of 232 in Period 44, followed by 176 and 151 in Periods 45 and 46. On-hand inventory is depleted (0 units). A large pipeline of 673 units is in transit, reflecting aggressive ordering in response to the holiday spike (orders of 149, 266, and 203 in P44-P46). Given it is now Dec 30, demand is expected to begin a post-holiday decline as the shopping season concludes. I will use a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the average of the surge (P42-P46: 68, 98, 232, 176, 151; Mean: ~145) while transitioning into the post-peak phase. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods based on recent history.
