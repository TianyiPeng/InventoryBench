Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 688105002 (Mini Bea Denim Skirt). Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 0 -> 24 -> 125 -> 150 -> 153. This suggests a ramp-up phase entering the spring season, consistent with when denim skirts would begin trending up in February/March. Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are in an active growth phase, using all historical samples (including the initial zeros/low numbers) would underestimate future demand across the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent stability (125, 150, 153) and avoid the early ramp-up values. L is set to default (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat target the last 3 periods to maintain high service levels while demand stabilizes.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a denim mini skirt, which typically sees rising demand in early spring. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 99 units, while the pre-game historical samples for the last few weeks were 125, 150, and 153. The initial stock was 0, leading to 99 lost sales in Period 1. There are 168 units in transit (ordered in Period 1). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning this shipment is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). I will use the recent historical demand (last 4 samples: 125, 150, 153, 99) to project forward. Average demand of these is 131.75. Given the L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. mu_hat = 5 * 131.75 = 658.75. Sigma_hat is calculated based on these recent samples to maintain a buffer for transition into spring.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. In periods 1 and 2, we had zero on-hand inventory and were unable to satisfy demand (99 and 102 units respectively). There are 342 units in transit (168 ordered in P1, 174 ordered in P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order from P1 is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in P6. The product is a mini denim skirt, and demand is currently averaging around 100 units/period since the start of February (recent samples: 153, 99, 102). Based on the 5 pre-game samples and 2 game samples, there is a clear upward trend from late January. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this higher demand regime (approx 100-150 units) to ensure mu_hat reflects current velocity while we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a denim mini skirt, which typically sees increased demand as spring approaches. Historical demand samples (up to Feb 4) showed a clear upward trend (0 to 153), and recent demand in Periods 1-3 remains high (99, 102, 75). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a significant amount in transit (517 units). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have not yet reached 4 periods (we are at Period 4 decision, orders from P1 should arrive in P5 at the earliest according to the 'Lead Time Definition'), we have no confirmed arrivals to calculate actual lead time. I will maintain L=4. Demand appears to have stabilized after the initial ramp-up. I will use the last 5 samples (P1-P3 plus the last two pre-game samples) to estimate mean demand, which averages approximately 116 units per period. With L=4, mu_hat = (1+L) * 116 = 580. Sigma_hat will be estimated using recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock for a product with zero inventory.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim mini skirt, which enters peak seasonality in spring. Current date is March 11th. Demand historicals (24, 125, 150, 153) and game history demands (99, 102, 75, 82) show a significant ramp-up from January into February/March, though the game demand is slightly lower than the seed data. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (168 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5 conclude (visible in Period 6 START). Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 580. Since we have not yet observed a full lead-time cycle (Period 1 order arrives in Period 5 resolution), we stick to the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=5 (including seed data + game data) to capture the elevated spring demand level while balancing the slightly lower recent game demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current volatility in the active season.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a denim mini skirt, which typically sees higher demand as spring starts. Looking at the history, demand has been consistent: P1=99, P2=102, P3=75, P4=82, P5=69. The mean demand across these 5 periods is 85.4. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The P1 order of 168 units arrived in P5 (exact lead time of 4), confirming the promised lead time holds. Current on-hand is 99, with 412 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4). Since profitability and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, aiming for the median. Given the seasonality of spring clothes in March, I will use recent history (N=5) for demand and lead time to capture the current regime while we watch for a spring surge.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a denim mini skirt, which typically sees rising demand as spring progresses toward summer. Looking at recent demand: P1: 99, P2: 102, P3: 75, P4: 82, P5: 69, P6: 53. While current weekly demand is trending downward (avg ~75), we must anticipate the seasonal shift for late March/April. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Currently, On-hand is 220 and In-transit is 238 (from P3 and P4 orders), totaling a pipeline of 458. With L=4, the OR backend covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Given the product type and seasonality reaching April, I will use a conservative recent window (last 4 periods) for mean demand to stabilize against the initial P1-P2 spikes, but set L=4 to match the confirmed physical lead time. This will ensure the backend maintains a base stock of roughly 5 * 70 = 350 units plus safety stock, which is currently well-covered by the 458 units in the system, likely leading to a small or zero order this period to avoid overstocking while holding costs equal profits.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a denim mini skirt, which is entering its peak spring/summer season. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 7 (273 units), rising sharply from the previous average of ~80. This aligns with seasonal transitions in April. Regarding supply, the promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7. Currently, we have 122 units on hand and 63 in-transit (ordered in Period 4 and expected to arrive this period). However, given the massive demand spike to 273 units last week, the pipeline (122 + 63 = 185) is insufficient to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) if this new demand level persists or grows. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent upward trend while acknowledging the high variance, and set sigma_hat explicitly high to ensure the OR backend maintains a higher service level during this seasonal ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 7: Demand spiked 230% (from ~80 to 273) coinciding with the start of April/Spring season.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/04/08). This product is a 'Mini Bea Skirt', which is highly seasonal for the Spring/Summer transition. A confirmed demand regime shift occurred at Period 7 (Date: 2019/3/25), with demand jumping from an average of ~80 to current levels (~273 in P7, ~126 in P8). Lead time is stable at 4 periods as seen in the last 4 arrival conclusions. With on-hand inventory at 59 and a lead time of 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). The 316 units ordered in P8 (In-transit) are expected to arrive in P12. The historical samples show a peak of 153 in February, and current demand is fluctuating as Spring begins. I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current Spring regime for demand mean and volatility, while keeping the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-April, which corresponds to the start of the spring/summer season for the 'Skirt Mini Bea'. A clear demand regime shift was detected starting in Period 7 (Date: 2019/3/25), with demand jumping from an average of ~80 to spikes over 270 (Avg since P7 is ~155 despite the P9 dip). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. The next arrival (ordered Period 8) is expected in Period 12 (4 periods later). We must set parameters to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat specifically targets the recent higher seasonal demand (avg ~155/week) to ensure the base stock is high enough to satisfy upcoming spring demand, while L remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019/04/22). The product is a denim mini skirt, which enters peak seasonality in spring (April/May). Recent demand history shows a significant but volatile regime shift: Period 7 (273), Period 8 (126), Period 9 (66), and Period 10 (88). The spike in Period 7 was likely a seasonal launch peak, with demand now stabilizing at a higher level than the pre-April average (~85). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this post-shift behavior, which averages ~138 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 8 (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived with exactly 4 periods lead time). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 775 units in transit (ordered in Periods 8, 9, and 10). The next arrival (from the P8 order of 316 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 12 and be visible in Period 13. My parameters L=4 and mu_hat based on the last 4 periods will prompt the OR engine to maintain a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (approx 690 units), accounting for the pipeline and ensuring stock levels recover as shipments arrive.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (late April). Demand for this denim mini skirt spiked significantly in late March/early April (Period 7: 273 units), likely due to the spring seasonal transition, and has settled into a higher-than-initial mean (averaging ~123 units over the last 5 periods: 273, 126, 66, 88, 137). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 775 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we expect the order placed in Period 8 (316 units) to arrive during Period 12 and be visible in Period 13's start. This will alleviate the current stockout. To maintain sufficient stock for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), and accounting for the sustained shift since Period 7, I am using N=5 for the demand parameters (covering the shift from Period 7 to 11). Lead time L is held at the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mini Bea' denim skirt, which has seen fluctuating demand as we move into the spring/summer season (May). Historically, demand spiked in Period 7 (March 25) but has recently moderated. In Period 12, an order from Period 8 finally arrived after the promised 4-period lead time, resolving a stockout. My current on-hand inventory is 218 units, and there are 459 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 9 and 10). Given the lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Looking at the last 6 periods of demand (Periods 7-12: 273, 126, 66, 88, 137, 98), the average is approximately 131 units per period. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current seasonal demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend accounts for the increased volume compared to the early February/March baseline, while the 'in-transit' logic prevents over-ordering while waiting for the shipments from Periods 9 and 10.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. The product is a mini denim skirt, which transitioned into its high-demand spring/summer season around Period 7 (late March). However, recent demand (Periods 12 and 13) has moderated to an average of 79.5 units, down from the peak spike. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 12 and 13. Current on-hand inventory is 492 units, with 124 units in transit (expected Period 14). Total available (616 units) is significantly higher than the current average demand across the (L+1=5) period horizon (roughly 400-500 units). I am using recent_N for both mean and variance calculation (N=7 to capture the demand since the spring shift) to maintain a responsive but stable policy. No new orders are likely to be triggered by the OR backend given the high current inventory, which protects against holding costs.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/20. The item is a denim mini skirt, typically a spring/summer seasonal item. Historical demand showed a massive spike in late March (Period 7: 273 units), but has since leveled off significantly. Recent demand (Periods 12-14) has been 98, 61, and 81 units, averaging approximately 80 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently high (535 units) because orders from the peak demand period (Periods 8, 9, 10) have finally arrived (all with a stable lead time of 4 periods). With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Current inventory of 535 units covers the next 5 periods if demand remains around 80-100 units/period (535 / 5 = 107 units/period capacity). The OR backend's base-stock calculation will likely result in no new orders this period because on-hand inventory is sufficient. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the post-spike demand stabilization, which correctly reflects the current demand regime of ~80-100 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-spike: Demand from Period 10-14 averaged 93 units, down from the Period 7 peak of 273. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late May (Period 16: 2019/5/27). The product is a denim mini skirt, which typically sees higher demand in spring/summer. Historical demand showed a significant spike in late March/early April (Period 7-8) but has since stabilized. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is approximately 92.6 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 449 units with zero in-transit, as a series of orders placed in early April (P8-P10) have all arrived. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a stabilized mean of ~93, the required base stock is roughly 465 units (ignoring safety stock). Since we have 449 on hand, we are well-positioned but should maintain a steady replenishment to account for the ongoing summer demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this post-spike stable demand level (Periods 11-15: 137, 98, 61, 81, 86).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688105002' (Mini Bea Denim Skirt) has entered a stable post-spike demand regime as we move into June. Since the significant spike in Period 7 (273 units), demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has averaged 84 units per week, with a low of 61 and a high of 98. This suggests a return to a moderate demand level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 355 units currently on-hand and 14 in-transit, our total inventory coverage is roughly 4.4 periods of demand (369 total / ~84 mean). Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost), and the replenishment lead time L=4, the OR backend needs to maintain a balanced inventory. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the most recent stabilized demand pattern since late April, to prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the current mean.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 18 (June 10). The product is a mini denim skirt, which is highly relevant for the current summer season. Demand from Period 10 to 17 has stabilized around a mean of ~87.5 units per week (min 54, max 137), following the early spring spike in late March. Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 301 units and in-transit at 65 units (total 366), and a promised L=4 (covering L+1=5 periods of demand), our current position covers roughly 4.1 periods of demand at the recent average. Given the current summer season, demand is expected to remain steady or slightly increase. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the stable regime since Period 10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-spike demand environment. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been highly consistent across all arrivals.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a denim mini skirt, which typically sees peak demand in spring (April/May) and moderates in summer. Historical demand confirms this: after the spring spike in Period 7 (273 units), demand has stabilized. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), demand has averaged 71.6 units (81, 86, 94, 54, 43). There is a slight downward trend in the most recent two weeks (54, 43), possibly as the initial summer excitement for denim skirts cools. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 258, and there are 136 units in-transit (ordered in P16, P17, P18). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 394 units. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for the (L+1)=5 period window, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the post-spring demand stabilization (~72 units/week). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=5 to capture the current volatility, which is significantly lower than during the transition period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-spring demand (P14-P18) has stabilized to an average of ~72 units/period, down from the higher volatility seen in April/May.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a denim mini skirt, which typically sees peak demand in spring (April/May) and stabilizes or slightly declines as summer progresses. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 7 (March 25), followed by a lower, steadier regime. Over the last 5 periods (P15-P19), demand has averaged 77.8 units per period (86, 94, 54, 43, 112). I will set mu_hat based on this recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect the current stabilized demand level. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P12, P13, P14). On-hand inventory is 146 and in-transit is 136 (from orders in P16, P17, P18), totaling 282 units. Given L=4, the coverage needed is (L+1)=5 periods. 5 periods * 77.8 units/period = 389 units. The current pipeline (282) is below this requirement, so the OR backend should trigger a small replenishment order. I am using recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility and mean since the spring peak subsided.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 21 (2019/7/1). The product is a 'Skirt Mini Bea' (Ladies Denim), which typically sees peak demand in spring/early summer. Recent demand data shows a regime shift: P14-P18 averaged ~72 units, but demand in P19 (112) and P20 (134) suggests another upward shift (average 123) as we enter the peak summer month of July. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (26 units), and we have 229 units in transit (ordered in P17, P18, and P20). To capture this late-summer demand spike, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P18-P20) to reflect the recent uptick (avg ~96), while sigma_hat will use a slightly longer window (N=5) to account for the increasing volatility. L will be kept at 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: Demand increasing again for peak summer (July), rising from ~72 to an average of 123 units over the last 2 periods.

Demand has shown a significant upward trend starting from Period 19 (June 17), with recent demand values of 112, 134, and 139. This confirms the summer peak regime shift previously noted. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) due to this surge, though 338 units are in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P20 and P21). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~128 units/period). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the summer peak while accounting for the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime confirmed: Demand from P19-P21 averaged 128 units/period, a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~72 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688105002' (Mini Denim Skirt) is in the middle of its summer peak season (July). Over the last four periods (P19-P22), demand has significantly increased, averaging 129.25 units per period (112, 134, 139, 132), confirming a sustained summer demand regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is depleted (0 units), and we are relying on incoming shipments. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Recent demand average (~130) * 5 periods = 650 units total pipeline required. Current in-transit is 419 units (orders from P20, P21, P22). To restore the service level while managing the $1/unit holding cost, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this summer peak while sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for the increased volatility during this high-demand phase.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are in the middle of a summer peak demand regime for denim mini skirts, which began around Period 19. Demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) has been 112, 134, 139, 132, and 95, averaging approximately 122 units per period. Despite this drop to 95 last period, the overall July trend remains strong. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P20-P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 568 units in transit (ordered P20-P23: 107+160+152+149). The OR backend must now decide on the order for Period 24. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current summer demand regime (avg ~122) while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed during this peak. This will ensure mu_hat reflects the current (1+L) * 122 requirement and sigma_hat accounts for the risk of stockouts seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P19-P23) confirmed with an average of 122 units/period, despite a slight dip to 95 in P23.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019/07/29. We are in the peak summer season for the 'Mini Bea Skirt'. Demand has remained consistently elevated, with the last 5 periods (P20-P24) averaging 122.2 units per period (134, 139, 132, 95, 111). Despite a slight dip in P23, P24 returned to 111 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we are experiencing stockouts. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current demand regime (Summer Peak) started around P19/P20, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand period specifically. This will calculate a base stock level considering (1+L) = 5 periods of demand, helping to recover from the current stockout position while balancing the high holding cost (1.0 vs 1.0 profit/holding cost ratio).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26. The product is a denim mini skirt, which saw a demand spike in the summer (July). In Period 25 (July 29), demand was 81 units, slightly lower than the July average (~122 units), suggesting we may be moving past the peak of the summer season but still within a high-demand window. Inventory is currently low (79 units on hand) with significant in-transit (451 units). The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. Since demand is transitioning from the summer peak, I will use a recent_N window (N=7, covering demand from P19-P25) to capture the current regime which averages approximately 115 units per period. This balances the high July demand with the most recent lower observation. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been consistent.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/8/12). Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern for this 'Mini Bea Skirt': demand spiked in April (Spring) and maintained a high level through July (Summer peak), averaging roughly 122 units/period from Period 19-24. However, the last two periods (P25 and P26) have shown a decline in demand to 81 and 60 units respectively, suggesting the summer peak is ending as we transition into late summer/early autumn. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P24, P25, and P26). I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N (N=4) to capture the cooling demand while giving weight to the higher summer average to prevent stockouts if the decline is just a temporary dip. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to capture the volatility of the peak-to-trough transition. L is set to 'calculate' given the high consistency of the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: Seasonal summer peak (avg ~122) appears to be concluding, with demand dropping to an average of 70 units over the last 2 periods (P25-P26).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The 'Skirt Mini Bea' is a summer item (short denim skirt) approaching the end of its peak season. Historical data shows a clear downward shift in demand starting around Period 25 (July 29): demand averages for the last 3 periods (P25-P27) are 81, 60, and 57 (mean = 66), compared to the summer peak average of ~122. This suggests a transition from summer to late-summer/early-fall demand levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (263) due to recent arrivals, and there are 195 units in-transit (orders from P24-P26). Given the decreasing demand and existing inventory pipeline, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend and prevent over-ordering as the season concludes. This ensures we don't build excess holding costs for a seasonal item.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Late summer demand drop observed, with the last 3 periods (P25-P27) averaging 66 units/period, down from the summer peak average of 122.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26). Demand for this denim mini skirt has undergone a clear seasonal shift. After a summer peak that averaged ~122 units/period (P19-P24), demand has dropped significantly over the last 4 periods (P25-P28) to an average of 66.5 units/period (81, 60, 57, 68). This indicates the end of the summer season. On-hand inventory is currently high at 239 units due to the arrival of orders placed during the higher-demand period, and there are still 151 units in transit (from P25 and P26). Given the profit/holding cost ratio is 1.0 (implying a 50% service level target), we should avoid overstocking during this lower-demand regime. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this post-summer baseline. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P25-P28).

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Demand has dropped and stabilized to an average of ~67 units/period over the last 4 periods (P25-P28) as the peak summer season concludes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/9/2. We are in a post-summer demand regime for the 'Skirt Mini Bea'. As noted in current carry-over insights, demand dropped significantly starting at Period 25. The last five periods (P25-P29) have seen demands of 81, 60, 57, 68, and 37, averaging approximately 61 units. This confirms a clear downward shift from the summer peak average of ~122. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 308 units on-hand and 45 units in-transit (total 353 units), and a forecast mean demand of ~61 units per period, our current inventory covers approximately 5.8 periods of demand. Given the lead time is 4 periods and we review every period (L+1=5), we are currently slightly overstocked for the current demand regime. I will use the recent_N method (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this recent lower-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to minimize further orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Demand has averaged 61 units/period over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), down ~50% from the summer peak average of 122.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-09. We are in a post-summer demand regime for the 'Skirt Mini Bea' (a denim mini skirt), where demand has significantly dropped from the summer peak (avg ~122 units/period) to a stabilized lower level. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), demand has averaged approximately 57 units (81, 60, 57, 68, 37, 37). The most recent two periods (P29-P30) show a further dip to 37 units, likely representing the transition into autumn. On-hand inventory is currently high at 316 units, and there are no units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the review period, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. With 316 units on hand and a mean demand around 50-60 units, we already have 5-6 weeks of stock. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the post-summer average (~57 units/period) and maintain L=4. The backend will likely not place any more orders due to the high existing inventory relative to the lower seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Demand has averaged 57 units/period over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), with a potential further dip to 37 units observed in Sept (P29-P30).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688105002 (Mini Denim Skirt) is currently in a distinct post-summer demand decline. Since Period 25 (late July), demand has consistently dropped as the summer peak ended. For the last three periods (P29-P31), demand has stabilized at exactly 37 units per period. This represents a significant regime shift from the summer average of ~122. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 279 units. With a demand of 37/period, and a lead time L=4, the pipeline target (L+1 periods) is roughly 185 units. Since on-hand (279) already exceeds this target and there are no units in-transit, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 (from Period 25 onwards) to capture this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering during the seasonal downturn.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization: Demand has been exactly 37.0 units for three consecutive periods (P29-P31), confirming a late-season low regime. The average since the P25 shift is now 54 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for the 'Skirt Mini Bea', which is a seasonal summer item (denim mini skirt). Demand has significantly cooled down and stabilized: since Period 29 (late August), demand has been consistently low, recorded at 37, 37, 37, and now 32 in the most recent period (P32). The average demand over the last 4 periods is 35.75 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 247 units and no incoming in-transit shipments, the current stock is sufficient to cover approximately 6.9 periods of demand at the current rate (247 / 35.75). Given the seasonal decline of a summer skirt in late September, I will use recent_N with N=8 (covering the post-peak period starting from Period 25) to capture this lower mean and variance. The OR backend should naturally stop ordering since on-hand exceeds the target base stock, which is appropriate for a product entering its off-season to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer low-demand regime confirmed: Demand from P29-P32 has averaged 35.75 units/period, down from the P25-P28 average of 66.5 units/period, reflecting the end of the seasonal peak for summer skirts.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688105002 (Ladies Denim Mini Skirt) is currently in a low-demand post-summer regime. Demand has been significantly lower since Period 25 (late July/August), with recent periods mostly ranging between 32-37 units, though Period 33 saw a sudden spike to 90 units. Given the seasonality (late September), this spike is likely volatility or a small outlier rather than a sustained regime shift upward. On-hand inventory is currently high (157 units) relative to the recent average demand (~44 units over the last 9 periods). With a promised lead time (L) of 4 periods and a desired coverage of L+1 (5 periods), the current inventory (157 on-hand + 9 in-transit = 166 units) already covers roughly 3.7 periods of demand even at the recent mean. However, to maintain the safety stock and manage the risk from recent volatility (the 90 unit spike), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 (covering the post-peak period) to capture the average demand of ~44.4. This targets a base stock of (1+4)*44.4 = 222 units. Since 166 < 222, the backend will place a small top-up order while acknowledging the high on-hand levels to avoid excessive holding costs if demand returns to the 30s.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand volatility observed in P33 (90 units) following a stable low-demand period (avg 35-37), but seasonality (late September) suggests continued low baseline demand for denim mini skirts.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07. We are analyzing SKU 688105002 (Denim Mini Skirt). Demand has been in a post-summer low regime since P25. Over the last 6 periods (P29-P34), demand has averaged 46.7 units/period, notably influenced by a single spike to 90 in P33; looking specifically at the most recent 2-week 'stabilization' (P33-P34), the average is 68.5 units. Given that we are entering October (fall), demand for denim mini skirts is typically lower than summer, but the P33-P34 data suggests the baseline is slightly higher than the 30s observed in early September. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (arrived units consistently match orders from 4 periods prior). On-hand inventory is 110, with 100 units in-transit (9 units from P33 and 91 from P34). To cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the recent average of ~68.5 units, we need a base stock of roughly 342. Since (on-hand 110 + pipeline 100) = 210, the OR backend will place an order to move toward that base stock. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the full post-summer low volatility, and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the recent variance.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688105002' (denim mini skirt) is currently in a post-summer low-demand phase as we enter mid-October. Since the major demand drop at Period 25, the average demand has been approximately 50-60 units, but more recently (P29-P35), demand has stabilized at a lower mean with one outlier in P33. The average demand over the last 11 periods (since P25) is 51.8 units, while the average of the last 4 periods (P32-P35) is 55.75 units. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning the OR engine should target the median/mean. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 56 units on-hand and 124 in-transit (total 180), we are currently covered for about 3-3.5 periods of demand at the current rate (55 units/period). I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7, covering P29-P35) to capture the current late-season baseline, which averages 47.7 units per period. This results in a mu_hat of approx 238.5 for the 5-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for denim skirts (P25-P35) has stabilized at an average of ~52 units/period, significantly lower than the summer peak of 122 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37 (Oct 21), we are firmly in the post-summer low-demand regime for denim mini skirts. Demand has stabilized significantly since the summer peak (avg ~122), with the last 12 periods (P25-P36) averaging 53 units/period. The most recent demand (P34-P36) has been 47, 54, and 47, suggesting a stable baseline around 50 units. The current on-hand inventory is very low (9 units). In-transit inventory is 183 units (orders from P33, P34, P35, P36), with the first batch (9 units from P33) expected to arrive in Period 37 conclusion. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand. At an average of 53 units/period, the target base stock is approximately 265 units. Current pipeline (on-hand 9 + in-transit 183 = 192) is below this. I will use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the post-summer average while maintaining sensitivity to recent fluctuations, and default for L as physical arrivals have consistently matched the 4-period promise.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product is a denim mini skirt, which is past its peak summer season. The 'Post-summer demand regime' was previously identified as averaging ~52 units (P25-P35). Recent demand (P33-P37) shows: 90, 47, 54, 47, 55, averaging 58.6 units. This indicates a relatively stable late-autumn baseline higher than the Sept lows but lower than summer. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with 252 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate (confirmed in P37: P33 order arrived). To calculate parameters, I'll use the last 5 periods (P33-P37) to capture this stable post-summer baseline. N=5 is chosen as it reflects the current demand regime following the end-of-summer dip.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization: Demand from P33-P37 has stabilized to an average of 58.6 units/period, slightly higher than the Sept low of 37 units but significantly lower than the summer peak of 122 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is a denim mini skirt, which typically follows clear seasonal trends (higher demand in spring/summer, lower in fall/winter). Demand has stabilized since Period 33, averaging 58.6 units (P33-P38: 90, 47, 54, 47, 55, 71). The recent spike to 71 in Period 38 is slightly above the post-summer mean but within observed volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P33 order arrived P37, P34 order arrived P38). I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 (covering P33-P38) to capture the current stable late-season regime and avoid over-ordering based on the high summer peak history. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect current volatility levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for denim mini skirts, which has shown stabilization since Period 33. Over the last 7 periods (P33-P39), demand has averaged 59.4 units, which is a significant drop from the summer peak of 122 but consistent with autumn seasonality. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 260 units in-transit (orders from P36, P37, P38, and P39). The P36 order (59 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 40 resolution phase. To maintain service levels while avoiding excess holding costs (as profit and holding costs are equal), I will set the demand forecast based on the most recent 7-period 'post-summer' regime. This ensures a responsive base stock calculation that reflects the latest localized average while smoothing out recent volatility (like the P33 spike).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P33-P39) has stabilized at an average of 59.4 units per period, consistently lower than the summer peak of 122 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is a denim mini skirt, which typically sees lower demand in winter. Since the post-summer shift at Period 25, demand has settled into a lower regime, with the most recent 8 periods (P33-P40) averaging 54 units. Period 40 demand dipped to 35 units, consistent with seasonal expectations. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (24), but there is a significant pipeline (239). mu_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture this stabilized post-summer/autumn demand pattern (~54/period), while sigma_hat is set with recent_N=8 to account for recent volatility spikes like P33. These parameters will help maintain enough stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5) without over-ordering into the winter season.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for denim mini skirts. Demand has consistently trended downward as winter approaches, with the last 2 periods (P40-P41) showing a significant dip to 35 and 33 units respectively. This is lower than the previous stabilization average of ~60 units observed between P33-P39. Given the seasonality of denim mini skirts, demand is likely to remain at this lower level or continue to decrease during the winter months. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this latest downshift (averaging ~40 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P37 order arrived in P41). On-hand inventory is 69, and in-transit is 180 (orders from P38-P41), totaling 249 units against a projected 5-period requirement of approximately 200 units, suggesting we are well-positioned but should slightly reduce order volume to reflect the lower demand reality and avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: Demand has decreased further as winter approaches, averaging 34 units/period over the last 2 periods (P40-P41), down from the previous Autumn average of ~60 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Period 42 showed a unexpected demand spike to 144 units, which is uncharacteristic for a denim mini skirt in winter and contradicts the downward trend observed in Periods 40-41 (avg 34). This could be a pre-holiday promotion or a data outlier. However, the system is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with 139 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41). With L=4, the P39 order (82 units) is expected to arrive in Period 43 resolved in the Period 44 start message. While Period 42 was high, the overall late-year regime (P40-P42) averages ~70 units. Given the outlier in P42, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to account for this sudden volatility while acknowledging the broader seasonal decline, setting L to recent_N (N=5) to maintain the confirmed 4-period stability. This balances the risk of another spike against the high holding costs of overstocking a seasonal summer item in December.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Significant demand outlier (144 units) detected in early December, deviating from the established winter downward trend; monitoring to see if this reflects a sustained pre-holiday spike or a one-time event.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9). The current on-hand inventory is 44 units, and in-transit is 233 units (ordered in Periods 40-43: 38, 19, 0, 176). The demand in Period 42 showed a significant outlier spike of 144 units, which then dropped back to 38 units in Period 43. This pattern likely reflects a brief pre-holiday or early-December promotion/event rather than a sustained shift, given the product is a denim mini skirt in winter. However, with only 4 periods remaining in the game (P44-P47) and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P44) will arrive in Period 48\u2014which is after the game ends. Therefore, placing further orders is unnecessary as they cannot contribute to revenue but will incur costs if they were to contribute to the pipeline. However, the OR engine logic requires parameters to manage the current state. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the recent average while acknowledging the volatility. I'll use recent_N=4 to capture the mix of the low winter baseline and the P42 spike (avg ~62). L remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Pre-holiday demand outlier (144 units) in P42 did not persist into P43 (38 units), suggesting a one-time event rather than a regime shift. Game concluding in 4 periods; orders placed from P44 onwards will not arrive before game end.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45, and the game ends in Period 47. With a promised and consistent lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) will not arrive until Period 49 (after the game ends), as indicated in the carry-over insight from Period 44. The current inventory position is: On-hand = 25, In-transit = 231 (comprising orders from P41: 19 units, P43: 176 units, and P44: 36 units). The order from P41 is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 45 and will be visible at the start of Period 46. Given that the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%. Since no new orders can arrive before the game concludes, further ordering only risks incurring holding costs on items that won't arrive in time to be sold. I will set the parameters to effectively stop new ordering by acknowledging the limited remaining time and the sufficient pipeline already in transit for the final two periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 46, and the game concludes in Period 47. Based on the 4-period lead time, any order placed now (Period 46) would not arrive until Period 50, which is well past the game's end. The current goal is to maximize the final reward by clearing remaining stock and avoiding unnecessary holding costs on units that cannot be sold within the remaining timeframe. We have 0 units on-hand and 263 units in-transit. Based on the lead time history, the order from Period 42 (0 units) would have arrived in Period 46, and the order from Period 43 (176 units) is expected to arrive during Period 47 (after the current decision phase). This arrival of 176 units should be sufficient to cover the demand for the final period (Period 47), which we estimate around the recent average of 50-60 units. Therefore, we set the parameters to effectively stop new ordering by keeping mu_hat low and relying on the incoming pipeline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the final period of the game. Based on the 4-period lead time, any order placed now or in the previous few periods (since Period 44) will not arrive before the simulation concludes. The current inventory status shows 0 units on-hand and 263 units in-transit (composed of orders from P43, P44, and P45). Specifically, the order of 176 units from P43 is expected to arrive during this period (P47) based on the stable 4-period lead time observed throughout the history. This arrival will satisfy the current period's demand. Since further orders cannot arrive within the game's timeframe, the goal is to set parameters that prevent redundant ordering while maintaining a baseline forecast. Demand has recently averaged around 51 units (P43-P46), which is consistent with the late-season winter regime.
