Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 112.6 units (range 87-146). The current period is 2019/2/11. The promised lead time is 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit at 0, I must place an order immediately to cover the pipeline. My target inventory level is calculated to cover approximately 5 periods of demand (Lead time L=4 + 1 for the current period's lag) plus a small safety stock. Using the historical average of ~113 units, the targeted total pipeline stock is (5 * 113) + safety stock. I will place an initial order of 650 units to establish the pipeline and prepare for deliveries arriving in Period 5/6.",

Historical samples (Jan-Feb) show demand between 87 and 146, with a jump to 173 in Period 1 (Valentine's Day week). The current date is Feb 18, which is post-Valentine's but still late winter. Demand is expected to stabilize near its historical mean of ~120-130 units/week. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since arrivals occur during the arrival phase and orders are placed at the decision phase, an order placed in P1 arrives in P5, and an order placed in P2 arrives in P6. My pipeline (In-transit) is 650 units from P1, which covers demand for Periods 5 through 9 at ~130 units/period (650 / 5 = 130). However, I have 0 on-hand inventory to meet demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4, resulting in lost sales until the P1 shipment arrives. To cover the next coverage window (Period 6 and onwards) and maintain a safety stock against higher-than-average demand or potential shipment delays, I need to ensure the pipeline covers approximately 5-6 weeks of demand (L+1 + safety). Period 1 order (650) already covers the first 5 weeks of demand once it arrives. I will place a smaller supplemental order of 150 to maintain the flow for Period 6.",

Profit is equal to holding cost ($1.00), suggesting we should be cautious about overstocking but must prioritize filling demand once arrivals begin. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 (650 units) is expected to arrive DURING Period 5 (visible at Period 6 startup). Current pipeline: P1: 650, P2: 150, P3: 200 (Total in-transit: 1000). To cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the new average of ~175, we need ~875 units in the system.

The spike in P1-P2 suggests a promotion or seasonal peak that is now normalizing back towards historical levels (P4 demand was 96). c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. P1 order (650 units) was placed on Feb 11. Following the 'L=4' rule, it should arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at P6). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0.

The 'regime shift' insight from Period 3 may have been a temporary spike rather than a permanent shift. I will forecast a moderating demand of ~120-130 units/period. (c) Lead Time: Period 1 order (650 units) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 549.

(e) Decision: Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 899. Expected demand over the next 5 periods (Lead time 4 + current period) at 130/unit is 650. Given that holding cost equals profit ($1.0), overstocking is as penalizing as stockouts. I have 899 units to cover 650-750 units of demand over the replenishment lead time.

The arrival of large orders placed early in the game (P1-P3) has built a significant on-hand inventory of 695 units. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1, P2, and P3. Given the current on-hand inventory (695) and the stable demand rate (~100/period), the current stock covers approximately 7 periods of demand. This exceeds the pipeline requirement of (L+1) = 5 periods. Additionally, the profit-to-holding cost ratio is 1:1, meaning there is no financial incentive to overstock; holding excess inventory is as costly as the profit gained from a sale.

Historical demand averages roughly 100 units/period (P4-P8), with a recent dip to ~60 (P9-P11, P13) and a spike to 157 in P12. The average demand across all concluded periods (P1-P13) is approximately 110 units. Currently, Period 14 (mid-May) does not present significant seasonal retail events that would drastically spike demand for basic underwear beyond normal fluctuation. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline Assessment: On-hand (193) + In-transit (250) = 443 units. The in-transit units are from P11 (50 units arriving P15) and P13 (200 units arriving P17). Inventory levels need to cover the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Expected demand for 5 periods @ 100 units = 500 units.

Historical data and seasonal trends suggest a transition from the high summer demand peak (June-July avg ~176) towards a slightly lower late-summer/early-autumn baseline. B) Demand Regime Analysis: Demand over the last 4 periods has been remarkably consistent, averaging 143 units (138, 126, 156, 151). This confirms the moderation from the July peak but maintains a higher floor than the spring average (~100). For forecasting, I will use 145 units/period. C) Lead Time & Inventory: Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current On-hand is 321. In-transit pipeline includes: P24 (170 units due P29), P25 (0), P26 (0), P27 (50 units due P32). Total pipeline is 220 units. D) Pipeline Assessment: We need to cover demand through the arrival of an order placed today (P28 arriving P33).

Historically, demand in November has been active, and world knowledge suggests a build-up towards Black Friday and holiday shopping. The recent demand regime (P37-P40) has averaged approximately 127 units per period. With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for P41 through P45. The pipeline currently consists of 3 units on-hand plus 680 units in-transit (P37: 150, P38: 170, P39: 180, P40: 180). Expected arrivals over the next 4 periods are 150 (P41), 170 (P42), 180 (P43), and 180 (P44). Total inventory available to cover the lead time + current period (5 periods) is 3 + 680 = 683 units. At a forecast of ~140 units/period (accounting for holiday uplift), we need approximately 700 units (140 * 5) to maintain high service levels. Given that 683 units are already in the pipeline or on-hand, an order of 150 units for P45 is appropriate to sustain the holiday coverage and prevent stockouts as we enter late December.",

The order from P40 (180 units) is arriving this period (P44), which will be added to the current on-hand of 69 units, giving a total available stock of 249 to meet P44 demand. To maintain a safety stock against Christmas volatility and cover the (L+1) window (P44-P48), I calculate the total requirement: (Expected Demand 130 * 5) = 650 units.

Given the product is a 3-pack of cotton/lace briefs (Womens Lingerie), demand is relatively steady but sensitive to major shopping holidays.
