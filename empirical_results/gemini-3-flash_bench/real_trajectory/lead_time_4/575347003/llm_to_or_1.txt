Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', a staple product with relatively stable demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no historical lead time data yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (4). For demand, we have 5 historical samples: 29, 28, 41, 40, 31. The mean is 33.8 and the standard deviation is 6.22. Given the seasonal context (post-winter, heading into spring), sneaker socks might see a slight uptick, but the current samples include both low (28) and high (41) values. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution accurately during the ramp-up phase. The backend will calculate base_stock using the given profit ($19) and holding cost ($1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is '7pk basic sneaker socks', a staple item. Initial historical demand (5 weeks: 29, 28, 41, 40, 31) average is 33.8 units/week. Period 1 demand was 39 units, but we had 0 on-hand, resulting in 39 lost sales. The promised lead time (L) is 4. An order of 45 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit; it is expected to arrive in Period 5 (1 + 4). Since current on-hand is 0 and we are facing immediate stockouts, we need to set parameters to ensure the OR engine covers demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Based on stable historical data and the recent Period 1 observation, I will use all 6 available samples (5 history + P1) to estimate mu and sigma. I will use 'explicit' for L to ensure 4 is used, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent demand level.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand for Period 1 was 39 and Period 2 was 51, following historical samples in the 30-40 range. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Orders placed in P1 (45 units) and P2 (45 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in P5 and P6 respectively. On-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. Current historical demand samples (including pre-game) are: 29, 28, 41, 40, 31, 39, 51. The mean of all 7 samples is 37. With L=4, the base stock targets (L+1) demand. I will use the default lead time (4) and explicit forecasts for mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat = (4+1) * 37 = 185. Standard deviation of samples is ~8.1, so sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 8.1 \u2248 18.1. These parameters will help the OR backend calculate orders that cover the pipeline until P1's shipment arrives.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is 7-pack basic sneaker socks, a staple item. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed all sales because arrivals haven't started. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (visible P6), so seeing zero arrivals in P1-P3 is expected behavior. However, demand is showing a clear upward trend (39, 51, 62) following the pre-history mean of ~34. This suggests a seasonal shift or regime change as we move from February into March. To capture this growth and ensure we aren't under-ordering when shipments finally arrive, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand (mu_hat) to weight the recent climb more heavily. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=3) because the volatility has increased alongside the mean. L remains at default (4) as we haven't reached the first expected arrival window yet to verify actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from pre-history ~34 to ~50.6 (last 3 periods), showing a consistent upward trend entering March.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is '7pk basic sneaker socks', a staple item. Since the start of the game (Period 1), we have had 0 on-hand inventory and have missed all sales because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 (45 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Demand for the last 4 periods has averaged 51.25 (39, 51, 62, 53), which is significantly higher than the pre-history average of ~31.8. This confirms the previously noted demand regime shift. Pipeline inventory is currently 211 units (45+45+51+70). To ensure the OR backend covers the demand for the lead time (4) plus the review period (1), I am setting L to default (4) and mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the higher demand regime, translating to an expected demand of (1+4) * 51.25 = 256.25 units across the window. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand over the last 4 periods is 51.25, vs pre-history ~32. Expected first arrival (from Period 1) due during Period 5 resolution.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 with a lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The SKU (7pk basic cotton socks) is showing a demand regime significantly higher than the pre-history average (31.8). The last five periods of demand are 39, 51, 62, 53, 44, averaging 49.8 units/period. The slight dip in Period 5 (44) may be natural variation or a minor stabilization after the peak in Period 3. With on-hand inventory at only 1 unit and 233 units in transit (expected arrivals in Period 6, 7, 8, and 9), we must maintain high parameters to ensure the OR backend's order calculation covers the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime (~250 total units for the 5-period window), and sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand regime remains stable at new elevated level (Avg ~50 vs pre-history ~32).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', a high-volume staple. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been confirmed by arrivals in Period 5 (ordered P1) and Period 6 (ordered P2). A clear demand regime shift was detected starting around Period 2; pre-history demand averaged ~32, while the history (P1-P6) averages 51.0, and the last 3 periods (P4-P6) average 51.33. On-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Period 6 (57) exceeded supply (current period supply 46: 1 from P5 + 45 arrival). The pipeline inventory is 236 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Since demand is stable at this new level (~51), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the shift) to compute (1+L)*51. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility (std of {51, 62, 53, 44, 57} is ~6.8). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) while we await the larger orders placed in P3 and P4 to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $969.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '7pk basic R sneaker socks' has transitioned into a higher demand regime. Current date is 2019/4/1. Over the last 5 periods, the demand has been [53, 44, 57, 66, 39, 51, 62], with the most recent 4 periods averaging 55 units (53, 44, 57, 66). Stockouts have occurred in the last two periods because demand (57, 66) exceeded the arriving quantities (45, 51) and existing inventory (1, 0). Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the last 3 arrivals. Pipeline inventory is 241, and on-hand is 0. To address the persistent stockouts and higher demand level, I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture the current mean of approx 55 units/week. Since L=4, the base stock targets 5 periods of demand (approx 275 units). With 241 in transit and 0 on hand, the backend will order approximately 34 units (plus safety stock), which balances the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Last 4 periods (P4-P7) average demand is 55.0 units, significantly higher than pre-history avg of 32. Heavy stockouts in P6 and P7 confirm that supply is current trailing demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019-04-08). Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods (P4 order arrived in P8). Demand has significantly shifted upward from the pre-history average of 32. In P8, demand spiked to 95 units, and the average over the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is 65.5. The previous five samples (P4-P8) average 63. This upward trend is likely driven by spring seasonality for '7pk basic R sneaker socks'. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 239 units in-transit (orders from P5-P8). To ensure the OR backend captures this new demand regime, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include the most recent growth and higher volatility. Using N=5 captures the jump from ~50 to ~95 units. mu_hat will be based on (1+L)*63 = 315 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating into April: Last 4 periods (P5-P8) average demand is 65.5 units (vs P1-P4 average of 51.25), peaking at 95 in P8. Stockouts have occurred in 3 of the last 4 periods due to this growth.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '575347003' (7pk basic R sneaker socks) is experiencing a sustained and accelerating demand growth as we move into April. The most recent demand (P9: 73, P8: 95) is significantly higher than the initial history (~32). We have been out of stock for four consecutive periods (P6-P9) because arrivals are lagging behind this upward trend. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a high profit/holding cost ratio ($19/$1), the priority must be capturing the higher demand levels. Using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) captures the current April average (~71.75 per period), and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat reflects the increased variability during this growth phase. This will increase the base stock calculation to account for the current demand regime and ensure the pipeline inventory is sufficient to meet (L+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in April: Avg demand for last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 66.4, compared to P1-P4 avg of 51.25. Continued stockouts (P6-P9) indicate target base stock levels are trailing the growth curve.

We are currently in a high-growth phase for '7pk basic R sneaker socks' as we move deeper into spring (April). Demand has consistently outstripped supply, resulting in five consecutive periods of stockouts (P6-P10). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 74.4 units, with a peak of 95 in P8. Total demand across lead time (L+1=5 periods) is currently estimated at 372 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 320 (consisting of orders from P7-P10). Specifically, P7 (56 units), P8 (68 units), P9 (96 units), and P10 (100 units) are expected to arrive in P11, P12, P13, and P14 respectively. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), we must aggressively set mu_hat to cover this sustained demand growth to prevent further lost sales during the lead time transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April demand average increased to 74.4 units (P6-P10), up from 51.25 in P1-P4. This 45% increase has caused five consecutive periods of stockouts.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (late April). Demand remains in a high-growth phase, with Period 11 demand hitting a historical peak of 145 units. The last 5 periods (P7-P11) have averaged approximately 92 units per week, which is a significant increase from the previous April estimates. Since Period 6, we have experienced six consecutive periods of stockouts because ordered quantities (based on earlier, lower demand) have been insufficient to meet this accelerating growth. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and catch up with this demand surge, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover (1+L) periods, reflecting the latest peak average of ~92 units per week (92 * 5 = 460). sigma_hat is increased to account for the heightened volatility observed in the last two weeks (95 and 145 demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly in late April: Period 11 demand peaked at 145, bringing the 5-period average (P7-P11) to ~92 units, a 39% increase over the early April average (~66). Six consecutive periods of stockouts confirmed.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '7pk basic R sneaker socks' has entered a period of aggressive seasonal growth as we move into May. The last five periods (P8-P12) show demand of 95, 73, 81, 145, and 130 respectively, resulting in a mean of 104.8 units. The SKU has stocked out for seven consecutive periods (P6-P12), as actual sales have been capped by incoming shipments ordered during a lower-demand regime. The stock-out in Period 12 was severe (demand 130 vs 68 available). To stop this cycle, \u03bc\u0302 must be set to reflect this new average of ~105 per period across the (L+1) horizon. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, the total demand to cover is 5 periods (L+1). My target base stock must rise to account for this higher mean and the significantly increased volatility observed in April. I will utilize the recent_N method with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture this recent spike while maintaining some stability against the single extreme observation of 145.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly throughout April and early May: 5-period avg (P8-P12) reached 104.8 units, a ~58% increase over the early April avg (~66). Seven consecutive periods of stockouts (P6-P12) confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1664.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a '7pk basic R sneaker socks', and we are entering mid-May. Demand has seen a significant upward trend throughout April and early May, with recent weekly demands of 145, 130, and 88. The 5-period average (P9-P13) is 107.4 units/period, compared to the early April average of ~66. Although P13 demand (88) was lower than the previous two peaks, it still remains at a high level compared to the start of the year. The system has experienced stockouts in 7 of the last 8 periods, only barely avoiding it in P13 (OH=8). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, and P9 orders). To recover from the chronic stockouts and account for the new demand regime (approx 107 units/week), I am using L=default (4), mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent high-volume trend, and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility from 145/130 to 88.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level into mid-May: 5-period average (P9-P13) is 107.4 units, a 62% increase over early April levels (~66). Chronic stockouts (7 of last 8 periods) demonstrate that inventory levels haven't yet caught up with the Spring/Summer demand surge for sneaker socks.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', which typically experiences a significant demand surge during late spring and early summer (May/June). We are currently in mid-May (Period 15). Demand has stabilized at a high level, with a 5-period average (P10-P14) of 107.8 units. Although stockouts have decreased slightly in the last two periods (P13, P14) as larger orders from April began arriving, the demand remains significantly higher than the initial pre-history and early season levels. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met. To prevent a return to the chronic stockouts seen in April, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this established high-demand regime, and calculating L based on the consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high level for sneaker socks in mid-May: 5-period average (P10-P14) is 107.8 units, compared to ~66 in early April. Inventory is beginning to catch up with demand as lead-time 4 arrivals reflect the adjusted order volumes.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', a seasonal item that has experienced a major demand surge as spring transitioned into summer. Demand has increased from a pre-history average of ~30 to over 100 units per week. Period 15 showed continued high demand (131 units), resulting in another stockout as the arrival (99 units) plus opening inventory (13 units) was insufficient. The 5-period moving average (P11-P15) is now approximately 118 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we are entering late May/early June, demand for sneaker socks is expected to remain near its seasonal peak. Parameters are set to capture this elevated regime: L=4 (promised/confirmed), mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the ~118 unit/period demand level across the (L+1)=5 window, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility (ranging from 88 to 145) seen in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth for sneaker socks continued through May: 5-period average (P11-P15) reached ~118 units, a 78% increase over early April levels (~66). Chronic stockouts persist (10 of the last 11 periods) as demand continues to significantly outpace available on-hand inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'sneaker socks', which experiences strong seasonal demand growth during the transition into summer (June). Period 16 demand was 153 units, and the 5-period average (P12-P16) is 119.4 units, representing a significant increase over April levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Despite the arrival of 155 units in P16, the system only has 2 units on-hand due to demand (153) almost perfectly matching the delivery. We are enters June (2019/6/3), which is peak season for sneaker socks. To prevent further stockouts and account for continued seasonal growth, I will use the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set the base stock level using the higher mean and volatility observed during the May surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth for sneaker socks continued through June 1st: 5-period average (P12-P16) reached ~119 units, a nearly 100% increase compared to early April levels (~66).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (sneaker socks) is in peak summer seasonality. Demand remains elevated with a 5-period average (P13-P17) of 114.8 units, though Period 17 saw a slight dip to 105. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (54) plus in-transit stock (534) needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the high profit margins ($19 vs $1 holding cost), the priority remains avoiding stockouts during this peak season. While on-hand inventory is finally accumulating slightly, demand volatility remains high (standard deviation of ~27 over the last 5 periods). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the current high-demand regime, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in April/May.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for sneaker socks stabilized at a high level for early June: 5-period average (P13-P17) is 114.8 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '7pk basic R sneaker socks' has transitioned from a high-growth phase in late April/early May into a seasonally stable, high-demand summer regime. Period 18 demand (87) and Period 17 demand (105) are lower than the late-May peaks (~150), suggesting the rapid growth rate is flattening as we move further into June. The 5-period average (P14-P18) is approximately 112 units. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory finally at a healthy level (83) and a robust pipeline (502), the strategy is to set parameters that maintain this service level without over-ordering as the peak potentially plateaus. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand level (approx 112 units/period), and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen during this transition. L is set to 'calculate' to continue using the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand for sneaker socks appears to have plateaued in mid-June: the 5-period average (P14-P18) is ~112 units, down from the peak 5-period average of ~119 units in early June.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (June 24, 2019), the demand for sneaker socks remains high but appears to have plateaued after the late spring/early summer surge. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 124.8 units, while the average over the last 10 periods (P10-P19) is 108.3 units. The most recent demand (P19) spiked to 148, which suggests high volatility rather than a new upward trend. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P15 arrival in P19). With on-hand inventory at 38 and in-transit at 486 (covering orders from P16-P19), we finally have sufficient stock in the pipeline to meet the elevated demand regime. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand, high-variance plateau, while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand for sneaker socks reached a high-volume plateau in June, with a 5-period average (P15-P19) of 124.8 units and high volatility. Inventory levels in-transit (486 units) have finally synchronized with this higher demand level.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of July 1st, we are in the peak summer season for 'sneaker socks'. Demand is experiencing high volatility and has reached a new high-volume plateau. Period 20 saw a demand spike to 198 units, resulting in a stockout despite a significant arrival. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 138.2 units, up from the late June 5-period average of 124.8. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the 198-unit peak, I am adjusting mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the current high-velocity demand environment and setting the L calculation to 'recent_N' for stable lead-time estimation. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the high demand volatility observed over the last month.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a high-volume peak in late June/early July: 5-period average (P16-P20) reached 138.2 units, with Period 20 demand peaking at 198 units. Inventory levels are struggling to stay ahead of these high-volume summer spikes.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', which is at the height of its summer seasonality in July. Demand has reached a high-volume peak, with the last 5 periods (P17-P21) averaging 139.2 units, significantly higher than previous periods. We experienced a major spike of 198 units in P20 and stayed high at 158 units in P21. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this summer peak regime and ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent further stockouts during this high-volume period.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Average demand for late June/early July (P17-P21) reached 139.2 units, a significant increase from the May/early June average of ~112 units. Demand volatility remains high during this peak seasonality.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', exhibiting strong summer seasonality as temperatures rise in July. Demand history confirms a significant peak: the 5-period average (P18-P22) has reached approximately 143 units, up from ~112 units in mid-June. Period 20 saw a high of 198 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 18 arrival (84 units) was significantly lower than the previous period's arrival (165 units) and current demand (123 units), leading to a stockout. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend should prioritize a high service level. I am using recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this current mid-summer peak while excluding the lower-demand May/June data. The in-transit pipeline (681 units) reflects higher orders placed recently to catch up with this growth.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand peak for sneaker socks confirmed: 5-period average (P18-P22) rose to ~143 units, with extreme volatility (max 198, min 87 in last 6 periods). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', a core summer seasonal item. Demand peaked significantly in late June/July, with the most recent demand (Period 23) at 126 units and a 5-period average (P19-P23) of 150.6 units. We are currently facing stockouts (Period 22-23) because the orders placed 4 weeks ago (P18-P19) were too low (~85 units) for the current peak demand levels. The pipeline is now stocked with larger orders (P20-P23: 172, 210, 212, 185) reaching a total of 779 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the fact that we are in the peak summer season, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the high-volume plateau (~150/week) and sigma_hat using N=5 to account for the high summer variance. This ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 = 5 periods of demand) remains robust against further spikes.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand for sneaker socks plateaued at ~150 units/week in July (5-period average P19-P23: 150.6). High volatility continues during this seasonal window.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '575347003' (7pk sneaker socks) is currently in its summer peak season. Analyzing demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24: 198, 158, 123, 126, 117), there's a slight cooling from the late June peak of 198, with the 5-period average stabilizing around 144.4 units/week. Stockouts occurred in 3 of those 5 periods (P20, P22, P23), though P24 ended with a surplus (55 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend targets a high service level (~95%). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand summer plateau while weighting recent volatility. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the high variance (std dev ~31) observed during this peak window, ensuring the safety stock is sufficient for remaining summer spikes.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand for sneaker socks plateaued in July with 5-period average (P20-P24) at 144.4 units/week and high volatility (range 117-198).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering August (2019-08-05). Historical data and previous carry-over insights indicate that '7pk basic R sneaker socks' experienced a significant summer peak in June and July, with demand averages rising above 140 units. However, Period 25 shows a sharp decline in demand to 79 units. This suggests the summer peak is likely concluding. When comparing recent windows: P21-P25 average is 120.6, while the P23-P25 (last 3 periods) average has dropped to 107.3. Given the seasonal nature of 'sneaker socks', it is prudent to shift the forecast to a 'recent_N' approach (N=5) to reflect this cooling demand while still maintaining protection against the high volatility observed recently. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory (186) and high in-transit volume (582) are currently sufficient to cover this transitioning demand level, so OR parameters should focus on stabilizing stock levels during this seasonal step-down.

Carry-over insight: Demand for sneaker socks appears to be exiting the summer peak: Period 25 demand dropped to 79 subunits, significantly below the July average of ~150. A cooling trend is likely as we transition into August.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering mid-August (2019-08-12), and demand for sneaker socks is showing clear signs of cooling after the July peak. Period 25 and 26 demand (79 and 106 units) are significantly lower than the July average of ~150 units. We are currently well-stocked with 292 units on-hand and 370 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the peak). To avoid excessive holding costs as the season winds down, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the recent cooling trend. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward shift (average demand for P24-P26 is ~100.7). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: August demand (beginning P25) has dropped to an average of ~92 units (P25-P26), down from the July peak average of ~150 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1143.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has clearly transitioned from its summer seasonal peak (July average ~150) to a lower late-August regime. The last three periods (P25-P27) show demands of 79, 106, and 81, averaging 88.6 units. This confirms the 'cooling trend' noted in the insights. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a current on-hand inventory of 396 units plus 185 in-transit (total pipeline 581), we are significantly over-stocked relative to this new lower demand regime. The target base stock for a 5-period window (L+1) at a mean of ~89 units would be roughly 445 units plus a safety buffer; our current 581 units already exceed this. Consequently, the OR backend will likely calculate a zero or near-zero order to burn off excess inventory and minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this post-peak regime precisely, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects the current data rather than the defunct summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend finalized: Demand has transitioned from a July peak (~150 avg) to an August average of 88.6 (P25-P27), a ~40% reduction.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a confirmed seasonal cooling-off period for sneaker socks as we transition from the summer peak (July avg ~150) into late August. Demand for the last 4 periods (P25-P28) has consistently dropped, averaging 83.25 units (79, 106, 81, 67). Current on-hand inventory is 415 units, with an additional 99 units arriving via the order from Period 25. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and the current inventory position of 514 units (on-hand + in-transit), we are significantly overstocked relative to the new demand regime. To avoid excessive holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect this lower demand level. No new orders should be triggered by the OR backend as the current pipeline far exceeds the necessary base stock for an ~83 unit/period demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed and stable: Late August demand (P25-P28) averaged 83.25 units, down ~45% from the July peak of ~150.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has exited its summer peak and settled into a lower autumn regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is approximately 78.4 units, representing a ~48% decrease from the July peak of ~150 units. We are now in Period 30 (September), where demand is historically lower for this product category. Current on-hand inventory is 455 units with zero in-transit. With an average demand of ~78 units and a lead time of 4 periods, our current stock covers approximately 5.8 periods of demand. Given the OR backend's goal to minimize holding costs while maintaining service levels, we must allow this excess inventory to deplete before placing new orders. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the post-summer cooling trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for September established: Avg demand (P25-P29) dropped to 78.4 units, confirming a transition from summer peaks (~150) to autumn levels. Inventory surplus (455 units) exists as previous high-volume orders arrived during this demand drop.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from a summer peak (Jul avg ~150) to a significantly lower autumn regime. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is 74.0 units (79, 106, 81, 67, 59, 52), and the last 3 periods show a further decline to 59.3 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 403 units, which is extremely high given the new demand levels. At a mean of ~60-70 units per period, 403 units covers over 5-6 weeks of demand. We are in a surplus state. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to allow the on-hand inventory to deplete toward the new target base stock. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods to capture the post-summer regime. The OR backend will naturally minimize ordering until the pipeline + on-hand inventory aligns with the target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for September/Autumn established: Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level post-summer peak, with a 6-period average (P25-P30) of 74.0 units compared to the July peak of ~150 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from a summer peak (Jul avg ~150) to a significantly lower and stable autumn level. Since Period 25 (late July), demand has averaged 73.0 units (Last 7 periods: 79, 106, 81, 67, 59, 52, 42). The most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) show even lower demand (59, 52, 42), averaging ~51 units, suggesting the 'cooling' is reaching a floor. On-hand inventory is currently high (361 units) due to large orders placed during the summer peak arriving during the downturn. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the new demand regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the post-peak average (~73 units/week) while allowing the excess inventory to bleed down before placing significant new orders. This targets a safer lower level while the system absorbs the existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for Autumn stabilized: 7-period average (P25-P31) is 73.0 units, a ~50% reduction from the summer peak. On-hand inventory (361) is currently sufficient for ~5 weeks of demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from a summer peak (approx. 150 units/period in July) to a stable autumn regime. For the last 8 periods (P25-P32), demand has averaged 68.3 units, with a noticeable stabilization around 50 units in the most recent 3 periods (P30-P32). The current on-hand inventory of 310 units is quite high relative to this new demand level, covering over 4-6 weeks of stock. Consequently, orders have been minimal. I am using a recent_N of 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak cooling while ignoring the extreme July spikes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from a summer peak (approx. 150 units/week in July) to a lower, stable autumn regime. Since Period 25 (late July), the mean demand has hovered around 71 units per week (P25-P33 average is 70.8). Period 33 demand was slightly higher at 74, but generally, the trend is flat. Inventory levels are currently balancing out after high-volume summer orders stopped arriving (last shipment was Period 29). We are currently in a period with 236 units on hand and 103 in-transit (from Periods 30-33). With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. 5 * 71 = 355 units. Current inventory (339) is nearly aligned with this requirement. I will use a recent_N of 9 (P25-P33) to capture this specific autumn regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it represents the most accurate post-peak environment. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed stable: Period 25 to 33 average demand is 70.8 units, representing a sustained ~50% reduction from the summer peak. Volatility has also decreased compared to the June/July period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a stable autumn regime following the summer peaks. For the last 10 periods (P25-P34), demand has averaged 67.1 units, significantly lower than the July average of ~150. Specifically, over the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34), demand has averaged 52.4 units with relatively low volatility. On-hand inventory is 196 units and in-transit is 173 units (total 369). Given the lead time (L=4) plus one review period, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. At the current 52.4 average, this suggests a safety target around 260-310 units. Our current pipeline (369) is sufficient, but we will continue to place moderate orders to maintain a stable base stock as the summer surplus clears. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized autumn demand levels and minimize holding costs while maintaining high service levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, mid-autumn. The demand for '7pk basic sneaker socks' has transitioned from its high summer peak (~150 units/week) to a stable autumn regime of approximately 55-60 units/week. Recent samples (P30-P35) show demands of 52, 42, 51, 74, 43, 65, averaging 54.5 units. The 5-period average (P31-P35) is 55.0. On-hand inventory is 166 units, and in-transit is 138 units (ordered P32-P34), totaling 304 units of pipeline inventory. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the current mean of ~55, the required base stock is approximately 275-300 units. Since our pipeline (304) already exceeds this, the OR backend will naturally taper ordering. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this lower autumn mean and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility compared to summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand for mid-September through mid-October (P31-P35) is 55.0 units, roughly 37% of the summer peak (~150).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a stable autumn regime following the summer peak (July avg ~150). For the last 12 periods (P25-P36), demand has averaged 66.8 units. More recently, in the last 6 periods (P31-P36), the average is 51.3 units, indicating a further softening as we move deeper into October. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (160) currently covers approximately 3 periods of the current demand level. In-transit inventory includes orders from P33 (38 units), P34 (73 units), and P36 (15 units), totaling 126 units. To maintain appropriate stock levels without over-ordering during this lower-demand phase, I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the most current demand mean and volatility, which better reflects the late autumn profile than the full season average.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has fully transitioned into the Autumn/Winter regime following the summer peak (July avg ~150). Since Period 35, demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level, with the last three periods (P35-P37) averaging 51 units (65, 33, 55). The current on-hand inventory of 143 units, combined with the 116 units in-transit (P34 order of 73 arriving next period, and P36/P37 orders), is more than sufficient for the next 4-5 weeks of demand. With the current inventory cushion and lower demand, I will use a recent 5-period average (P33-P37) to set mu_hat at approximately 54 units per period (multiplied by 1+L). This ensures the OR backend captures the lower autumn consumption rate without over-ordering and incurring unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand for October (P34-P37) is 49.0 units, representing a stable low-season baseline for sneaker socks compared to the early October peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has stabilized in the 'Autumn' regime. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), the average demand is 48.6 units, compared to the higher levels seen in September/early October. The current on-hand inventory is 169 units with 115 units in-transit (orders from P36, P37, and P38). With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a service level target q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, the system needs to cover approximately (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 5-period average (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat reflects the most recent stable demand regime while accounting for the lower volatility observed in October. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P34 through P38).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for Autumn confirmed: Average demand for the month of October (P34-P38) is 48.6 units, showing stability and lower volatility compared to the summer peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historical demand for the Autumn regime (Period 30 onwards) has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the summer peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 47 units, and the average for the entire Autumn period (P30-P39) is 50.0 units. On-hand inventory is 134 units with 119 in-transit, totaling 253 units of pipeline inventory. Given that (1+L) periods is 5 weeks, the current inventory level covers approximately 5 weeks of demand at the 50-unit/week average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P34-P38). To avoid excessive holding costs as demand settles into a lower winter baseline, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) to reflect the consistent Autumn demand regime of ~50 units per week. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=10) to capture the reduced volatility observed since October.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at ~50 units/week (P30-P39 average 50.0), a significant reduction from the Summer peak of ~150 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for basic sneaker socks has entered a stable autumn/winter regime. Over the last 6 periods (P35-P40), demand has averaged 45.67 units, a significant decrease from the summer peak of ~150. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P37-P40) show an average of 44 units with relatively low volatility. On-hand inventory is 110 units, and in-transit inventory is 147 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current period (N=41), the total inventory covers roughly 5-6 weeks of demand. We will use recent_N=6 to capture the stabilized late-autumn demand pattern, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this regime to avoid overstocking as we approach the end of the year (Period 47). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P34, P36, P40), so 'calculate' is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand regime confirmed: 6-period average (P35-P40) demand is ~45.7 units, significantly lower than summer peaks. Volatility has also moderated.

The 7-period average (P35-P41) is approximately 45.7 units per week, with low volatility. Although on-hand inventory (92) and in-transit units (137) seem sufficient, we must maintain a base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand to prevent stockouts if demand fluctuates slightly during the winter months. Predicted lead time remains stable at 4 periods. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 45.7 \u2248 228.5. sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility since the regime shifted (P35-P41), yielding a standard deviation of approximately 10.5 for the period, which scales to sqrt(5) * 10.5 \u2248 23.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1856.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for period 42 spiked significantly to 101 units, likely driven by the Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional period (late November). This is a sharp deviation from the mid-autumn average of ~45-50 units observed over the last several periods. Given the date (Dec 2), we are likely entering the holiday shopping season where demand for basic items like '7pk sneaker socks' often sees a secondary peak. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward volatility while still being anchored by the lower demand preceding the spike. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand plus in-transit (63+107=170) is currently covering approximately 3.4 weeks of the recent average demand (~50), which is slightly low given the lead time of 4. The backend will adjust the order to account for this deficit and the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in late November (P42 demand: 101 vs previous 5-period avg of 41), signaling the start of the holiday shopping season for basic items.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), heading into the peak holiday season. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 101, and although it dipped to 41 in Period 43, late November/early December generally sees increased volatility and spikes for basic giftable items like sneaker socks. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (confirmed by arrivals in P42 and P43). mu_hat needs to account for this seasonal increase; the last two weeks (P42-43) average 71 units, but given the proximity to mid-December and the stockouts seen during the summer peak when base stocks were too low, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for a forecasted average of 85 units per week over the next 5 periods (L+1). This ensures we build enough inventory to cover potential December surges without repeating the chronic stockouts of early summer. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent increase in volatility (range 39 to 101).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility detected: late Nov/early Dec demand shifted from ~45 to a wider range (41-101), suggesting a seasonal baseline shift to ~70-85 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the holiday shopping season (Period 45, Dec 16). After a spike to 101 units in P42 (late Nov), demand has moderated slightly (41, 45 in the last two weeks), but remains volatile compared to the autumn baseline. The 5-period average (P40-P44) is 54.4 units. Given the proximity to Christmas, we should anticipate potential single-period spikes. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (24), but the pipeline (289) contains significant orders (98, 131) placed in P43 and P44 to cover the holiday surge. Using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (approx 54.4 units/week) will set base stock relative to the current holiday demand level. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the increased holiday volatility (standard deviation of ~26).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (late Nov - Dec): Average demand has shifted from an autumn baseline of ~45 to ~55 units/week with increased volatility (range 41-101).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the December holiday shopping season (Period 46: 2019/12/23). Recent demand confirms a significant volatility spike and regime shift: Period 42 saw 101 units, Period 45 saw 64 units, and the 4-period average (P42-P45) is 62.75, compared to the previous autumn baseline of ~45. Currently, we have 0 units on-hand and 327 in-transit. A large shipment of 42 units (ordered Period 42) is expected to arrive during this period (Period 46) but won't be seen until Period 47's start. To account for holiday sales through late December and early January, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this recent elevation, and sigma_hat using the same period to account for the increased volatility (range 41-101). L remains at the promised 4-period default, as recent arrivals have been consistent with this lead time.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (late Nov-Dec) average is 62.75 (P42-P45), up ~40% from the autumn baseline of 45. Volatility has peaked with the holiday season (range 41-101).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/30, which encompasses the final peak of the holiday shopping season and transitions into the New Year. Recent history (P42-P46) shows a holiday demand regime shift with an average of 61.2 units per week and high volatility (range 41\u2013101). The product is currently stocked out (on-hand = 0) despite a 42-unit arrival in P46, as demand (55) exceeded available stock. There is a healthy in-transit pipeline of 373 units (P43-P46 orders: 98, 131, 56, 88). Given the holiday volatility and the risk of lingering stockouts, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent holiday behavior. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (late Nov-Dec) average stabilized at 61.2 units (P42-P46), a ~35% increase from the autumn baseline of 45, with higher volatility (SD ~24).
