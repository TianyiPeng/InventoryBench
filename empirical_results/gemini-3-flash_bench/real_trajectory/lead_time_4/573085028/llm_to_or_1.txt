Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 573085028 (Womens skinny high-waist jeans). Initial on-hand and in-transit inventory are zero. Historical demand from the last 5 weeks ranges between 54 and 74, with a mean of 61.6 and a standard deviation of 8.8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given this is the start and demand appears stable post-holiday, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent stable demand level. This will set the base stock to cover demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. The OR backend will compute the order based on mu_hat \u2248 5 * 61.6 = 308 and sigma_hat \u2248 sqrt(5) * 8.8 \u2248 19.7.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's skinny high-waisted denim jean, a staple item. Initial demand in Period 1 was 93 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-game samples (avg ~61.6). This suggests either a post-winter reset/spring transition demand spike or the pre-game data underrepresented the actual sales pace. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order of 77 units (placed Period 1) is in transit and not expected until Period 5 (L=4). To account for the recent demand surge, I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples plus the game's Period 1 observation (N=6 total samples). Because we have zero stock and high initial demand, setting parameters to capture the higher mean (reflected by the 93 units in P1) is critical.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand remains 0 because the first order (P1) is not expected until P5 (promised lead time L=4). P1 demand was 93 and P2 demand was 81. Historical samples (74, 54, 54, 58, 68) show an average of roughly 62, while recent operational demand (P1, P2) has spiked to an average of 87. This suggests a demand regime shift, possibly due to seasonal factors (late February) for women's denim. I will use recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat to capture this higher demand trend. For L, I will stay with default (promised L=4) as we have no 'conclude' messages to infer an actual lead time shift yet. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility without overreacting to the small sample size of two periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Madison skinny HW' (Womens Everyday Jeans) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we began ordering in Period 1, the first shipment is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales, while 283 units are in-transit. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (including pre-game samples) has averaged 61.6 units per week (74, 54, 54, 58, 68). The realized demand in Periods 1-3 was 93, 81, and 59, respectively. The average of all available points (8 samples) is 67.6. Given the stability of the 'Everyday Collection' and the lack of specific upcoming seasonal peaks in early March, I will use all 8 samples to estimate demand. With a lead time L=4, the coverage period is L+1=5. mu_hat is set to (5 * 67.6) = 338. sigma_hat will use the default standard deviation across all samples to manage volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The SKU is a pair of women's skinny jeans. Historical demand samples (Jan/Feb) averaged 61.6 units/week. In-game demand (Periods 1-4) has shown a decelerating trend: 93, 81, 59, 41 (average 68.5). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, P3, and P4 are currently in-transit (total 339 units). The P1 order (ordered P1, lead time 4) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at P6). Since no orders have concluded yet, we cannot infer actual lead time deviations. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost all demand so far due to the lead time gap. To stabilize, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=4) to capture the recent in-game mean of ~68.5, and stick to the promised lead time of 4. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 0.50 (z=0), which the OR backend will target via the base stock calculation.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a pair of women's skinny jeans, which typically has stable demand, but we should watch for spring seasonal shifts. The promised lead time is 4. In Period 5, we saw the first arrival (ordered in P1), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Our demand history includes 5 pre-game samples (mean=61.6) and 5 in-game samples (mean=68.2). The combined mean is 64.9. In Period 5, demand was 67. We currently have 10 units on hand and 266 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). The pipeline inventory (266) + on-hand (10) = 276. Given L=4, the base stock levels needed to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand at a mean of ~65 would be around 325 units. Since 276 < 325, the OR backend will likely place a replenishment order. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead time matches the promise, and 'default' for mu and sigma to incorporate all available historical data to stabilize the forecast.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU is Madison skinny HW jeans, a stable 'Womens Everyday Collection' item. Historical demand (prior to Period 1) was [74, 54, 54, 58, 68] (Mean: 61.6). Game history demand [93, 81, 59, 41, 67, 48] (Mean: 64.8). There is no strong seasonal trend apparent for late March for this staple item. Demand variability is moderate. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (as promised), with arrivals from Period 1 and 2 confirming this. Since the regime is stable, I will use all available game history (N=6) to calculate demand statistics. Profits and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a staple item (skinny jeans). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Periods 3-7) has stabilized, averaging 53.4 units per week, which is lower than the initial burst observed in Periods 1-2. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods across three consecutive arrivals (Periods 5, 6, and 7). Pipeline inventory is 157 (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), and on-hand is 116. Total inventory position is 273. With L=4, the base stock targets (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using N=5 for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) captures the current stable regime (~53.4/week) while ignoring the initial high-demand outliers. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will approximate.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a staple item (skinny jeans). Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 8 (orders from Periods 1-4). At the start of Period 9, on-hand inventory is 107 and in-transit is 101. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from P5 (4 units), P6 (49 units), and P7 (48 units). The P5 order is expected to arrive during Period 9, the P6 order in Period 10, and the P7 order in Period 11. Recent demand (last 4 periods) has stabilized around an average of 53.25 units (48, 52, 65, 48), down from the early noise. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 4-period lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the more stable recent demand trend, which results in a forecast of (1+4) * ~53 = 265 for the protection interval. This should prevent overstocking as on-hand + in-transit (208) is currently sufficient for nearly 4 periods of demand, and the OR engine will likely order a small replenishment to maintain the 5-period target.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a staple item (skinny jeans). Historical demand over the last 9 periods (post-init) fluctuates between 41 and 93, with a mean of 60.89 and a standard deviation of 16.59. The last 5 periods (since Period 5) show a slightly lower mean around 54.8. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: we have 69 on-hand and 171 in-transit (orders from P6: 49, P7: 48, P8: 0, P9: 74). The order from Period 6 is expected to arrive during the current Period 10, meaning it will be available for demand in Period 11. Since profitability and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level for the base stock calculation, which is lean. To ensure we cover demand during the lead time (L=4) plus the review period, I will use recent_N=9 to capture the full operational history while excluding the initial pre-game samples which had slightly different variance. This balances the higher early demand with the recent moderating trend.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 22nd. The product is a pair of women's denim trousers. Historical demand for the last 10 periods has averaged 58.7 units per week, with a consistent range between 40-70 units in recent weeks. There are no immediate major calendar spikes expected for this basic denim item in late April/early May. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival history of orders from Periods 1 through 6. Current inventory positions: On-hand (74) + In-transit (187) = 261 units. This pipeline needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With an average demand of ~59, 261 units provides coverage for approximately 4.4 periods, which is slightly below the target base stock. Since the demand has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the initial 5 samples (which averaged 61.6), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging 58.7). Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now consistently confirmed across 6 arrivals.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a staple item (Madison skinny jeans). Historical demand over the last 11 periods has stabilized around 58 units/period, with a slight decrease in variance compared to the initial weeks. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (matches promised). Analyzing the pipeline: we have orders from Period 8 (0 units), Period 9 (74 units), Period 10 (65 units), and Period 11 (35 units) in transit, totaling 174. On-hand is 69. Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) = 243. Given the Lead Time (L=4) plus current period coverage (L+1=5), and an average demand of ~58, we need approximately 290 units of coverage. Since holding costs and profit are equal ($1.00), the OR backend will target a 50% service level (z=0) by default, but the base stock calculation uses (1+L) periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the stable demand environment since Period 5 (averaging 53.1), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Lead time L will remain 'default' as 4 periods is consistently observed.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the expected shipment (ordered in Period 8) was 0 units. This is consistent with history as Period 8's order quantity was 0, but it resulted in an inventory stockout because demand (88) exceeded on-hand inventory (69). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on all previous arrivals. Recent demand (last 4 periods) has been somewhat volatile (44, 53, 88), with Period 12 showing a spike. Given the product is 'Womens 5-pocket jeans', it's a staple item with relatively stable demand around 50-60 units. I will use recent 12 samples for mu_hat to capture the average demand including the recent spike while smoothing out outliers. L is set to default (4). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (12) to ensure volatility is captured after the stockout.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 is currently facing a stockout with 0 units on-hand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as previously confirmed. However, a shipping disruption occurred in Period 12: the order from Period 8 (0 units) arrived as expected in Period 12, but the order from Period 9 arrived in Period 13. The current date is May 13, 2019. Historical demand data shows a mean of ~61.8 units across all periods (58, 68, 93, 81, 59, 41, 67, 48, 52, 65, 42, 44, 53, 88, 74). Recent demand (Period 12-13) has spiked to 81 units/period on average, likely due to spring/early summer seasonality for women's trousers. I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture this recent variance and slightly higher trend, while sigma_hat is also calculated from recent data to account for the increased volatility seen during the stockout period. L is fixed at 4 per historical performance.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a staple item ('Madison skinny HW' jeans). Demand has been relatively consistent between 40-90 units per week. The observed lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1-P7, P9-P10). In Period 12, P8's order (which was 0 units) resulted in an arrival of 0, creating a stockout because demand was slightly higher (88). Current on-hand is low (9). In-transit inventory (239 units) consists of orders from P11 (35), P12 (22), P13 (91), and P14 (91). The P11 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 15. Since lead time is stable at 4, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 periods (P10-P14) show a mean of 63.4, which is slightly higher than the overall average; I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this minor upward trend. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a staple item ('Womens Everyday Collection' jeans). Recent demand (Periods 12-15) show an average of 68.75 units per week, which is significantly higher than the earlier mid-regime (Periods 6-11) average of approx 50. This surge likely reflects seasonal spring/summer demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, but Period 12's order (expected Period 16 arrival) is missing from the Period 15 conclude message, though history shows arrivals occur during the period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 271 units in-transit. To avoid further stockouts given the demand increase, I will use a recent N=4 window for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher 68.75 average, and use 'calculate' for Lead Time as it has consistently been 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current pace.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 12: avg increased from ~50 to ~69 units/period (+38%) through Period 15.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 0. High demand in recent periods (since Period 12) has lead to stockouts. The carry-over insight correctly notes a demand regime shift starting Period 12; however, Period 16 demand dropped to 34, which might be a localized dip but needs monitoring. Actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio of 0.5, where the OR backend aims to cover the mean demand. Because of the stockouts and the higher recent mean (~69 units from P12-P15), I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering P12-P16) to capture the higher demand regime while including the P16 dip to moderate the forecast. L is set to 'calculate' as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18 (2019-06-10), we observe that the delivery sequence has returned to the promised lead time of 4 periods (Period 13's order arrived in Period 17). However, the order from Period 8 (ordered=0) and the lack of an order in Period 17 mean no arrivals are expected in Period 21 and Period 22 respectively. Demand has recently softened significantly (21 units in Period 17 compared to the mid-60s average in the previous regime), suggesting it is exiting the high-demand period observed between Periods 12-15. Considering the product is 'washed stretch denim jeans', demand is likely stabilizing. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the transition from the high-demand peak (avg ~70) to the current lower demand (avg ~40 recently), while retaining 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period lead time is now consistently confirmed through history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16: demand dropped from a peak average of ~69 (P12-15) to a lower level (avg ~37 in P16-17), indicating the end of the previous spike.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a staple item (skinny jeans). We have observed a confirmed lead time of 4 periods consistently. Demand history shows a recent regime shift: after a spike in May (average ~69), demand has settled into a lower level over the last three periods (P16: 34, P17: 21, P18: 38), averaging 31 units per period. I will use N=3 for \u03bc_hat to capture this recent cooldown and ensure we do not over-order based on the previous spike. With an on-hand inventory of 123 and 140 units in-transit (total 263), we are well-covered for the next 5 periods (L+1) given the current demand rate (~31 * 5 = 155). The OR backend's inventory balancing will likely place a small or zero order to prevent excess holding costs while maintaining a service level based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level (avg ~31 units/period) starting Period 16 after the May spike concluded.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical demand shows a stabilization at a lower level following a May peak. The last four periods (P16-P19) have demand values of 34, 21, 38, and 50, averaging 35.75 units per period. The Carry-over insight correctly identified a stabilization around Period 16. On-hand inventory is currently high at 140 units, with 73 units in-transit (ordered in Period 16), which is expected to arrive during this period (Period 20) based on the consistent 4-period lead time. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 213, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the current period and the 4-period lead time (roughly 35.75 * 5 = 178.75 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), maintaining excess inventory is costly. I will use a recent_N calculation for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend aims for a lower base stock to reflect the post-spike demand levels.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Demand has entered a lower, stable regime following a late spring spike. Over the last five periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 38 units (34, 21, 38, 50, 47), which is significantly lower than the ~69 units seen during the May peak. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (166 units) due to arrivals from previous high-demand orders (P13-P16) landing while demand cooled. With a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 50%, making inventory minimization a priority to avoid high holding costs. The existing on-hand inventory (166) already covers more than 4 periods of the current average demand (~38 * 4 = 152). Therefore, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent stable average using the last 5 periods (N=5) to ensure the OR engine doesn't over-order while we bleed off excess stock.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical demand shows a mid-year stabilization followed by a recent spike (79 units in Period 21), possibly reflecting a summer sale or seasonal demand for 'washed stretch denim jeans'. The demand regime shift noted in Period 19 (avg ~31 units) has been superseded by a more recent trend. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), the average demand is (34+21+38+50+47+79)/6 = 44.8 units/period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P20 conclude showing P16's order arriving at T+4). On-hand inventory is 87, and in-transit is 24 units. To maintain service levels during this potential uptick while accounting for the high holding cost (Profit=Holding=$1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current volatility and rising mean. L is set to calculate as it matches the observed 4-period lead time. This will ensure the OR backend's capped policy provides enough stock for the L+1 window without excessive overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing in July: Period 21 demand spiked to 79 compared to previous 5-period average of 38 (+107%).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's 5-pocket jeans (Womens Everyday Collection). Current Period 23 follows a significant demand spike in July (Period 21: 79 units, Period 22: 110 units), despite the previous regime average being ~31-50 units. This suggests a summer seasonal peak or promotion. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are relying on 'In-transit' units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the demand has surged to an average of ~95 over the last two periods, I will set mu_hat to reflect this higher demand level to capture the peak and avoid further stockouts, while using recent volatility for sigma_hat. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat (P20-P22) averages out as (47+79+110)/3 = ~78.7. Multiplying by (1+L) = 5, the forecasted demand across the lead period is ~393. Setting L=4 (promised/confirmed).

Carry-over insight: Significant July seasonal demand surge confirmed: Period 21-22 average demand increased to 94.5 units/period compared to June average of ~40 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 ('Madison skinny HW' trousers) is experiencing a severe July demand surge. Period 23 demand hit 141 units, bringing the July average (Periods 21-23) to 110 units/period, compared to the June average of ~40. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we are experiencing stockouts (sold 0 of demand 141 in P23). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The arrivals for Period 17, 18, 19, and 20 were 0 because no orders were placed in Periods 13 to 16 due to high starting stock at that time. However, Period 21-23 orders (24, 78, 128 units) are in-transit but won't arrive until Period 25-27. We are currently in a supply gap. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the current high-demand July regime (avg ~110, std ~31). This will set a higher base stock to recover from current stockouts and maintain service levels during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: July seasonal peak intensified: average demand for P21-P23 reached 110 units/period (previously ~40 in June). Period 23 saw a peak demand of 141.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand July period (July 29th), characterized by a significant seasonal surge that began in Period 21. Demand from Period 21 to Period 23 was 79, 110, and 141 respectively, before settling back to 77 in Period 24. This indicates a high-intensity peak. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) due to the surge, and the system is reliant on 391 units in transit (ordered in P21-P24). The actual lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P17-P20 arrivals). Our objective is to set base-stock parameters that cover the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) considering this higher regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this July surge (P21-P24), as the June average was significantly lower. This provides an average demand of 101.75 per period. The sigma will also be based on these recent 4 periods to account for the heightened volatility observed during the peak.

Carry-over insight: July seasonal surge confirmed: average demand for P21-P24 is 101.75 units/period (compared to June average of ~40). This represents a +150% increase in demand baseline for the mid-summer peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand July seasonal peak for women's denim. The last five periods (P21-P25) have seen a dramatic demand surge with an average of approximately 98.4 units/period (79, 110, 141, 77, 85), compared to the June average of ~40. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and although 485 units are in-transit, 461 of those were ordered in P22-P25 and are not expected to arrive until P26-P29. The P21 order arrived exactly on the promised 4-period lead time in P25. To capture the current high-demand regime and prevent further stockouts during this peak, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (the start of the July surge). L remains at the verified lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: July/August seasonal peak confirmed: Demand average for P21-P25 is 98.4 units/period, representing a ~145% increase from the June baseline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' 5-pocket jeans set in washed stretch denim. We are currently in mid-August (2019/08/12). Historical data shows a significant seasonal demand surge starting at Period 21 (July), which has intensified into August. Period 26 demand reached a peak of 177 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 118 units. With an on-hand inventory of 0 and demand frequently outstripping supply during this peak, we must maintain a high base stock. Actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the full trajectory of the July/August surge while balancing against the extreme spike in P26. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to account for the high volatility observed during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: August demand peak intensified: Period 26 demand reached 177 units; 5-period average (P22-P26) is 118 units, representing a ~200% increase from the June baseline (~39).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 is currently experiencing a severe late-summer demand surge (August peak). Demand has escalated rapidly from ~40 units in June to over 300 units in Period 27 (2019/8/12). Specifically, the last three periods (P25-27) show demand of 85, 177, and 311 units respectively, reflecting a hyper-growth phase. My current on-hand inventory is 0, and while 161 units (ordered P24) are expected to arrive in Period 28's arrival phase, they will likely be immediately depleted by this high demand. To manage this peak, I am aggressively increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will use the last 3 periods (the core of the August surge) to set mu_hat, which results in a localized average of 191 units/period. Over the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, this leads to an explicit mu_hat of 955. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' over the last 5 periods to capture the massive increase in volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth demand phase confirmed in August: Demand increased from 85 (P25) to 177 (P26) and 311 (P27). Current 3-period average is 191 units, a ~400% increase from the June baseline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal peak for women's denim trousers (Madison skinny jeans) in late August. Demand has exploded from a June baseline of ~40 to recent peaks of 311 (P27) and 262 (P28). The demand regime for the last 3 periods (P26-P28) average is 250 units/period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a massive pipeline of 616 units (including a 347-unit order from P28), we need to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this hyper-growth while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering if the peak subsides. We use an explicit mu_hat forecast of 1250 (calculated as (1+L) * 250 avg demand) and a high explicit sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed in August (ranging from 177 to 311).

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth demand phase stabilized in late August: Average demand for P26-P28 is 250 units/period, a significant increase from the preliminary July surge. This represents the primary annual seasonal peak for this SKU.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 30 (2019/09/02). The data shows we are dealing with a significant seasonal peak for this 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim jeans SKU, which typically corresponds with late-summer/back-to-school shopping. Demand reached a high of 311 in Period 27 and has since slightly moderated to 262 (P28) and 213 (P29). The 3-period average (P27-P29) is 262 units. Despite large orders being placed, we are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand = 0) because the rapid demand acceleration outpaced our previous stock levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. For this period, I will set mu_hat using the recent 3-period average of 262.33 multiplied by (1+L) to account for the current high-demand regime. This represents a sustained peak compared to the June baseline of ~40 units. Since volatility is also high during this shift, I'll use sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods (P25-P29) to ensure the OR backend builds a sufficient safety buffer. This approach aims to maximize sales during the peak while accepting the holding cost risk as demand eventually subsides in the fall.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand seasonal peak confirmed for late-August/early-September: 3-period average (P27-P29) stabilized at ~260 units/period, representing the SKUs primary annual peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in its primary annual seasonal peak (late August/early September). Demand over the last three periods (P28-P30) has stabilized at a high level, averaging approximately 233 units/period (262, 213, 223). The previous 'hyper-growth' phase seen in mid-August (P27 demand of 311) appears to have leveled off into a sustained high-demand plateau. On-hand inventory is depleted (0 units), and the pipeline is large (1256 units) due to aggressive ordering in recent periods (P27-P30) to catch up with the surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 26 order in Period 30. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this stabilized peak demand level (~233 * 5 = 1165). Sigma_hat is also set using N=3 to reflect current high volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the remaining peak window while accounting for the significant in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal peak demand of ~233 units/period confirmed for late-August through early-September (Periods 28-30).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 (Women's skinny jeans) has passed its primary annual seasonal peak observed in late August/early September. Demand is now cooling from the peak (P27-P30 average ~252) to a lower level (P31 demand was 137). Current date is mid-September. Comparison of the last three periods (P29-P31: 213, 223, 137) suggests a downward trend as we exit the peak summer/back-to-school season. I will use a 3-period average (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this decelerating demand quickly while maintaining enough stock for the current activity level. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 7 units on-hand and high in-transit (1112 units), including a heavy order from Period 28 (347 units) expected to arrive in Period 32 (today), the OR engine needs to carefully manage the pipeline. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 allows for a more responsive adjustment to the post-peak demand decline.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal cooling detected: Demand dropped from an average of ~252 (P27-P30) to 137 in Period 31, signaling the end of the hyper-growth summer peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal peak for this SKU (Womens Everyday 5-pocket jeans) concluded around Period 31. Demand has dropped from a peak average of ~252 (Periods 27-30) to 92 in Period 32, following 137 in Period 31. This confirms a post-peak cooling phase. Current on-hand inventory is 262, and in-transit inventory is high (765 units), including large orders from Periods 29 (361) and 30 (404). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the significant drop in demand and the large pipeline about to arrive, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 2 periods to reflect the new lower demand level (~115 units/period) and avoid excessive overstocking as the season ends. The pipeline already far exceeds several periods of current demand, so the OR engine should naturally minimize further ordering.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal cooling confirmed: Demand dropped from a late-August peak average of ~252 to ~115 (avg P31-P32), a 54% reduction.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal peak for this SKU (women's 5-pocket jeans) concluded around Period 30. Demand has dropped significantly from the late-August hyper-growth peak (avg ~252) to a much lower level. For Period 31, 32, and 33, demand was 137, 92, and 121 respectively, yielding a post-peak average of ~117 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (502 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (Period 28 and 29 orders arriving in Period 32 and 33). Another large shipment of 404 units (ordered Period 30) is expected to arrive in Period 34. Given that total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 906 units and expected demand corresponds to the new stabilized lower level (~117), no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P31-P33) to capture this post-peak stabilization. L remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed (Periods 31-33): Demand stabilized at an average of ~117 units/period, down ~54% from the late-August peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-peak seasonal cooling phase following a significant hyper-growth period in August. Demand has dropped from a peak average of ~252 units/period (Periods 27-30) to a stabilized average of ~106 units/period over the last four weeks (Periods 31-34: 137, 92, 121, 75). With the current date being October 7th, demand for this 'Everyday Collection' denim item is expected to remain at this lower baseline or possibly decrease further as the fall season progresses. Inventory is currently very high (on-hand: 831) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (404 units from Period 30 arrived in Period 34). At the current demand rate of ~100 units/period, the on-hand inventory alone covers over 8 weeks of supply, far exceeding the (L+1) requirement. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current post-peak regime and lead time to calculate to maintain the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Periods 31-34): Demand has stabilized at an average of ~106 units/period, a ~58% reduction from the late-August peak average of ~252.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the mid-October period following a significant late-summer peak. Demand in Period 35 spiked unexpectedly to 237 units after four periods of cooling (averaging ~106). This could be a secondary promotional peak or early winter shopping. I am currently holding 594 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given the high inventory and the risk of holding costs (at $1.0/unit), I need to determine if current stock covers the next 5 periods (L+1). Average demand over the post-peak period (P31-P35) including the recent spike is 132.4. Multiplying this by (1+L) = 5 periods gives a base stock target of ~662. My current on-hand is 594. While the Period 35 spike is significant, the overall trend since September has been lower than the August hyper-peak (~252). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current post-peak average including the latest spike, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility seen in Period 35. L remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Secondary demand spike detected in Period 35 (237 units) following a 4-period cooling phase (avg ~106). Monitoring to see if this represents a new sustained regime or a one-off event.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October. Historical data and recent observations show a significant secondary demand peak (P35: 237, P36: 282), following the primary late-summer peak. This aligns with typical Autumn/Fall fashion cycles for denim. The average demand over the last two periods is 259.5, which is much higher than the post-summer cooling floor (~106). Current on-hand inventory (312) plus in-transit (68) totals 380 units. With a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we must cover 5 periods of demand. Using an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the current secondary peak (avg ~260) suggests a 5-period requirement of 1300 units. My current inventory position (380) is significantly below this, requiring aggressive replenishment. I will set mu_hat to 1300 to signal the OR engine to increase the base stock and replenish before on-hand stock is exhausted by this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Secondary Autumn demand spike confirmed: Demand increased to 237 (P35) and 282 (P36), mirroring the late-August peak levels (~260 avg).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a secondary Autumn demand spike. Demand in Period 35 (237) and Period 36 (282) reached levels seen during the late-August hyper-growth peak (~260 avg). However, Period 37 saw a moderate cooling to 153 units. Given the 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim category, this likely reflects a sustained mid-autumn regime rather than a single-period anomaly. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (average of P35-37 is approx 224) to capture this higher baseline. In-transit inventory is 481, which includes orders from P36 (68) and P37 (413). Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. Since on-hand (159) plus in-transit (481) is 640, and (L+1) * 224 is 1120, additional ordering is required to maintain the base stock level for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Secondary Autumn demand spike stabilized: Average demand for P35-P37 is ~224 units/period, significantly higher than the early October cooling phase (~106 avg).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a secondary demand peak associated with autumn/early winter, with demand in Periods 35-38 averaging approximately 200 units/period (237, 282, 153, 128). While the last two weeks showed a decline from the initial spike, the average remains significantly higher than the October lull. We are entering November, which typically sustains high demand for 'Womens Everyday' denim due to seasonal transitions and promotional events. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 31) with a large pipeline (813 units) following orders placed in Periods 37 and 38. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must ensure the base stock covers demand until Period 43. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this higher autumn regime (average 200) while allowing for the standard lead time L=4. This ensures the OR backend targets a total pipeline + on-hand level that accommodates the current demand elevated state.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: Periods 35-38 average demand is ~200 units/period, representing a significant increase from the early-October cooling phase (~106 avg).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn demand peak (Periods 35-39), with an average demand of approximately 184 units/period. The most recent demand (P39) was 119, showing a slight cooling from the peak of 282, but still significantly higher than the October baseline of ~106. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 969 units. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and zero on-hand inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P35-P39) to capture this high-demand regime (average ~184), resulting in a total (1+L) base of ~920. Sigma_hat is set relatively high (explicitly at 65) to account for the high volatility seen during these seasonal spikes (e.g., jump from 128 to 237). This approach aims to replenish stock quickly to meet the current demand level while acknowledging the pipeline will soon start arriving (P36 order arrives in P40).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak (Periods 35-39) average confirmed at ~184 units/period, despite high volatility. Pipeline replenishment expected to start arriving in Period 40.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (2019/11/18). Inventory analysis: On-hand is low (8 units), but a massive pipeline of 901 units is incoming. The first batch of this replenishment (68 units from P36) arrived in P40, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. The Autumn demand spike (P35-P39) which averaged ~184 units/period has significantly cooled to 60 units in P40. This drop aligns with a post-peak cooling phase similar to what was observed after the August peak. Given the current date is mid-November, I expect demand to stabilize around a moderate level before potential holiday surges in December. I will base the forecast on the last 6 periods (P35-P40) to account for the recent spike while acknowledging the current downward trend, resulting in an average of ~163 units/period. The pipeline (901 units) comfortably covers the next (L+1=5) periods of expected demand (approx 815 units), but some safety margin is needed given recent volatility. Parameters set L=4, mu_hat using recent_N=6 (P35-P40) to capture the current regime which includes the spike and the drop, and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to account for the high variance between 282 and 60 units.

Carry-over insight: Post-Autumn spike cooling detected: Period 40 demand dropped to 60 units from an average of ~184 (P35-P39), suggesting the secondary seasonal peak has concluded. Promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (P36 arrival confirmed in P40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 573085028 has entered a post-peak cooling phase following the Autumn spike. Period 40 and 41 recorded demands of 60 and 36 respectively, confirming the downward trend noted in the carry-over insights. Historically, after significant seasonal peaks (like the late-August and October spikes), demand levels for this product category tend to stabilize at a much lower baseline. As we approach late November, I am forecasting for a lower-demand environment. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent cooling trend (Periods 39-41 average demand is ~72). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 40 and 41. On-hand inventory is healthy (385) and there is a large pipeline (488) arriving over the next few periods, so the OR backend should naturally taper ordering to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for the current lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-Autumn cooling regime confirmed: demand dropped significantly in P40 (60 units) and P41 (36 units) from the previous peak avg of ~184. Current baseline estimated at ~50-70 units/period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering December (Date: 2019/12/2). Historically, demand for this item ('Madison skinny HW' jeans) has shown significant seasonal volatility, with major peaks in August and October. Following the October peak (avg ~184), demand has entered a 'Post-Autumn cooling regime' with readings of 60, 36, and 47 (avg ~48). Current on-hand inventory is high at 670 units, following the arrival of large orders placed during the October spike. In-transit inventory consists of 156 units (ordered Period 39), expected to arrive in Period 43. Total available inventory (826 units) vastly exceeds current demand levels (~48/period). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given high holding costs (1.0) equal to profit (1.0), and the current overstock position, I will set parameters to prevent further ordering while the system absorbs existing stock. mu_hat is set to the current cooling baseline (~50) across the 5-period window (1+L), and sigma_hat reflects the recent stabilization variance.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final weeks of the simulation (Period 44 of 47). Current on-hand inventory is 591 units, which is quite high given the recent post-Autumn cooling. However, Period 43 saw a significant demand spike to 235 units (Date: 12/2), likely related to early December/holiday shopping. Given the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 44) would only arrive in Period 48, which is after the game ends (Period 47). Therefore, the objective shifts to utilizing existing on-hand inventory to meet remaining demand while avoiding further holding costs. No new orders are needed as the current 591 units on-hand far exceed the expected total demand for the final 4 periods (P44-47), even if the December spike continues (estimated ~235 units/period x 4 periods = 940, but historical averages suggest it may stabilize lower). By setting base stock parameters that result in zero orders, we maximize profit by avoiding additional procurement and minimizing terminal holding costs.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand spike detected: Period 43 demand increased to 235 units from a 3-period average of ~48 units (+390%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $149.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak. Demand in Period 43 was 235 and spiked further to 370 in Period 44. Based on the previous seasonal pattern observed in August/September, these peaks can last 3-4 periods before cooling. With the game ending in Period 47, we have 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47). Currently, we have 221 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. An order placed now (P45) with a lead time of 4 periods would arrive in Period 49, which is after the game ends. Therefore, we should not place any new orders as they will only contribute to pipeline inventory costs without the possibility of being sold. My objective is to manage the remaining 221 units to maximize sales in the final periods while avoiding unnecessary holding costs from new orders. Parameters are set to ensure the OR engine's 'base stock - pipeline' logic results in a zero order.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand spike intensified: Period 44 demand reached 370 units, following 235 in Period 43. This confirms a high-velocity end-of-year seasonal peak similar in scale to the August peak.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing a major December holiday demand spike, consistent with the annual peak observed in August. Demand in Period 43 was 235, Period 44 was 370, and Period 45 was 293 (average ~300). On-hand inventory is depleted to 0. Although 460 units were ordered in Period 45 and are in-transit, they will not arrive until Period 49 (Lead Time = 4). However, as we approach late December (Period 46 is Dec 23), demand typically drops sharply after Christmas/Boxing Day based on retail patterns. To avoid massive overstocks similar to what occurred after the August and October peaks (where on-hand surged to 800+ units), I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the high current velocity (avg ~300), which will result in a base stock that accounts for the current spike while the pipeline (460 units) fills the immediate gap. I am maintaining the reliable L=4.

Carry-over insight: December holiday peak confirmed: Period 43-45 average demand is ~299 units/period, matching the scale of the late-August seasonal peak.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the late stages of a December holiday spike, with demand averaging ~299 units/period over the last three weeks (P43-P45), though P46 saw a drop to 162. Given the date is 2019/12/30, we are transitioning from the peak into the typical January cooling phase (evident in the initial data samples where Jan demand was ~50-70). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a large pipeline of 871 units (ordered P45-P46) expected to arrive in Periods 49 and 50. Since lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will set L to 'default'. For demand (mu_hat), utilizing the last 4 periods (P43-P46) captures the high-velocity holiday average (~265) to ensure the OR backend accounts for potential late-December/early-January momentum while the pipeline is still in transit. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the extremely high volatility observed during this seasonal peak (ranging from 162 to 370). This approach prevents stockouts during the tail of the peak while relying on the existing heavy pipeline to cover the transition to the lower January regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday cooling expected: Historical data (Jan 2019) shows demand returning to base levels of ~50-70 units after the December peak.
