Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'DEXTER TANK', a sports vest top. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 194 units per week, with a noticeable downward trend from 270 to 137. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to establish a baseline order to cover the lead time (L) plus the review period (1). Given the recent decline in demand, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 to capture the mean demand of ~194 units per week, leading to a mu_hat of approximately 970 (194 * (4+1)). The OR backend will calculate the base stock level and place the initial order. No lead time data is available yet, so I will rely on the promised lead time (default).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the product description (Dexter Tank, sports vest top) and the date, we are approaching the spring/summer fitness season. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (ending Feb 4) was: 270, 196, 180, 187, 137. Period 1 demand was significantly lower at 84, suggesting a potential short-term cooling or variance before the seasonal climb. However, the last 4 weeks of historical data show a shift from the high 200s to the high 100s. I will use a recent_N (N=4) of historical data plus the current period (so N=5 total) to capture this most recent demand regime of ~150-180 units/week. Lead time is promised at 4; there is no evidence yet to suggest otherwise since the P1 order isn't due until P5. On-hand is currently 0, with 274 units in transit from P1. I'll maintain the promised L to ensure the OR engine calculates base stock for a 5-period window (L+1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a sports vest top. Historical demand data shows values around 180-270 in January, but recent concluded periods (P1, P2) show lower customer demand of 84 and 121. Despite this lower actual demand, our inventory position is critical: we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost all sales so far (sold=0). There are 508 units in-transit (274 from P1, 234 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the P1 order was placed in P1, we expect it to arrive during P5 and be visible in the P6 START observe phase. We are currently stocked out and must rely on the OR backend's base-stock logic to bridge the gap until first arrival. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent trend including the pre-game samples (270, 196, 180, 187, 137) and the actuals (84, 121), though the backend only uses the provided sample list for calculation. Given the stockout, I'll use the default lead time (4) and use recent_N=5 for sigma to account for volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a 'Ladies H&M Sport' vest top. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 177 units per week (samples: 270, 196, 180, 187, 137), but recent periods in-game (P1-P3) have shown slightly lower demand (84, 121, 108), averaging 104 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 4, the first order placed in Period 1 (with L=4) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 721 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Using the default lead time (4) and recent_N for mu_hat (N=3) to account for the current demand levels (avg ~104). The sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient for (4+1)=5 periods of demand while waiting for the first shipment to land.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a 'DEXTER TANK' sports vest top. The historical demand average is approximately 188 (based on provided samples), but the recent demand in the game (Periods 1-4) is lower, averaging 112.25. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect it to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 721 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, P3). In Period 4, the OR engine capped the order at 0 because the pipeline inventory already exceeded the safety stock thresholds calculated by its internal default logic. Since we are moving into spring/summer for a sports tank top, demand is likely to stay steady or increase. I will use recent_N=4 to reflect the actual in-game demand levels (avg 112) rather than the higher pre-game samples (avg 188), which prevents over-ordering while waiting for the first shipment to arrive. Lead time remains at the default (promised) 4 periods as no shipments have concluded yet to suggest a drift.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a sports vest top. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) were high (avg ~214), but recent actual demand in-game (Periods 1-5) has been lower, averaging 118.2 units per period. The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Using L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 periods (5 periods). The OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to determine the base stock level (target inventory). Given the consistency in demand over the last 5 periods (84, 121, 108, 136, 142), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this current regime, which is lower than the pre-game samples but shows an upward trend as spring approaches. This will set a target around 118 * 5 = 590 units. Current on-hand (132) + in-transit (447) = 579, which is close to the target, so the OR backend will place a small supplemental order if needed to maintain high service levels for this high-margin (Profit $19 vs Holding $1) item.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is a 'DEXTER TANK', a sports vest top. Historically, demand was higher in January (avg ~200) relative to the recent periods (avg ~120 since 2019-02-04). Specifically, the last 4 periods have shown demand of 136, 142, 128, and a steady decline if including the initial sample dates. However, the last 5 samples (P1-P5 conclude) have a mean of 119.8. Transitioning into Spring (late March), sports apparel like vest tops often see a seasonal uptick. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand is 238, with 311 in-transit (orders from P3 and P6). Total pipeline is 549. To prevent stockouts during a potential spring rise while respecting the OR cap, I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma to capture the lower recent mean (which helps avoid excessive holding costs from the high Jan figures) but remain sensitive to the 4-period lead time. N=5 covers the stabilized demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6). Demand regime stabilized around 110-140 units/period since February.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a sports tank top. Historically, demand was higher in Jan (avg 204), but since Feb (Period 1), it has stabilized into a lower regime. Last 5 periods (P3-P7): 108, 136, 142, 128, 145 (Mean: 131.8, Std Dev: 14.5). Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Pipeline Inventory is 306 (on-hand) + 233 (in-transit: P6 order of 98 + P7 order of 135) = 539 units. With L=4, we need coverage for 5 periods (L+1). A base stock calculation of 5 * 132 + Z * sqrt(5) * 14.5 (at 95% service level) suggests a target around 715 units. Given we have 539 in pipeline, we are currently under-stocked for the 5-period window. I will use recent_N=5 (covering the stable Feb/Mar period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current demand regime and default for Lead Time since it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a loose-fitting sports vest top. Historical demand data from early 2019 (Jan-Feb) showed high volumes (137-270), but settled into a stable regime from Period 1 to Period 8, averaging approximately 130 units per week (min 84, max 148). The last 4 periods (P5-P8) show a slight upward trend (142, 128, 145, 148), likely reflecting spring seasonality for sports apparel. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). No arrival occurred in P8 because no order was placed in P4. We have 158 units on hand and 390 in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8). Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 8 game samples (N=8) to capture the current stable-but-trending regime, while using recent volatility for sigma_hat to maintain a safe service level during this growth phase.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The product is a sports vest top. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (Periods 5, 6, 7) confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. The demand for the last 5 periods (P5-P9) has been 142, 128, 145, 148, and 80. The drop to 80 in Period 9 might be a fluctuation or an early sign of a shift, but the previous four weeks were very stable around 140. Using recent_N=5 captures this recent history. For lead time, 'default' matches our observed '4' periods. On-hand inventory is 78 with 504 in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for Period 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 (L+1=5 periods).

Demand for the 'DEXTER TANK' (sportswear) has shown a recent decline in the last three weeks (80, 60, and a lower sample mean than previous periods), potentially indicating a shift from the mid-Feb to March regime. To account for this recent deceleration while maintaining enough safety stock for potential late-Spring demand spikes typical for sportswear, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the trend of the last 5 periods (P6-P10 mean demand \u2248 112, compared to the earlier Jan/Feb mean). Sigma_hat will use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted: Period 8-10 showed a cooling trend (mean ~96) compared to Period 1-7 (mean ~123). Monitoring if this is a temporary dip or a new sustained lower level.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019/4/29). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P10, and P11). On-hand inventory is 180, with 457 units in the pipeline. Demand has shown a distinct cooling trend starting in Period 9. The average demand for Periods 1-8 was 134 units, while the average for Periods 9-11 is 70.3 units (80, 60, and 71 respectively). This represents a decrease of approximately 47%. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to overweight this recent lower-demand regime while maintaining some buffer for volatility. Given the 180 units on-hand and the large pipeline (457), and the lower demand trend, the capped OR policy should naturally limit new ordering to avoid high holding costs while the excess pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 9-11 mean is ~70 units, down from ~134 units (P1-P8). This reflects a cooling trend in the workout vest category as we move further into spring.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the 'DEXTER TANK' (workout vest) is showing a confirmed lower demand regime as we move into May. The demand over the last four periods (P9-P12) has been 80, 60, 71, and 83 units, averaging approximately 73.5 units per period. This is a significant drop from the earlier average of ~134 units. The lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, and P8. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 254 units, and there are 300 units in-transit (from orders in P9, P10, and P11). Given the current demand of ~74 units and a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1), which is approximately 370 units. Since our total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 554 units, we are significantly overstocked for the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to align order logic with the current lower demand trend and prevent further overstocking during this cooling period.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P9-P12) mean is 73.5 units, confirming a sustained ~45% drop from early spring peaks (~134).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. The product 'DEXTER TANK' (a workout vest) has settled into a lower demand regime as we move into late spring, likely reflecting the end of the initial spring workout surge. The last 5 periods (P9-P13) show an average demand of 78 units (80, 60, 71, 83, 96). While P13 saw a slight uptick to 96, the overall trend is significantly lower than the P1-P8 peak (~134). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P10-P13 arrivals). We have 272 units on-hand and 186 units in-transit (from P10 and P11 orders). Total pipeline inventory is 458. With an expected demand of ~78 units/period, we have enough stock to cover roughly 5.8 periods. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N (N=5) to capture this stabilized lower regime, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on high early-season averages. Lead time is set to default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level: P9-P13 mean is 78 units, down from ~134 (P1-P8).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 20, 2019. The 'DEXTER TANK' is in a lower demand regime compared to the early spring peak. Demand for the last 6 periods (P9-P14) has averaged 80.3 units (80, 60, 71, 83, 96, 92), confirming the shift noted in previous carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 345 units and recent weekly demand around 80-90 units, we have approximately 4 weeks of stock already on hand. In-transit inventory of 21 units (ordered Period 11) is expected to arrive next period. Considering the current on-hand stock and the lower demand trend, I am using recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current regime to avoid over-ordering while maintaining the 95% service level logic for current safety stock needs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a workout vest ('DEXTER TANK'). Demand has stabilized at a lower level since early April (Period 9). Looking at the history from Period 9 to Period 15, the demand values are [80, 60, 71, 83, 96, 92, 75]. The mean of this recent regime (N=7) is approximately 79.6 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple consecutive arrivals. Currently, On-hand is 291 and In-transit is 85, totaling 376 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. 5 periods * ~80 units = 400 units. Since 376 < 400, a small top-up order is likely appropriate, though the OR backend's inventory cap based on variance will dictate the final order size. To accurately reflect the current environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (the start of the lower demand regime).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1369.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Dexter Tank has stabilized at a lower level since early April (Period 9), likely due to the shift from early spring fitness shopping to summer sportswear patterns. Over the last 8 periods (P9-P16), the mean demand is approximately 80 units, compared to the earlier high-activity period (P1-P8) which averaged over 130. Lead times remain perfectly consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory plus in-transit stock totals 361 units. Given the target service level (q=0.95), we should plan for approximately 5 periods of demand (L+1). A mean demand of 80/period implies a base stock target near 400. Using 'recent_N' with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will prioritize the current stable regime while excluding the high-volume noise from earlier months.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a sports vest top. We are in a lower-demand regime compared to the early spring peak. Observed demand over the last 9 periods (P9-P17) has averaged approximately 83 units, which is notably lower than the ~134 units seen in P1-P8. Recent demand (P17) showed a slight uptick to 109 units, but it's too early to declare a new regime shift back to high demand. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (validated through P15). Currently, we have 99 units on-hand and 235 units in-transit (P15: 85, P16: 68, P17: 82). Given the promised lead time L=4, my parameters cover the (L+1)=5 window. Using the recent 9-period regime (P9-P17) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat accounts for the current seasonal cooling while providing enough safety stock to handle the recent minor volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P9-P17) with a mean of 83 units, reflecting a post-peak spring/summer level. Lead time consistency at 4 periods remains solid.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a loose-fitting workout tank top (Ladies H&M Sport). Demand has stabilized since Period 9 (early April) at a lower level compared to the spring peak. For Periods 9 through 18, the average demand is 84.1 units per period. The most recent three periods (P16-P18) show a slight uptick (83, 109, 92), with a 3-period mean of 94.6. Given we are in mid-June (summer season in the Northern Hemisphere), demand for gym vests is expected to remain stable or slightly increase due to warm weather. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (7 units) while in-transit inventory is high (342 units). Because in-transit stock covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate (342 / 85 \u2248 4), the priority is maintaining a steady pipeline without overstocking and incurring holding costs ($1/unit). I will use the recent 10-period demand mean (P9-P18) of ~84 units to set mu_hat for the (L+1) horizon, as this reflects the established post-peak regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is currently in a summer demand phase. Current inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, and we experienced lost sales in Period 19 (demand 128 vs 92 available). Demand has shown a slight uptick recently, with the last 4 periods averaging 103 units, which is higher than the previous low-regime average (~83). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the Period 15 arrival. Pipelines are full (364 units), but we must ensure future stock levels are sufficient to prevent further stockouts as demand stabilizes at this slightly higher summer level. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this minor seasonal lift and maintain L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime lift detected: P16-P19 mean increased to 103 units from previous baseline of 83 (+24%). Stockout observed in P19 due to demand spike.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is currently in a summer demand lift (July 1st). Recent demand (P17-P20) has averaged around 100 units, significantly higher than the previous spring/summer baseline of 80-83. However, P20 saw a dip to 71 units, which might be volatility. Due to the Lead Time (L=4), we are currently managing a stockout (on-hand is 0) despite having a large pipeline (432 units). The stockout in P19 and P20 was caused by orders from P15 and P16 arriving (85 and 68 units) which were insufficient to cover the demand spikes. We expect arrivals in P21 (from P17: 82 units) and P22 (from P18: 107 units). To address the recent volatility and the return to summer activity, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 5-period average (approx 98.6 per period * 5 = 493) to capture the higher mean compared to the long-term average, and setting sigma_hat using the same window to account for recent spikes like the 128 units in P19.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is currently in the summer season (July). Significant volatility is observed: Period 19 saw a spike to 128 units, while Period 21 dropped to 42 units. This creates a challenging 'sawtooth' demand pattern. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 87.5 units, which is higher than the early June baseline of 83. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (40 units) following two periods of stockouts (P19, P20), though a large pipeline of 484 units is in transit. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for recent high-demand peaks, I am using the average demand from the last 6 periods (N=6) to set mu_hat, providing enough safety stock to handle spikes like the one seen in Period 19, while balancing against the lower demand seen last week.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in July: Period 19 saw 128 units while Period 21 saw 42 units. Average demand for P16-P21 is ~88 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), we are in mid-summer for the 'DEXTER TANK' (a performance vest top). Demand in July has been highly volatile (Period 19: 128 units, Period 21: 42 units, Period 22: 25 units). The recent average demand for the last 4 periods (P19-P22) has dropped to approximately 66 units, significantly lower than the June peak. This suggests a seasonal tapering as the primary summer buying season for sports gear stabilizes or starts to decline. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 122 units, and pipeline inventory is healthy at 401 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the system targets a high service level, but we must account for the recent volume drop to avoid excessive holding costs as seasonality shifts. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current cooling trend while maintaining recent_N=10 for volatility (sigma_hat) to protect against the high variance observed in June/July.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed in July: P19-P22 average demand is ~66 units, down from the June average of ~103 units. Volatility remains high.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is experiencing a significant demand cooling trend in July. Period 23 demand was 36 units, following 25 units in Period 22 and 42 units in Period 21. This contrasts sharply with the June average of ~100 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P19-P23) is approximately 60.4 units, but the most recent three periods suggest a lower level around 35-40 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (193 units) relative to recent demand, and there is a significant pipeline of 294 units scheduled to arrive. This pipeline inventory (ordered in P20-P22) was based on earlier, higher demand estimates. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this declining phase, I am reducing mu_hat by using a recent_N of 5 to capture the downward trend, while maintaining cautious lead time parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend floor detected: P21-P23 demand mean dropped to 34.3 units, significantly lower than the P19-P22 average of 66 units. Current pipeline is likely heavily over-provisioned for this new late-summer baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is currently experiencing a sustained demand decline as we move deeper into late July. The average demand for the last four periods (P21-P24) is approximately 33 units, which is a sharp drop from the early summer average of ~100 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 300 units and there are 158 units in-transit (ordered in P21 and P22). With a total pipeline of 458 units and expected demand hovering around 33 units per period, the system is significantly over-provisioned (covering ~13 periods of demand). To prevent further accumulation of holding costs and stop the OR backend from placing more orders, I am updating mu_hat to reflect this recent low-demand regime using N=4. This will signal the OR engine that the target base stock should be much lower than the current inventory level.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-summer demand decline confirmed (P21-P24): mean demand dropped to 33 units, representing a ~65% decrease from June peaks.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is in a clear end-of-season decline as we enter August (Period 26). Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower baseline, with the last five periods (P21-P25) averaging ~30.6 units (42, 25, 36, 29, 21), a sharp drop from the June peak. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 413 units, which is approximately 13-14 weeks of supply at current demand levels. There is an additional 24 units in transit (ordered P22, due P26 conclude). Given the holding cost of $1.0/unit and the significant overstock, no further orders are required. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (last 5 periods) and keep lead time at the confirmed 4 periods. The OR backend's capped policy and the high inventory level will result in zero new orders, minimizing further holding cost accumulation.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is in a clear late-summer demand decline. Recent demand observations (P21-P26) are: 42, 25, 36, 29, 21, 12. This shows a consistent downward trend with the most recent sample hitting a low of 12 units. The current on-hand inventory of 425 units is massive relative to this new demand regime. Even at a conservative estimate of 25-30 units per week, the current stock covers over 14 weeks of supply, far exceeding the lead time of 4 periods. Since the inventory is already over-provisioned (in-transit is 0, but on-hand is extremely high), the goal is to stop ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the low-demand regime seen since July (approx. mean of 27.5). The OR backend's capping mechanism and the high current inventory level will result in zero new orders, which is the correct financial move to minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline intensified in August: Period 26 demand reached a series low of 12 units. The late-summer demand floor (P21-P26) now averages ~27.5 units/period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Ladies H&M Sport' loose-fitting sports vest top. Current date is August 19, 2019. Historical data and recent observations confirm a significant seasonal decline in demand as the summer season ends. The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P21-P27) is approximately 26 units, a sharp drop from the spring/early summer levels (~80-130 units). The current on-hand inventory of 407 units is extremely high relative to this new demand floor (covering over 15 periods of demand at current rates). The pipeline is empty, which is appropriate given the overstock situation. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Parameters are set to reflect this lower demand regime (N=7 for mu_hat) to prevent further unnecessary ordering while the system works through existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand floor (P21-P27) confirmed at ~26 units/period, down ~70% from June peaks. Heavy overstock (400+ units) exists relative to current demand velocity.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678692001 (sports vest top) is currently in a significant late-summer demand slump. Period 28 demand hit a series low of 8 units. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P21-P28) is approximately 23.8 units, while the very recent 4-period mean (P25-P28) has dropped further to 14.7 units. With an on-hand inventory of 399 units and zero in-transit, the current stock covers over 25 periods of demand at the recent average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The priority is to avoid any further orders and minimize holding costs. By setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 (capturing the latest demand floor of ~15 units), the base stock will be approximately (1+4) * 15 = 75 units. Since 399 (on-hand) is much greater than 75, the backend OR engine will correctly skip ordering. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to reflect the lowered volatility of this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor update: P25-P28 mean demand has dropped to 14.7 units, indicating the end-of-season decline is steeper than previously estimated. Current on-hand inventory (399) is extremely high relative to this run rate.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is experiencing a deep end-of-season demand decline as we enter September. Recent demand (P25-P29) has averaged 13.6 units/period, a significant drop from the mid-summer average. Current on-hand inventory is 390 units, which represents nearly 29 periods of cover based on recent demand. No orders have been placed since Period 22, and no inventory is in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the extremely high inventory levels (390 units) relative to current demand velocity, the backend OR policy will naturally result in zero orders. I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the recent demand 'floor' and ensure the OR logic does not over-order based on high historical spring averages.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor confirmed (P25-P29): mean demand is 13.6 units/period, down from the early-August average of ~26. Inventory levels (390) are extremely high relative to this run rate.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (DEXTER TANK workout vest) is at the clear end of its seasonal lifecycle as evidenced by the date (September 9th) and the sustained collapse in demand. Demand over the last 5 periods has been 21, 12, 18, 8, 9, and 6, averaging approximately 12.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory is massively bloated at 384 units, which, at the current run rate, represents over 30 periods of supply\u2014well beyond the remaining game duration. There is no pipeline inventory. The priority remains to stop all ordering to minimize further holding costs while selling through the existing stock. I will continue using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for demand (covering the clear end-of-season floor) and 'calculate' for lead time, which ensures the OR backend sees a very low base stock, effectively resulting in zero orders due to the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand collapse confirmed (P26-P30): mean demand has plummeted to 10.6 units/period. On-hand inventory represents >30 periods of supply.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (DEXTER TANK workout vest) is experiencing an end-of-season demand collapse as we enter mid-September. Demand has fallen from ~134 units in spring to just 2 units in Period 31. The current on-hand inventory of 382 units is extremely high, representing nearly a year's worth of supply at current demand rates (~10 units/period). To stop the OR backend from placing any further orders, I will continue to signal the lowest possible demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) and maintain the default lead time (confirmed at 4 periods). Setting N=5 for demand captures the recent 'collapse' regime (averaging ~8.6 units/period). Given the massive overstock, the priority is to liquidate inventory and incur holding costs rather than ordering more.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand collapse confirmed (P27-P31): mean demand has reached a floor of ~8.6 units/period, down from ~26 units in early August. On-hand inventory (382) is massive relative to this velocity.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the DEXTER TANK (a summer vest top) has effectively reached zero as we move into late September (Date: 2019/9/23). Recent demand figures for Periods 31 and 32 are only 2 units each, confirming a total end-of-season collapse. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 380 units, which is enough to cover over 100 periods at the current velocity. No further replenishment is needed for the remainder of the year. To prevent the OR backend from placing any accidental replenishment orders, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to explicit low values reflecting the current 2-unit-per-week trend. This drastically lowers the base stock target well below the current 380 units on-hand, ensuring the order quantity remains zero.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor confirmed (P31-P32): demand has dropped to 2 units/period, signifying the complete cessation of seasonal demand for this SKU.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Dexter Tank) has reached the end of its seasonal lifecycle as identified in previous periods. Demand has plummeted from spring peaks of ~134 units/period to a negligible floor of ~2-5 units/period in late September. Current on-hand inventory is 375 units, which at the current demand rate of roughly 3 units/period, represents over 120 weeks of supply. No additional orders are needed. To prevent the OR backend from placing any replacement orders, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to explicit low values that reflect this end-of-season state. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals, though it is currently irrelevant given the overstock situation.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (loose-fitting sports vest top) has entered a definitive end-of-season phase. Demand has collapsed from summer peaks to near-zero levels (mean of 2.8 units over the last 5 periods). On-hand inventory stands at 372 units, which represents over 100 periods of supply at the current consumption rate. No additional orders are needed, and the goal is to minimize further holding costs by letting inventory naturally deplete. Parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand floor: L remains at the promised 4 periods, mu_hat is set to the recent average (N=5) to capture the current low-velocity regime, and sigma_hat is set using the same window to acknowledge low volatility.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor confirmed: P30-P34 mean demand is 3.6 units/period, essentially terminating the seasonal cycle for this SKU.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (DEXTER TANK) is at the end of its seasonal lifecycle, with demand having collapsed from summer peaks to near-zero levels. Period 35 recorded 0 demand units. The current on-hand inventory of 372 units is extremely excessive, representing several years of supply at the current run rate (~3 units per period). No further orders should be placed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window to reflect this terminal demand floor. The OR backend will see that on-hand inventory vastly exceeds the computed base stock, resulting in a zero order while minimizing further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand has reached a absolute floor (P31-P35 mean = 2.4 units), with the most recent period showing zero demand. SKU is essentially dormant as the season concludes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (DEXTER TANK) is at the end of its seasonal cycle, as evidenced by the extremely low demand recorded over the last 10 periods (P27-P36). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 3.2 units per period. With current on-hand inventory at 366 units and in-transit inventory at 0, the store holds more than 100 periods of supply based on the current run rate. No further orders are needed for the remainder of the simulation. I will continue to use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to reflect this absolute floor in demand and prevent any automated replenishment, as the on-hand stock vastly exceeds the computed base stock level.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Dexter Tank' (workout vest/tank top), which is a highly seasonal item. As of Period 38 (late October), demand has essentially ceased, as evidenced by the last 8 periods showing demand ranging from 0 to 6 units (P30-P37 mean = 3.1). On-hand inventory is 365 units with zero in-transit, which covers more than 100 periods of current demand. The objective is to minimize holding costs while the game enters its final 10 periods (until Period 47). I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to their lowest possible levels using the most recent 5 periods (P33-P37 mean = 3.0) to prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods but is effectively irrelevant due to the massive overstock.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season dormancy confirmed: P33-P37 mean demand is 3.0 units. Inventory (365 units) is sufficient for the remainder of the year.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'DEXTER TANK', a seasonal sports vest. As of Period 39 (early November), the SKU remains in an end-of-season dormant state. Demand over the last 8 periods (P31-P38) has averaged approximately 3.1 units per period. With 359 units on-hand and zero in-transit, the current inventory level represents over 100 weeks of stock at the current run rate. There is no risk of stockout for the remainder of the year. To prevent further orders being triggered by the OR backend, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P34-P38 mean \u2248 3.2), which will result in a base stock significantly lower than the current inventory + pipeline. This ensures the system remains in a 'no order' state while minimizing unnecessary holding risk.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (DEXTER TANK workout vest) is deep in its off-season dormancy, which began in late summer/early autumn (around Period 33). Current demand is extremely low, averaging only ~3 units over the last 10 periods (P30-P39). The on-hand inventory of 357 units is massive relative to this near-zero demand velocity, representing well over 100 weeks of supply at the current run rate. Consequently, no new orders are necessary. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 periods as observed consistently. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current dormant demand state (mean ~3), which ensures the base stock calculation remains significantly below our current massive on-hand inventory, preventing any further procurement and minimizing additional holding costs while the remaining season concludes.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (DEXTER TANK) is in a clear end-of-season dormancy phase. In Period 41 (mid-November), demand remains extremely low, with a mean of 3.0 units over the last 10 periods (P31-P40). Current on-hand inventory is 354 units, which at the current run rate, covers over 100 periods of demand. This far exceeds the remaining 7 periods in the simulation (total 47 periods). The objective is to minimize holding costs while maintaining a minimal service level for these trace sales. I will set mu_hat to a very low explicit value based on the recent average to prevent further ordering, and use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the historical 4-period stability, although no new orders will be triggered by the OR backend given the massive inventory surplus.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (DEXTER TANK) is a seasonal sports vest currently in a state of dormancy as of late November. Period 42 starts with an on-hand inventory of 352 units, while the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P32-P41) is only 3.0 units. Given that there are only 6 periods remaining in the simulation (through Period 47), the current inventory represents over 100 periods of supply. The primary goal is to minimize further holding costs by avoiding any new orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical data. I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=10 to reflect the current low-demand dormancy period, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the low volatility of this floor. This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than the current on-hand inventory, ensuring the OR backend places no new orders.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is in its end-of-season dormancy phase (Period 43, December 2nd). Demand has remained consistently low since late September, with the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P33-P42) being approximately 3.1 units per period. The current on-hand inventory of 348 units is excessive, covering over 100 periods of supply at the current run rate. Consequently, no new orders are required. To prevent any further automated ordering by the backend, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to reflect the current low-demand environment, and use the default lead time (4 periods). This provides the OR backend with a very low base-stock target, ensuring the order remains $0.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season dormancy continues through December (P33-P42): mean demand is 3.1 units/period. Inventory (348) massively exceeds remaining seasonal requirements.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies sport vest top) is in a state of late-season dormancy as of early December (Period 44). Historical data from Period 35 onwards shows demand has flattened significantly, with a mean of approximately 2.8 units per period over the last 9 weeks. Current on-hand inventory is 347 units, which is enough to cover more than 100 periods at the current velocity. Given that the game ends in Period 47, no further orders are necessary. Parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand floor to ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders while we wind down inventory. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Dexter Tank) is currently in a deep winter dormancy phase, with demand averaging approximately 2-3 units per period. We are at Period 45, very close to the end of the simulation (Period 47). On-hand inventory is 344 units, which is enough to cover more than 100 periods of demand at the current run rate. There is no risk of stockout; the primary objective is to minimize further holding costs by avoiding any new orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set based on the recent extremely low-demand regime (last 10 periods) to reflect the end-of-season status and ensure the OR backend's order calculation stays at zero.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'DEXTER TANK' workout vest. We are currently in Period 46 (December 23, 2019), which is the deep off-season for this category. Historical demand since Period 33 (late September) has been extremely low, averaging only ~2.8 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 343 units, which provides over 100 periods of supply at this run rate. The inventory is significantly over-provisioned for the remainder of the year. No additional orders are needed. Parameters are set to reflect this near-dormant demand state (mean ~3 units/period) to guarantee zero ordering while maintaining a realistic statistical profile for the backend.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season dormancy continues through late December: mean demand (P33-P45) is 2.8 units/period. On-hand inventory represents excessive safety stock for the winter months.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-323.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (loose-fitting sports vest top) remains in an end-of-season dormancy phase as of December 30, 2019. Demand has been consistently low since Period 33, averaging approximately 2.8 units per period over the last 14 weeks. Current on-hand inventory is 342 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents over 100 periods (nearly two years) of supply. There are no units in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to current sales velocity, the priority is to avoid any further procurement. The OR backend will naturally calculate a zero order quantity because the on-hand inventory (342) significantly exceeds the base stock level derived from a mu_hat based on recent low demand. I am setting L to the promised 4 periods, and mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) to reflect the current stagnant demand regime and ensure no orders are triggered.
