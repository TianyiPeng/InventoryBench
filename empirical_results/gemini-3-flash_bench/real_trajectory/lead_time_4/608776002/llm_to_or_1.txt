Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 'Scallop 5p Socks' is a women's staple item. Historical demand from the last 5 weeks averages 229.4 units per week (min: 190, max: 294). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish an initial pipeline. Using all historical samples (N=5) provides a robust starting point. The target service level defined by the OR engine's logic (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5) implies the base stock will be roughly the median demand; however, the backend's capped policy will ensure we don't over-order. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize the available history and promised lead time to set the initial order.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Examining the history, the demand in Period 1 was 233, following a historical sample set (196, 255, 294, 212, 190). The average demand across these 6 points is approx 230. The product is 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge', a staple item with relatively stable demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, 303 units were ordered (appearing as in-transit), but since the lead time is >= 1, they did not arrive by the end of Period 1. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 303 in-transit. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting (mu_hat) with N=5 to capture recent trends, and 'default' for lead time and sigma_hat since there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods or that volatility has shifted significantly from the baseline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. This SKU (Womens Socks) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, no orders placed in Period 1 or 2 are expected yet (earliest arrival would be Period 5). Our history shows consistent demand (mean ~230). The initial demand samples (196-294) plus the two game periods (233, 271) suggest a stable demand regime. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 605 units in-transit. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5. Given the product category 'Womens Nightwear/Socks', February demand is likely steady without immediate major holiday spikes. I will use recent_N to capture the slightly higher demand seen in recent weeks (the last 5 samples: 212, 190, 233, 271 have a mean of ~226.5 vs the overall mean). However, the default 'all sample' mean is safer given the low service level target. I'll use N=7 (covering available history) to stabilize the forecast around the current mean while accounting for recent volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge.' The date is early March. Looking at the historical demand (Jan: 196, 255, 294, 212; Feb: 190, 233, 271, 174), demand is relatively stable but fluctuates between 174 and 294. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (P1), Period 2 (P2), and Period 3 (P3) are all currently in-transit (303+302+301 = 906 units). Following the lead time rule (N+L), the P1 order placed at the start of Period 1 with L=4 should arrive during Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we have had significant lost sales (stockouts) since Period 1 because starting inventory was 0 and no shipments have arrived yet. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 8 weeks (approx. 228 per week) to cover the 5-week window (L+1). L is set to default (4). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=8 to capture the standard deviation over the available history.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge', a staple item. Initial demand samples (Jan/Feb) averaged ~230 units/week. However, since the start of the game (Feb 11), observed demand has been 233, 271, 174, and 145, showing a downward trend as we move further from the peak winter season. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (303 units), Period 2 (302 units), Period 3 (301 units), and Period 4 (235 units). As of the Period 4 conclude message (read at the start of Period 5), none of these have arrived. This is consistent with a lead time of 4: the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales. For the OR backend: L is kept at 'default' (4). mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent softening in demand (averaging ~205) compared to earlier higher samples. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 141 units, with 838 units in transit (ordered in Periods 2, 3, and 4). Historical demand across the 10 available data points (seeded + observed) ranges from 145 to 294. The recent 5 periods show a mean demand of 197, lower than the seed data average of 229, suggesting a slight cooling in demand for these scalloped-edge socks as we move further into spring. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand forecasting to reflect this lower trend. Since L=4 is confirmed, the base stock logic needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With 141 on hand and 838 in the pipeline, total inventory position is 979, which is approximately enough for 5 periods at an average demand of 196. This suggests the OR backend will place minimal or capped orders to maintain the target service level against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand regime stable but lower than seed data, averaging 197 units over last 5 periods (P1-P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-157.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 25th. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Demand has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the initial seed data. The seed data mean was ~229, but the realized demand in the game (P1-P6) averages 188 units. Over the last 4 periods (P3-P6), the average is even lower at 156 units. The product is 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge', which may see slightly softening demand as spring progresses, though it remains a year-round staple. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the in-game demand regime (averaging 188) while moving away from the higher seed data. On-hand + In-transit (300 + 542 = 842) is significantly higher than the expected demand for (L+1)=5 periods (~940 based on mean), but the OR backend's cap and base stock logic will prevent over-ordering as long as parameters reflect the current stable demand. I will maintain L=4.

Carry-over insight: In-game demand regime (P1-P6) is significantly lower than seed data, averaging 188 units vs seed 229 (-18%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-331.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (matches promised). The 'in-game' demand regime for this SKU (Scallop 5p Socks) is consistently lower than the pre-game seed data. For the first 7 periods, the average demand is 180.4 units, while more recent demand (last 4 periods) is even lower at 146.25 units. The date 2019/4/1 marks the start of Spring/post-Mother's Day in some regions, which might see a shift in sock demand, but currently, the downward trend is clear. I will use recent_N (N=7) for \u03bc\u0302 to capture this lower volume and prevent excessive holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0 implies a target service level of 50%, so overstocking is as costly as stockouts). Pipeline inventory is healthy with orders from P4 (235 units), P6 (6 units), and P7 (98 units) scheduled for arrival in Periods 8, 10, and 11 respectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains significantly lower than seed data; recent 4-period mean (P4-P7) is ~146 units, compared to full in-game avg of 180 units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), the product (Scallop 5p Socks) shows a clear and sustained demand decrease compared to the pre-game seed data. The in-game history (P1-P8) demand sequence is: 233, 271, 174, 145, 162, 143, 135, 182. The average for the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is 153.4 units, which is significantly lower than the seed average of ~229. The actual lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (P1 at P5, P2 at P6, P3 at P7, P4 at P8). On-hand inventory is currently high (519 units) with 202 units in transit. Given the high holding cost (equal to profit), it is critical to avoid overstocking by adjusting the demand forecast down. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at default since the promised lead time of 4 is being met precisely.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed lower than seed: P4-P8 average demand is 153.4 units vs seed 229 (-33%). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The product is Scallop 5p Socks, a female fashion staple. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in Period 8 conclude message). On-hand inventory is 454 and in-transit is 248. The demand regime has shifted significantly lower since the seed data (avg ~229) and even since the start of the game (avg P1-P5 ~197). The last 6 periods (P4-P9) show an average demand of 122.5 (145, 162, 143, 135, 182, 65). Period 9 demand was particularly low (65 units), which could be post-Easter cooling or a random fluctuation. To be responsive but stable, I will use a recent window of N=6 to capture this lower demand regime. Given L=4, mu_hat should target 5 periods of demand (L+1). With demand around 125/week, mu_hat target is 625. sigma_hat will also use the last 6 periods to reflect the recent volatility. We have significant on-hand and pipeline inventory relative to this lower demand, so the OR backend should scale back ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at lower levels: P4-P9 average demand is ~123 units, significantly lower than seed and early game levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

The current date is April 22nd. Demand for 'Scallop 5p Socks' has shown a significant downward trend throughout the game periods, dropping from an average of ~200 in the first 5 periods to an average of ~117 in the last 5 periods (P6-P10). In the most recent two periods (P9 and P10), demand fell sharply to 65 and 59 respectively. This indicates a strong shift away from the higher seed data mean of 229. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods (P6 order arrived in P10). With On-hand inventory at 401 and In-transit at 242 (total pipeline of 643), we are significantly overstocked relative to the recent demand mean (~117) and lead time (4+1=5 periods). I will set L to calculate based on the stable lead time history. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the newest, lower demand regime (averaging 116.8 per period, so mu_hat should be ~584). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current reduced volatility in this lower demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline: P6-P10 average demand is 116.8 units, compared to P1-P5 avg of 197 units (-40% reduction).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product (Scallop 5p Socks) is experiencing a continued and significant demand decline. Recent demand for Periods 9, 10, and 11 was 65, 59, and 54 respectively, bringing the Period 7-11 average to 83 units. This is far below the initial seed data (avg 229) and even the early game average. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (P6 and P7 orders arrived exactly on schedule). We currently have 445 units on-hand and 144 in-transit (P8 order of 98 and P9 order of 46). Given that current on-hand inventory alone covers approximately 5 periods of demand at current rates (445 / 83 \u2248 5.3), and the pipeline adds another 1.7 periods of cover, the inventory level is very high relative to holding costs (both $1.0). To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the most recent local average (~83 units per period). L remains at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline deepened: P9-P11 average demand is 59.3 units, compared to P6-P8 average of 153.3 units (-61% drop). Cumulative on-hand inventory now significantly exceeds short-term requirements.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (women's fine-knit socks) is experiencing a significant and sustained demand decline. The initial seed demand (~229) and early game demand (P1-P8 avg ~165) have dropped sharply in the last four periods (P9-P12), averaging only 64 units. This decline is likely due to the product being a 'socks' item moving out of its peak winter/early spring season into the warmer May period (Period 13 date: 2019/5/6). Current on-hand inventory (465 units) is extremely high relative to this new demand regime, representing over 7 periods of supply at the recent average. Additionally, there are 46 units still in transit from Period 9. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to minimize further ordering by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower demand levels (using N=4 for the current regime). This will allow the OR backend to identify the massive inventory surplus and stop ordering until the current stock is depleted, thereby minimizing holding costs which equal profit for this SKU ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand has dropped by ~60% from earlier periods, averaging 64 units over P9-P12 compared to 165 units over P1-P8. This aligns with seasonal transit away from winter-weight socks in May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Demand for 'Scallop 5p Socks' has entered a significant low-demand regime, likely due to seasonality (warming weather reducing demand for fine-knit socks). Demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has averaged approximately 61.6 units (65, 59, 54, 78, 52), compared to the early game average of ~180. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 459 units, which is enough to cover approximately 7.5 periods of demand at the current average rate. With a lead time of 4 periods, total safety stock and pipeline coverage needed (L+1 = 5 periods) is roughly 308 units (5 * 61.6). Given that on-hand inventory (459) already exceeds this requirement and there are no units in transit, the goal is to avoid ordering while purging excess stock and minimizing holding costs. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to reflect this lower demand regime and use default L and sigma_hat settings.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime confirmed: P9-P13 average demand is 61.6 units, a ~65% decrease from early-game (P1-P5) levels.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Scallop 5p Socks' has entered a sustained low-demand regime, likely due to spring/summer seasonality. Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), demand has averaged 61.5 units, significantly lower than the early-game average of 170+. We currently have 398 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With a lead time of 4 periods and a service level (q) of 0.5 (as Profit = Holding Cost = $1.0), our target base stock should be approximately (L+1) * mean_demand = 5 * 61.5 = 307.5 units. Since our on-hand inventory (398) already exceeds this target, the OR backend will correctly place zero orders. I will use recent_N=6 to reflect this new demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product (fine-knit scallop socks) has entered a low-demand summer phase. Demand has stabilized at a much lower level compared to the start of the simulation; the average demand for the last 7 periods (P9-P15) is 59.7 units. On-hand inventory is currently 349 units with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time (L) of 4, the target total inventory (covering L+1=5 periods) at the current demand rate would be approximately 300 units (5 * 60). Since current on-hand inventory (349) already exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect this new low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend correctly identifies the surplus.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand summer regime fully established: P9-P15 average demand is 59.7 units, representing a ~74% reduction from the initial seed/P1-P2 levels (~230 units).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for 'Scallop 5p Socks' has significantly declined as part of a seasonal shift away from winter-wear, stabilizing at a much lower regime. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P9-P16) is approximately 57 units, compared to the early-game average of ~180-230 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 311 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 5 periods of demand. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), excess inventory is highly penalizing. No new orders are needed; however, the OR backend requires parameters that reflect this low-demand state to avoid triggering unnecessary orders as on-hand inventory gradually depletes. I am using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained low-demand summer regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. We are in the middle of the summer low-demand regime for this socks SKU. Demand has consistently declined over the last few months, with the most recent observed demand (Period 17) hitting a low of 29 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 45.8 units, which is significantly lower than the early-game average of ~230. Since June is typically a slow month for socks and the trend is still downward (evidenced by 38 followed by 29), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this most recent sustained low-volume state. On-hand inventory is 282 units, which covers over 6 weeks of current demand, so the OR backend will continue to suppress new orders. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline continued into June: P13-P17 average demand is 45.8 units, compared to P9-P13 average of 61.6 units (-25% further decline).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (women's fine-knit socks) is currently in a deep summer low-demand regime, which is consistent with seasonal trends for knitwear in June. Demand is extremely low, with only 14 units sold in the most recent period. On-hand inventory is 268 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the expected demand for the next several periods (at 14-30 units/week, this covers roughly 10-20 weeks). There is no pipeline inventory, and no new orders are necessary to meet service levels. The 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=10 (covering P9-P18) captures this sustained low-demand regime (average ~47 units/period) better than the cumulative average. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods per history.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new low in June (Period 18 demand of 14 units); the 5-period average (P14-P18) is 38.2 units, a 38% decrease from the P9-P13 average of 61.6 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for 'Scallop 5p Socks' has reached its lowest sustained level of the game, likely due to summer seasonality for this specific product description. The last 5 periods (P15-P19) show average demand of 31.0 units, a drastic reduction from the initial seed/period 1 levels (~230 units). On-hand inventory is 243 units, which at the current burn rate of ~31 units per period, covers approximately 7.8 periods of demand. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked (nearly double the required safety stock). The 'In-transit' quantity is zero, and we have ordered 0 units for the last 10 periods to burn off the excess. I will continue to use a recent_N approach (N=5) to reflect this low-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat accurately reflect current reality to prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary orders while our stock level is so high. Transitioning L to 'calculate' as it has been stable at 4 periods throughout the game.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand floor reached (Periods 17-19): demand average dropped further to ~22.7 units/period, suggesting a seasonal trough. Current on-hand inventory provides ~8 periods of cover against a 4-period lead time.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), the demand for women's socks continues to dwell at a seasonal trough. The last five periods (P16-P20) show demand values of 38, 29, 14, 25, and 14, averaging 24 units per week. This represents a significant decline from the early-game average (~230 units) and the spring-regime average (~60 units). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 229 units, which, at the current demand rate of ~24 units/period, provides approximately 9.5 periods of coverage. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods and the OR backend uses a base stock policy (L+1), we need approximately 120 units (5 * 24) to cover current needs. With 229 units on hand and 0 in transit, we are significantly overstocked. To prevent further accumulation of units and minimize holding costs which equal the profit margin ($1.00), I will continue to set the demand parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (recent_N=5) and lead time to the confirmed stable value. The inventory level is high enough that the OR backend will naturally skip ordering until on-hand levels drop closer to the base stock target.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (women's fine-knit socks) is currently in a deep seasonal trough during July. Historical demand has consistently declined: P1-P5 (late winter) averaged ~197 units, dropping to ~60 units in May (P13-P16), and further to ~13.3 units over the last 3 periods (P19-P21). Current on-hand inventory (217 units) is extremely high relative to current demand, providing over 16 periods of cover against a 4-period lead time. With a profit of $1 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims to maximize service level while minimizing waste. Given the substantial inventory surplus and sustained low demand, I will use a very small recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current seasonal floor and prevent further ordering while holding costs accumulate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed for July: Average demand for P19-P21 is 13.7 units, a further ~40% decrease from the June average of ~23 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The SKU (Fine-knit socks) is in the middle of a seasonal summer low-demand regime, which has stabilized at very low levels. Demand for the last three periods (P20-P22) has been 14, 12, and 17 units, averaging approximately 14.3 units per period. With an on-hand inventory of 200 units and an average demand of ~14 units, the current stock provides roughly 14 periods of cover, which significantly exceeds the promised lead time of 4 periods plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. The OR backend needs to be informed of this extremely low-demand regime to prevent it from placing unnecessary orders despite the high on-hand inventory. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) captures this trough. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Scallop 5p Socks) is in a deep seasonal trough during July. Demand for Period 23 was 14 units, and the average over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) is 16.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 186 units, which covers over 11 periods of current demand levels, far exceeding the 5-period (L+1) planning horizon. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the base stock level should be the median demand over the (1+L) period. With such high excess inventory, no new orders are desired. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (representing the current summer trough) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to minimize the target inventory level and confirm that no replenishment is needed. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for July confirmed: P19-P23 average demand is 16.4 units, maintaining the ~90% reduction from the early-game/seed average (~230 units).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product (fine-knit scallop socks) is currently in a deep summer demand trough. Analysis of recent demand (P20-P24: 14, 12, 17, 14, 28) confirms a stable but very low average of approximately 17 units per period. This represents a >90% reduction from the early-game/seed levels (~230 units). On-hand inventory is 158 units, which, at the current demand rate, provides over 9 periods of stock cover. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand and the holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0), making inventory efficiency crucial. I will use the most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the localized summer trough. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on history.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. We are in a deep summer demand trough for socks. Demand has stabilized at very low levels, with the last 5 periods (P21-P25) averaging approximately 20 units. On-hand inventory is 129 units, which covers over 6 periods of demand at current rates (20 units/period * 6 = 120), exceeding the 4-period lead time. As August progresses, we should anticipate a potential gradual return of demand for 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge' as the autumn season approaches. However, given the high holding cost (equal to profit) and significant current stock, the strategy remains to allow existing inventory to bleed down. I will continue using a recent_N (N=5) approach to capture the current trough while keeping the system reactive to any uptick in late August/September.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for 'Scallop 5p Socks' has shown a slight upward trend over the last three periods (28, 29, 43), rising from the summer trough of ~15 units observed in July. This aligns with the transition toward the back-to-school and autumn retail season. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 26.2 units. With 86 units currently on-hand and 0 in-transit, we have about 3.3 periods of cover against a 4-period lead time. Using an L+1 (5 period) demand window, we expect to need roughly 130-150 units to cover the lead time safely as demand begins to recover. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent uptick while discarding the extreme lows of the July trough, ensuring the OR backend triggers a replenishment order to meet the rising demand by the time it arrives in 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery signaled: P24-P26 average demand is 33.3 units, up from the P19-P23 trough average of 16.4 units (+100% increase), likely marking the start of the autumn/back-to-school transition.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge' (608776002) is currently transitioning from the summer demand trough (approx. 15-20 units/period in July) into the autumn recovery phase. Demand has increased over the last three periods: 29 (P25), 43 (P26), and 58 (P27). The average demand over the last four periods (P24-P27) is 39.5 units. Given the transition into mid-August (school/work prep season), I expect demand to continue climbing toward the early-year levels (approx. 140-160 units). Current on-hand inventory is 28 units, with 45 units in-transit (ordered P27). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since on-hand inventory is now very low relative to the upward demand trend, I will set mu_hat to capture the recent recovery (recent_N=4) to ensure the OR backend triggers replenishment. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility during this regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P24-P27 demand (28, 29, 43, 58) shows a clear upward trend from the July trough of ~16 units, averaging 39.5 units (+140% vs July). This marks the autumn seasonal transition for socks.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608776002 (socks) has transitioned from a summer trough (~16 units/period in July) into an autumn recovery phase. Demand over the last four periods has increased steadily (28, 29, 43, 58, and 63 most recently). The current date is August 26, aligning with 'Back to School' and autumn preparation, which historically drives sock sales. Demand in Period 28 reached 63, and the average for the last four concluded periods (P25-P28) is 48.25 units. I expect this upward trend to continue as we enter September. On-hand inventory is now 0, with a stockout occurring in Period 28 (sold 28 vs demand 63). Pipeline inventory is 108 units (ordered P27-P28), with the first arrival expected in Period 31. To account for the sharp upward trend and prevent further stockouts during the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 275 (representing an average demand of 55 units over the 5-period risk window of L+1), and use an explicit sigma_hat of 45 to handle the increasing volatility during this regime shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Demand increased for 5 consecutive periods (28 to 63), averaging 53 units over the last 3 periods, marking the end of the summer trough.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (2019/9/2). Demand has transitioned from a summer low (~16 units in July) to an autumn recovery phase. The last four periods of demand (P26-P29) were 43, 58, 63, and 40 units respectively (averaging 51 units/period). This confirms the seasonal uptick for 'Fine-knit socks' as we move toward cooler weather. We are currently stocked out (on-hand = 0), so we are relying entirely on the in-transit pipeline (197 units) to satisfy coming demand. The order placed in P27 (45 units) is expected to arrive in P31 (following the stable lead time of 4 periods). Since the demand regime has shifted upwards significantly from the summer trough, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current autumn recovery levels (average ~51 units/period) while maintaining the promised lead time of 4 periods. This should help the system maintain higher base stock levels to keep up with the seasonal climb.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery regime confirmed (P26-P29): Demand has increased to an average of 51 units/period, up from the summer trough of ~16 units (+218% increase).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the autumn seasonal recovery. Demand has shown a clear upward trend from the July trough (~16 units), with the last period reaching 92 units. The 5-period average (P26-P30) is approximately 59 units, and the 3-period average (P28-P30) is 65 units. However, current on-hand inventory is 0, and shipments from P27 (45 units) are expected to arrive in Period 31 (current period, visible next period). Pipeline inventory is 255 units. Given the transition into a higher-demand season for socks (September), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent recovery trend (average ~59.2), projecting a demand of ~296 over the 5-period lead-plus-review cycle. This should trigger an appropriate order size to replenish the depleted on-hand stock and meet the rising demand while accounting for the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery trajectory confirmed: Demand surged to 92 units in P30, with a 5-period average (P26-P30) of 59.2 units, representing a 260% increase from the summer trough.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks is in a clear autumn recovery phase (Period 30: 92 units, Period 31: 116 units). The 5-period average (P27-P31) has risen to 73.8 units, while the very recent 3-period average is 82.6 units. Given the transition into late September, I expect demand to continue increasing toward the levels seen in February (~230 units). Current on-hand is 0, and we have a pipeline of 251 units (P28 order of 63 arriving P32, P29 order of 89 arriving P33, P30 order of 58 arriving P34, P31 order of 41 arriving P35). To prevent ongoing stockouts during this surge, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the latest momentum, while lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: P29-P31 average demand is 82.7 units, a 400% increase from the summer trough (16 units), with the most recent period (P31) hitting 116 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608776002 is experiencing a significant autumn/winter seasonal surge. Period 32 demand remained high at 116 units, matching Period 31. The 3-period average (P30-P32) is 108 units, compared to the summer trough of ~16 units. However, current on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in P28-P32 (except for partial arrivals). The pipeline inventory is 335 units (comprising orders from P29: 89, P30: 58, P31: 41, P32: 147). The order from P29 (89 units) is expected to arrive in Period 33, followed by P30 (58 units) in Period 34. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a 3-period window (N=3) for mu_hat correctly captures the recent trend of ~108 units/period better than longer averages, balancing the need to replenish stock for the winter peak while accounting for the significant volume already in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a high level, averaging 108 units over P30-P32, a nearly 7x increase from the summer trough. Stockout conditions persisted from P28-P32 due to this rapid surge catching up with the 4-period lead time.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit scallop socks has entered a sharp seasonal winter-peak surge as we transition into October. Period 33 observed a massive demand spike of 319 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 'autumn recovery' average of ~110 units. While some of this may be idiosyncratic or due to backlogged demand from previous stockouts, the trend clearly aligns with the initial seed data (P1-P3) which averaged ~230 units. We are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Pipeline inventory is 377 units (consisting of orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33). An arrival from P30 (ordered 58) is expected this period, followed by P31 (ordered 41) next period. Given the recent spike to 319 units, the moving averages (recent_N) will likely underestimate the immediate requirement. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to project demand around 200 units per period (matching the late-winter seed data) to capture the (L+1)=5 period horizon requirement. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for the high volatility observed during these seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Demand surged to 319 units in P33. New demand regime established for Autumn/Winter transition, significantly exceeding the previous recovery average of 108 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit scallop socks has entered a high-level Autumn/Winter peak. Demand in Period 33 was 319 units and Period 34 was 272 units, confirming a massive surge compared to the summer trough (~16 units) and even the early-game average (~230 units). The product is currently out of stock (0 on-hand) due to this surge outstripping previous pipeline orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the stockout state, the focus is on maintaining a high base stock to capture this peak while the OR engine caps orders based on the 4-period pipeline. I am using recent_N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific peak regime (P33-P34 average ~295 units) without dilution from the recovery phase (P28-P32).

Carry-over insight: High-demand Autumn/Winter regime peak confirmed: P33-P34 demand averaged 295.5 units, a 1800% increase from the summer trough and significantly higher than the initial seed data. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand Autumn/Winter regime, with demand surging to ~300 units per period (P33-P35 avg = 302). Previous orders were insufficient due to a rapid seasonal transition from the summer trough (16 units) to winter peak, resulting in stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (896 units) consists of orders from P32 (147), P33 (131), P34 (267), and P35 (351). I expect the P32 arrival (147 units) next period, which will likely be fully consumed. To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P33-P35) to capture the ~300 unit/period demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting parameters to ensure base stock covers (L+1) periods of this high demand.

Carry-over insight: High-demand winter regime sustained: P33-P35 average demand is 302 units, requiring significantly higher base stock levels than early-game or seed data.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge' (608776002) is currently in its peak winter demand regime. Starting from late September (Period 33), demand surged significantly, averaging 295.3 units over the last four periods (P33-P36: 319, 272, 315, 275). This is a massive increase over the summer trough (~16 units) and even significantly higher than the initial seed data (~230 units). The product has faced stockouts since Period 31 because the rapid surge exceeded the inflow allowed by the 4-period lead time. Arrival resolution data (from P31 to P36) confirms the lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory currently at 0 and a high-demand regime established, the priority is to maintain a high base stock that covers the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1 total). I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific peak winter regime. This will calculated a base stock based on the ~295 average, allowing the OR backend to place orders that bridge the gap between 1094 units in-transit and the target inventory level needed to satisfy this sustained peak.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand regime sustained: P33-P36 average demand is 295.3 units/period, representing the highest demand level observed in the game cycle.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Scallop 5p Socks has entered a high-intensity winter peak regime, with demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) averaging 305.2 units. This is a massive surge from the summer trough (~16 units) and significantly higher than the initial seed data. We are currently facing stockouts due to the steep ramp-up, with on-hand inventory sitting at 0. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To stabilize service levels and capture the peak demand, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the stable high-demand window P33-P37). Sigma_hat also uses N=5 to reflect recent volatility. A total of 1300 units are in-transit, which covers approximately 4.2 periods of current demand, meaning we need to maintain aggressive ordering to avoid further stockouts during this winter peak.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand regime sustained: P33-P37 demand average is 305.2 units/period, requiring maximum order support to recover from stockouts.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks has entered its peak winter regime, with Period 38 hitting a new high of 410 units. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P33-P38) is approximately 326 units. Stockouts have persisted because the rapid seasonal surge (from ~20 units in summer to 300+ units now) has consistently outpaced arrivals due to the 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 1259 units. Although 351 units (from P35) are expected to arrive in Period 39, the current base stock must be high enough to satisfy this peak demand. I will use a 6-period recent average (N=6, covering the winter peak regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock target reflects the current ~325 units/period demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand regime confirmed (P33-P38): Average demand has reached ~326 units/period, with a peak of 410 units in P38, significantly exceeding the initial seed data of 229.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak winter demand regime for socks (Period 40: Nov 11th). Demand has surged dramatically compared to mid-year, with the last 5 periods (P35-P39) averaging 342 units/period, and a peak of 410 units. We experienced significant stockouts between P28 and P39 due to this surge exceeding initial supply projections and the 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is substantial pipeline inventory (1263 units) coming from orders placed in P36-P39. Specifically, 345 units ordered in P36 are expected to arrive during P40. The goal is to maintain high availability during this peak season while managing the $1/unit holding cost. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand winter regime (~342 mean), which is significantly higher than the training seed data (229) or early-game levels.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand regime confirmed (P35-P39): Average demand has stabilized at ~342 units/period, roughly 50% higher than seed data (229) and nearly 20x higher than the summer trough (~16 units). Lead time remains stable exactly at 4 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand winter peak regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) has averaged 357.4 units, with the most recent demand being 392 units. There is zero on-hand inventory due to persistent stockouts as demand significantly exceeds earlier seasonal expectations (seed data was 229). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 7 periods remaining in the game (P41-P47), and a 4-period lead time, orders placed now will arrive in P45, leaving only 3 periods of sales (P45, P46, P47) for those units. Therefore, it is critical to maintain a high base stock to capture these remaining sales while being mindful of the game end. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the stabilized high-demand peak (averaging ~357 units/period) and L=4. This ensures the OR engine targets a base stock reflecting current peak levels (~1787 units) minus the 1344 units already in transit, helping to reconcile the inventory deficit during these final periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand stabilized (P36-P40): Average demand is 357.4 units, representing a 56% increase over the initial seed data (229) and a 115% increase over the early Autumn recovery level (166).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks continues to follow a strong seasonal upward trend as we move into late November (Period 42). The recent 5-period average demand (P37-P41) is approximately 390 units, significantly exceeding the seed data and previous winter peak averages. In Period 41, demand hit a new high of 438 units. Despite a lead time of 4 periods and consistent ordering, we are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) because the rapid demand surge outpaced the pipeline arrivals. The pipeline (1450 units) is robust, with 226 units (from P38) expected to arrive during this period (visible next period). To ensure we capture this peak demand and rebuild a buffer to avoid further stockouts, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime of ~390 units/period, and applying this across the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same period to account for the increased volatility during this peak season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand reached new heights: P37-P41 average demand is ~390 units, a 10% increase over the P35-P39 average (~357 units) and 70% higher than seed data.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), entering the peak winter demand phase for socks. Demand surged significantly to 682 units in Period 42, likely due to pre-Christmas shopping or a weather-driven spike. The 5-period average (P38-P42) is 457.4 units. On-hand inventory is 0, while pipeline inventory is high (1,675 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the product being socks in early December, I expect demand to remain very high or increase further before the Christmas peak. To capture this surge and prevent stockouts, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) which captures the 682 spike, and sigma_hat using the same period to account for the high volatility (682 vs 365-438 in previous weeks). Setting L=4 (default) as lead time is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand intensified: demand hit 682 units in Period 42 (Dec 2), significantly exceeding the previous winter plateau of ~390 units. The 5-period average (P38-P42) is now 457 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak gift-giving and winter season (Period 44, Dec 9). Demand has shown extreme volatility in the last two periods, hitting a massive peak of 682 in P42 (Cyber Monday week) and then retracting to 280 in P43. Despite the drop in P43, the seasonal context and the preceding upward trend suggest demand will remain high through December. On-hand inventory is very low (75 units) compared to the scale of recent demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and recent peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P39-P43) which averages 429.4 units, and applying a slight upward adjustment for the 'explicit' method to 450 units to ensure we are covering the potential for another pre-holiday spike. This results in a mu_hat of 2250 (5 * 450). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high standard deviation observed during the P42 peak, which will correctly increase the safety stock (base stock) in the OR backend to prevent further stockouts during this critical window.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak observed: Period 42 demand hit 682 units. Current regime (P39-P43) averages 429.4 units, representing the highest sustained demand level in the game cycle.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the holiday season (mid-December), and while demand has softened from the Dec 2 spike of 682, it remains elevated (average of ~391 units over P39-P43). Current on-hand is 202 with 1749 in-transit. An order of 443 (placed P41) is expected to arrive during the current period (P45), visible next period. Considering the 4-period lead time, we need to maintain a base stock that covers demand until P49. The recent 5-period average (P40-P44) is 418 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this high-demand winter regime while allowing for the slight post-spike stabilization. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility seen during the early-December peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $195.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), which is the final week before and during the Christmas holiday. In-game demand history shows a massive peak in Period 42 (682 units), followed by a stabilization at a lower but still high level (280-420 units) as we move deeper into December. The most recent demand (P45) was 420 units. Given the date, demand is likely to remain high this week but will significantly drop after Christmas (next 1-2 periods). On-hand inventory is 225, with 1,306 units in transit. Specifically, the order from P42 (451 units) is due this period (P46), and the order from P43 (612 units) is due in P47. These arrivals will provide substantial cover. To avoid excessive holding costs as the winter peak subsides, I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the recent 5-period average (P41-P45), which is 423.8 units. Since the lead time is fixed at 4 periods, I set mu_hat to (1+4) * 423.8 = 2119. Let L=4.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration expected after Period 46. Recent 5-period demand average (P41-P45) is 423.8 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 47 (Dec 30), marking the transition from the peak holiday season into the post-holiday winter period. Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of ~345 units per period after the Dec 2 spike of 682. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am setting L=4 and using a recent_N window for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I've selected N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent post-peak demand level (averaging 343.8 units). Despite the high in-transit volume (1443 units), maintaining a current base stock level is necessary to ensure the system reacts appropriately to the post-holiday deceleration trend that usually follows early January. The pipeline inventory (1443) + current on-hand (296) covers approximately 5 periods of forecasted demand, aligning with the (L+1) goal.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand P43-P46 is 344.8 units, down 25% from the P39-P43 average of 429.4 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
