  "rationale": "For Period 1 (2019-02-11), we are managing a 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse. Historical demand shows a declining trend from Jan (186 units) to early Feb (89 units), which likely reflects a post-holiday/early winter clearance or transition phase. World knowledge suggests that early-to-mid February corresponds with the pre-Spring transition in fashion. Demand has stabilized around ~90 units/week recently. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since my pipeline covers L+1 periods (5 periods: Period 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), I need to forecast total demand for those 5 periods. Using a conservative estimate of 90 units per week, total expected demand is 450 units. Starting inventory and in-transit units are both 0. Given the lead time delay and the risk of lost orders, I will order enough to cover the lead time pipeline plus a small safety stock to handle potential fluctuations as we move closer to the Spring season. I will order 500 units to ensure I am not stock-out when the shipment arrives in Period 5.",

  "rationale": "The product is a women's blouse, which has shown clear seasonal shifts. Demand peaked in September (~130 units) and has since entered a winter decline. Current demand averages roughly 30-40 units per period, excluding the Period 42 spike (137 units) which was attributed to a Black Friday promotional period (matching the 2019/11/25 date). Period 43 demand (74) likely represents residual holiday activity or post-promotion volume. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and the game ending at Period 47, any order placed now (Period 44) would arrive at the start of Period 48, which is beyond the tournament horizon. Therefore, the goal is to manage the existing on-hand inventory (175 units) to cover the remaining periods (44, 45, 46, 47). Given the recent non-spike average of ~35 units, total expected demand for the remaining 4 periods is approximately 140-160 units. The current on-hand inventory of 175 is sufficient to cover this demand while avoiding excessive holding costs. No further orders are needed as the horizon is closing.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a long-sleeved woven blouse (697054003). We are currently in Period 45 (Dec 16). Historical data from Jan 2019 (186, 132, 98, 86) and Feb 2019 (89, 79 on P1) shows that the highest demand occurs in early-to-mid January, presumably due to post-holiday wardrobe refreshing or the start of the new year. Recent demand has been low (26 units in P44), with a singular spike in P42 (137) due to Black Friday. However, looking at the historical start of the year (Jan 7: 186 units), we expect a significant surge in demand starting in 2-3 periods. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. An order placed now (P45) will arrive in P49. With the game ending in P47, any order placed now will arrive AFTER the game has concluded and will not contribute to revenue or profit, but will only incur holding costs if the simulation were to continue. Even if the game extended, current on-hand inventory (149) is sufficient to cover the low winter demand for the remaining 3 periods (P45, P46, P47) based on the recent trend (avg ~30-50 outside of events). Therefore, the optimal strategy to maximize profit and avoid unnecessary holding costs at the end of the simulation is to order nothing.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a long-sleeved woven blouse, which typically faces lower demand during mid-winter. The current date is Dec 23, 2019 (Period 46). Demand in the last period (P45) was 75 units, potentially reflecting a late-holiday shopping bump. However, historical data from Jan 2019 (186, 132, 98, 86) indicates higher demand in early Q1. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 74 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, there is a risk of stockout by the arrival of the next order (around P50/P51). Given that the current decision (P46) arrives in P50, and we have zero units in the pipeline for P47, P48, and P49, the on-hand inventory of 74 is extremely likely to be depleted before the next shipment arrives, considering the historical Jan 1st move towards ~180 units. I will place a conservative order to rebuild inventory for the early January demand spike, while acknowledging the game's termination is near (likely P50 or shortly after). Considering the high holding cost ($1) and 4-period lead time, I will order 150 units to cover the expected January recovery without over-stocking.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a long-sleeved woven blouse (everyday collection). Current date is Dec 30, transitioning from the Christmas/New Year peak into the Jan/Feb period. Historical data (Jan 2019) shows demand ranging from 186 down to 86, and Feb/March data shows demand around 80-130. Recent demand has been volatile due to holidays (P45: 75, P46: 53), but is expected to stabilize or slightly increase as a basic 'everyday' item in Q1. The 4-period lead time remains consistent. Current on-hand is low (21). An order of 150 was placed in P46 (expected arrival P50). To cover the remaining pipeline (P47-P51) and ensure stock for the anticipated early-year demand (estimated mean ~95-100), the current pipeline (21 on hand + 150 in transit = 171) is insufficient for 5 periods of demand (~475-500 units). I will place an order to bring total pipeline up to cover the lead time + 1 period risk window.",
