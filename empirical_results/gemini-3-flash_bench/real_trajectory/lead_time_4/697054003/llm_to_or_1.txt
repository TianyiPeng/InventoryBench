Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Despacito' Blouse. Since it is the start of the game, there is no history of arrivals or on-hand inventory. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a downward trend (186, 132, 98, 86, 89), but we are entering mid-February, which may see a shift in demand for 'Everyday Collection' items. Given the 1-period delay in observing arrivals and the 4-period stated lead time, we need to cover demand for at least (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the mean of the provided 5 historical samples (avg = 118.2) as my base forecast. For L, I will use the promised 'default' lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (118.2 * 5 = 591) to capture the most recent context. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to represent volatility across this regime.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The product is a Women's Everyday Blouse. Looking at historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 11), the demand sequence is: 186, 132, 98, 86, 89, 79. This shows a clear downward trend following the post-holiday/New Year period, settling into a lower baseline around 80-90 units per week. The promised lead time is 4. In Period 1, we ordered 188 units; this order is correctly 'In-transit' and not expected to arrive until Period 5 (L=4). However, current on-hand inventory is 0 because we started with 0 and the P1 order is still in transit, resulting in lost sales for Period 1 (demand 79, sold 0). To minimize further lost sales and account for the 4-period lead time, I need to set parameters that assume a demand baseline around the recent average (~85 units). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current stable regime (89, 86, 79, and the Feb 4 value 89) to avoid over-ordering based on the high January peaks.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 289 units in-transit (188 ordered in P1, 101 ordered in P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. The product is a women's blouse belonging to the 'Everyday Collection'. Demand over the last 7 weeks (including pre-game history) has been: 186, 132, 98, 86, 89 (pre-game) and 79, 130 (game history). There's no clear seasonal spike yet for early spring, but demand is fluctuating between 80-130. Since promised L=4, my parameters need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the last 5 samples (N=5) for the mean calculation provides a more recent demand estimate (avg ~96.8) than the full history. Sigma remains at default to capture historical volatility. Note: Arrivals from P1 are expected at the start of Period 6 (visible at start of P7).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is a women's blouse from the 'Everyday Collection'. Historical demand samples from January were 186, 132, 98, 86, and 89. Since the game started (February), observed demand has been 79, 130, and 150, showing an upward trend as we move into March (likely early spring seasonality for blouses). We have on-hand inventory of 0 and a total in-transit of 448 units (orders from P1: 188, P2: 101, P3: 159). Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in P6. Consequently, we expect 0 arrivals for P4. For OR parameters, I am setting L to 4 (default). For mu_hat, the mean of the 5 pre-game samples plus 3 game samples (mean ~115) and recent growth suggests a forward-looking weekly demand around 140-150. Based on (1+L) = 5, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 700. For sigma_hat, I will use the default calculation based on all available samples to capture the historical volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697054003' is a women's blouse. Current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand data from early January to early February shows a declining trend (186 to 89), but real-time demand since Period 1 has stabilized between 79 and 150 (mean \u2248 118). Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, it is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase. Therefore, we have seen no arrivals yet ('arrived=0' in all history), which is expected. Total in-transit is 650 units, which covers nearly 5.5 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit, the target service level is 80%. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent stabilization around 118 units/period, and 'default' for lead time and sigma until we observe actual arrivals.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's blouse. The historical demand samples (Jan-Feb: 186, 132, 98, 86, 89) and game history (Feb-Mar: 79, 130, 150, 116, 98) show a mean demand of approximately 116.5 units per period. The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Using L=4, the pipeline should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~583 units). Currently, on-hand (90) + in-transit (462) = 552 units, which is slightly below the target. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most recent 10 data points (5 historical + 5 game), and a 'default' approach for sigma_hat as volatility remains moderate. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has stabilized. Recent demand over the last 6 periods is: 79, 130, 150, 116, 98, 109 (mean ~114). The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals from P1 and P2 in P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand is 82, and we have a pipeline of 455 units (orders from P3, P4, and P6). At a lead time of 4, the OR engine needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the last 6 samples (recent_N=6) provides a stable estimate of current demand without the noise of the earliest January samples. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it aligns with the observations of 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (April 1, 2019). The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand (post-initial seed data) for the last 7 periods is: 79, 130, 150, 116, 98, 109, 91. The mean of these 7 samples is 110.4. Looking at the seed data (186, 132, 98, 86, 89), there was a high peak in early January, followed by a decline and stabilization. The recent average (last 3 periods: 98, 109, 91) is 99.3, suggesting a slight stabilization at a lower level than the broad average. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3). On-hand is 150, and 374 units are in transit (orders from P4, P6, P7). A lead time of 4 means we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 3 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture the current stable demand level (approx 100/week) while ignoring the early-year spikes.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand since the start of the simulation (Periods 1-8) has a mean of approximately 109 units per period (79, 130, 150, 116, 98, 109, 91, 100). The most recent 5 periods (Periods 4-8) show a slightly lower and more stable mean of 102.8 units (116, 98, 109, 91, 100). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. Currently, we have 252 units on hand and 172 units in-transit (orders from Period 6 and 7). Calculations for mu_hat will use the recent demand trend (N=5) to avoid over-ordering as demand appears to be stabilizing or slightly dipping post-February. With L=4, the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 424 units. A mu_hat based on N=5 demand (mean ~103) for (L+1)=5 periods is approximately 515 units. Given the service level balance (Profit $4, Holding $1), we aim for a high service level, and setting parameters to recent levels ensures we don't carry excessive stock if the minor downward trend continues.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The item is a 'Womens Everyday Blouse'. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 98.2 units per week, which is lower than the initial startup volatility. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8) consistently show an actual lead time of 4 periods. The arrival for the order placed in P5 was zero in the P9 conclude message, which is expected because 5+4=9, so the P5 order arrives DURING Period 9 and will be visible in the P10 conclude message (which I will see at the start of P11). Currently, on-hand (171) plus in-transit (281) equals 452. With L=4, the pipeline should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 98.2 = 491 units. My L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat parameters will use the recent demand regime (approx. last 5-9 samples) to stabilize orders as we move past the initial inventory stock-up phase. I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover 5 periods of demand at the current average rate to ensure the OR backend targets approximately 500 units in total position.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 (2019/04/22). The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 conclude messages). No orders were lost; however, the order from Period 5 was 0 units, which explains why Period 9 showed 0 units arrived. The item 'Despacito Blouse' (Women's Everyday Collection) is moving into late spring. Demand shows a gradual decline from its peak in late February/early March (avg ~130-150) to the last few periods (avg ~75 over periods 9-10). Currently, we have 198 units on-hand and 309 in-transit. The in-transit inventory covers the orders from Period 7 (78), Period 9 (109), and Period 10 (122). With L=4, the pipeline inventory must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the last 5 demand samples (avg ~87 units/period) captures the recent cooling trend. I will set L to 4 explicitly and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the more recent lower demand levels and reduced volatility, balancing the $4/unit profit against the $1/unit holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 (orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 respectively). Note that the Period 5 order is missing from the arrival sequence, which is why L remains at 4. Demand history since P1 (excluding initial zeros) shows a mean of approximately 101.5. Looking at recent trends (P7-P11), demand has softened slightly (91, 100, 81, 67, 85), averaging 84.8. As we move further into spring/summer, demand for blouses typically stabilizes or slightly dips before a potential summer clearance or fall transition. Pipeline inventory (231) + on-hand (191) = 422 units. With L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N=5 for demand better reflects the current softening trend (~85/period) compared to the all-time mean (~101).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/5/6 (Period 13). The SKU (Women's Everyday Blouse) has a promised lead time of 4 periods, which is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 all showed lead_time=4). There are no missing shipments currently; arrivals for orders from Period 9, 10, and 12 are expected in Periods 13, 14, and 16 respectively. Analysis of the demand history (samples from 2019-01-07 to 2019-04-29) shows a stable regime. The mean demand across all 17 samples is 104 units, but more importantly, the demand in the most recent 5 periods (Periods 8-12: 100, 81, 67, 85, 101) averages 86.8 units. Given the transition from spring into early summer, there is no strong evidence of a seasonal spike for 'Everyday' blouses yet. Therefore, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the slightly lower recent demand stabilization. L will be set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is robustly observed. Sigma_hat remains 'default' to account for overall historical volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand since February has been relatively stable, with some minor fluctuations, but generally staying between 80 and 110 units per week. The last 5 periods (P9-P13) show demand of 81, 67, 85, 101, and 82, averaging 83.2. There is no strong evidence of a seasonal trend shift yet for May. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods as promised (confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, and P9). On-hand inventory is 117 units, and in-transit is 284 units (from orders in P10, P12, P13). Using recent demand (last 5 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat will better reflect the current regime compared to the early (higher) samples. L is set to calculated as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Examining the demand history from Period 1 through Period 14, demand has been relatively stable, fluctuating between 67 and 150 units per week. The mean demand over the last 14 periods is approximately 99.4 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P9, and P10). We are currently in Period 15, and the order placed in Period 11 (0 units) would have arrived 'during' Period 15. The in-transit inventory of 200 units corresponds to orders from P12 (26), P13 (136), and P14 (38). Since the demand regime appears stable without strong seasonal shifts in this spring window (late Feb to mid-May), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the most recent stability, and 'default' for lead time and sigma_hat as the promised lead time of 4 holds true.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Lead time is consistently behaving as 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from periods 1-4, 6-7, and 9-10. Demand has remained relatively stable since simulation start, typically fluctuating between 65 and 150 units per week. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (since Period 6) is approximately 89.4 units per week. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and 1 period for the current decision, we need to cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand. Current on-hand is 71 units and in-transit is 339 units, totaling 410 units. This pipeline covers 4.58 weeks of demand at the recent average. Orders from Period 12 (due next period), 13, 14, and 15 are in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 89 units/week) and 'default' for sigma_hat. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

The demand from Period 1 to Period 16 has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 94 units per week, showing no clear seasonal trend or regime shift yet. For Period 17, I will set L to 4. I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the most representative recent demand (approx. Avg=85 from P7-P16) while smoothing out minor fluctuations. This N accounts for the stable demand since the initial game startup volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 18 (June 10). The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a stable but slightly declining trend since the provided samples (early Feb around 180s down to recent May/June around 60-90s). The most recent demand was quite low (44), but demand for this type of garment typically stabilizes in early summer. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (arrived: P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P13, P14, P16, P17 all showed 4 periods). No orders seem lost. On-hand inventory is 94, with 323 in-transit (orders from P14, P15, P16, P17). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the history is consistently 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use a recent window (N=13) to capture the demand regime since March (Period 5 onwards), excluding the very high initial samples which seem part of a launch/prior season spike. This balances recent lower demand (mean approx 86) against earlier spring levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Historically, demand for this item has shown a slight downward trend as we move into the summer months (June), with recent weekly demand averaging approximately 67 units over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), compared to earlier averages. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 83 units, and there are 334 units in-transit. Shipments from P15 (139 units), P16 (61 units), P17 (85 units), and P18 (49 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 19, 20, 21, and 22 respectively. Given the observed demand slowdown, I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower mean and variance observed in the most recent 5 weeks (approx 67 units/week compared to the long-term average). This will help the OR backend avoid over-ordering during a seasonal dip while maintaining the target service level dictated by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P14: Average weekly demand decreased from ~90 to ~67 (-25%) as season transitions into mid-summer.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we are managing a women's long-sleeve blouse. Demand has stabilized into a lower summer regime which began around Period 14 (May 13). The average weekly demand for the last 6 periods (P14-P19) is 71 units, compared to the earlier average of ~100 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory status is relatively healthy: 152 on-hand plus 195 in-transit (orders from P16, P17, P18). The P16 order (61 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 20, bringing available stock to 213 before demand. To manage the lower summer demand and avoid excessive holding costs (holding cost is 25% of profit), mu_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the current 71 units/week trend multiplied by (1+L)=5 periods. sigma_hat is also updated using the recent regime to reflect current volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 21 (July 1st). The product is a women's blouse with long sleeves, which typically faces lower demand during peak summer months. We previously identified a demand regime shift starting in Period 14 (May 13), where the average weekly demand dropped from ~90 to ~67. Looking at the last 7 periods (P14-P20), the mean demand is 61.8, showing a sustained cooling trend. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods since tracking began. Current on-hand inventory is 156, and in-transit units (ordered P17, P18, P20) total 187. For Period 21, I will use a 7-period window (N=7) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current summer low-demand regime. This keeps the base stock target aligned with the lower seasonal demand to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a 4-period lead time buffer.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is a women's blouse with long sleeves, which is experiencing a seasonal decline as summer progresses. A demand regime shift was previously identified at Period 14, where average weekly demand dropped from ~90 to ~67. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 44, 49, 70, 57, 36) confirms a further softening, averaging 51.2 units per week. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 205, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 147, providing a total coverage of 352 units. Given the declining seasonal interest for long-sleeved blouses in July and high current inventory levels, I will adjust mu_hat using the most recent 8 periods of demand (averaging ~58 units/week) to capture the lower regime while maintaining a buffer. The OR backend will likely minimize ordering to reduce holding costs ($1.0/unit) relative to the $4.5/unit profit margin, given the sufficient stock currently available.

Carry-over insight: Further demand softening observed: Demand in Periods 17-21 averaged 51.2 units, a decrease from the previous regime of ~67.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a women's blouse, which is currently experiencing a seasonal demand decline as mid-summer progresses. I observed a secondary demand regime shift starting around Period 17, where demand has averaged 47.8 units per week (Periods 17-22: 44, 49, 70, 57, 36, 33), significantly lower than the previous average of ~67. The most recent three periods (P20-P22) have averaged 42 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P18 arriving in P22). On-hand inventory is high (221 units) and pipeline inventory is 116 units, totaling 337 units. Given the low current demand and high inventory, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low-demand regime, and increase sigma_hat slightly to reflect the volatility during this transition. This will likely result in minimal or zero ordering this period to drain the excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: Average demand has fallen to ~48 units per week (-28% vs previous regime) as of Period 22.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a women's blouse, which is showing a clear seasonal decline in mid-summer. Recent demand (Periods 17-23) has stabilized at a significantly lower level, averaging 48.3 units per week, which is lower than the previous regime (~67) and the historical seed data (~100+). Specifically, the last three periods (P21-23) show demand of 36, 33, and 39 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 182, In-transit: 116), which is more than sufficient to cover the next (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current rate (5 * 48 = 240 units total needed vs 298 available). I am setting mu_hat to reflect this lower demand regime using recent_N=7 to capture the shift starting at Period 17. Sigma_hat is also adjusted using recent_N=7 to avoid over-ordering due to earlier high-volatility periods. No new order is likely to be triggered by the OR backend given the current surplus, which is appropriate for a softening seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: Average demand has stabilized at ~48 units per week, significantly lower than the P1-P13 average of ~90 and P14-P16 average of ~67.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Women's Blouse) is in a clear summer low-demand regime. Demand since Period 17 has stabilized at a significantly lower level (average ~47 units) compared to earlier in the year. In Period 25, we have 197 units on-hand and 63 units in-transit (orders from P21 and P22), totaling 260 units. With an estimated weekly demand of ~47 units and a 4-period lead time, our inventory position covers more than 5 periods of demand (47 * 5 = 235). The OR backend's inventory balancing will likely result in a zero order given the high current stock relative to the new demand regime. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8, covering P17-P24) to accurately reflect the current stabilized demand of ~47 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). The SKU 697054003 (Womens Blouse) has entered a stable low-demand regime since early June (Period 17). Over the last 9 periods (P17-P25), the demand has averaged approximately 39.7 units per week, significantly lower than the early-season average of ~90. The most recent five samples (P21-P25) are even lower, averaging 36.4 units with very low volatility. With 206 units currently on hand and only 18 units in transit (ordered in P22), the inventory position is extremely high relative to current demand (over 5 weeks of coverage). My goal is to allow the OR engine to wind down this excess stock to avoid high holding costs ($1/unit). I will use the most recent 9 samples (since the regime shift at P17) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the confirmed lead time of 4. The high on-hand balance will naturally prevent the OR engine from placing new orders until inventory levels normalize.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple recent arrivals (P20 arriving in P24, P21 in P25, P22 in P26). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 17, averaging 41.1 units over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), with a slight uptick to 53 in the most recent period. Given the on-hand inventory of 171 units and 23 units in-transit (Total coverage: 194 units), we are significantly overstocked relative to the current weekly demand (approx 4-5 weeks of coverage). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1 (z-score for 0.8 service level is ~0.84). To allow inventory to bleed down towards more efficient levels while maintaining service, I will use the recent demand regime (last 10 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Method L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 17 to 26 has averaged 41.1 units, significantly lower than the P1-P13 average of ~90.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19th. The product is a long-sleeved blouse, which is entering its primary autumn season. Historical demand shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-16 averaged ~90 units/week, then dipped significantly during the summer (P17-P25 averaged ~41 units/week). However, the last two periods (P26 and P27) show a sharp increase to 53 and 60 units respectively, signaling the start of the autumn demand recovery. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand is 111 with 79 in-transit. To capture this upward trend while maintaining a high service level (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use the recent_N method for demand (mu_hat) with N=4 to include the summer low and the recent uptick, and I'll use the calculate method for lead time as it has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery initiated: Demand increased from summer average of ~41 to 53 (P26) and 60 (P27) as of August 12th.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697054003' (Woman's Blouse) is entering the Autumn season. Demand has clearly transitioned from a summer low (~41 units/week) to an increasing trend: P26: 53, P27: 60, P28: 68. This is a sustained upward trend over the last 3 weeks as we approach September. To capture this recovery, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to weigh the most recent high-demand weeks heavily. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (arriving during the 4th period after ordering). With an on-hand inventory of 43 and demand rising, the current pipeline must be maintained to avoid stockouts during the transition to higher autumn demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery confirmed and accelerating: Demand increased sequentially from 53 (P26) to 68 (P28), averaging ~60 units over the last 3 weeks compared to the summer average of ~41.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Womens Blouse) is entering the high-demand autumn season. Recent demand in Periods 26-29 (53, 60, 68, 71) confirms a significant upward trend, averaging 63 units over the last 4 weeks. This is a clear recovery from the summer average of ~41. At the start of Period 30, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in Period 29 (sold 43 vs 71 demand). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have a clear, accelerating regime shift, I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the autumn recovery mean (~63 per week, total ~315 for L+1). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' (N=4) to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. This will signal the OR engine to place orders sufficient to cover the rising demand and rebuild the safety stock depleted by the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery confirmed and accelerating: Demand in Periods 26-29 (53, 60, 68, 71) averaged 63 units, a 50% increase over the summer average of ~41. Stockout occurred in Period 29.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's blouse, which is currently experiencing a strong autumn demand recovery. Demand has increased from a summer low of ~41 to 90 units in Period 30, following a sequence of 53, 60, 68, 71, and 90. This indicates a clear upward trend as we enter September. Stockouts occurred in Period 29 and 30 due to this accelerating demand. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the recovery period starting P26) to capture this higher mean (~68.4 units/week), and using explicit for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P26 order arrived P30). Pipeline inventory is 272 units, which should help mitigate the current stockout as they arrive over the next few periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery is accelerating: Demand reached 90 units in Period 30 (Date: 2019/9/2), exceeding the late summer average by over 100%. Two consecutive periods of stockouts (P29, P30) confirmed.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697054003' (Womens Blouse) is experiencing a strong autumn demand recovery. Demand in the last two periods (P30, P31) was 90 and 80 units, respectively, following a summer low of ~41. We have experienced three consecutive periods of stockouts (P29-P31) because the on-hand inventory (starting at 43, 23, and 56 respectively) could not meet the surging demand. Although we have 307 units in-transit, the current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the transition into mid-September, demand is expected to remain high, similar to the start of the year (P1-P4 mean was ~118, though recent weeks are slightly lower at ~85). I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current upward trend (avg ~77 per week), and sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the increased volatility during this recovery phase. This will signal the OR backend to place larger orders to recover the service level and rebuild safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: Demand for the last 3 periods (P29-P31) has averaged 80.3 units, resulting in three consecutive stockouts as arrivals (ordered during summer lows) fail to meet the recovery trend.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's blouse, which is entering its autumn peak season (September). Historical data shows a clear demand recovery starting Period 26. Since Period 30, demand has averaged approximately 84 units (90, 80, 82), representing a significant increase over the summer average of 41. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for 4 consecutive periods) because the orders arriving now were placed during the low-demand summer regime. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this new high-demand regime (Periods 30-32). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (Periods 30, 31, 32). The high pipeline inventory (335 units) will gradually resolve the stockout as the larger orders placed from P28 onwards begin to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 30: Average weekly demand has increased to approximately 84 units (+100% vs summer average), leading to persistent stockouts as summer-cycle orders arrive.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Womens Blouse) is experiencing a severe structural demand surge as it transitions into the autumn season. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 137 units, significantly exceeding the previous 'recovery' average of ~84 units. We have encountered five consecutive periods of stockouts (P29-P33) because summer-cycle orders were insufficient for this autumn peak. The 'In-transit' inventory of 355 units reflects my recent aggressive ordering, but since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, these units are only beginning to arrive. Specifically, the order from P30 (77 units) should arrive during P34, but current demand is likely to exceed that. To address the stockouts and the new demand level, I will shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the most recent 4 periods (P30-P33) which capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~111 units). This will help the OR backend raise the base stock level to match the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated P33: Weekly demand spiked to 137 units, averaging ~111 units over P30-P33 (a 32% increase over the previous recovery average of 84).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Despacito Blouse' is currently experiencing a dynamic autumn demand recovery. We've seen a significant regime shift starting around Period 30, with demand peaking at 137 (P33) before settling at 65 in Period 34. However, the last 5 periods (P30-P34) have had an average demand of 90.8 units [90, 80, 82, 137, 65]. The low demand in P34 (65) might be an outlier or a temporary dip, but given the product is a long-sleeved blouse, autumn/winter seasonality suggests sustained higher levels compared to the summer lows of ~41. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 420 units includes orders from P31 (91), P32 (94), P33 (93), and P34 (142). To protect against the highly volatile demand seen recently (std dev of the last 5 periods is ~27), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the new average (approx 91/week), and set sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the high recent volatility. This provides a base_stock target intended to cover (4+1)*91 = 455 units plus safety stock, which aligns with the current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand for P30-P34 is 90.8 units (+120% vs summer average), characterized by high volatility (std dev ~27).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Womens Blouse) is transitioning through an autumn peak. Demand spiked significantly between Periods 30-33 (averaging ~97 units) but has softened over the last two weeks (P34: 65, P35: 54). This suggests we have passed the initial autumn surge but remain above summer levels. The average demand for the current regime starting at the recovery (P26-P35) is 76 units. However, looking at the last 6 periods (P30-P35), demand has been highly volatile (mean 84.6, std 29.8). Current on-hand inventory is 49 with 403 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the stockout phase P31-P34). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To avoid over-ordering as demand softens while protecting against volatility, I will use a recent_N (N=6) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-summer regime. This will adjust the base stock to account for the L+1 (5 period) risk window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak passed; demand softening from P33 peak (137) to recent levels (P34: 65, P35: 54). Current regime (P30-P35) average is 84.6 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a women's blouse, which saw a significant demand peak in September (average ~111 units near P33) and is now softening as we move deeper into October (P34-P36 demand: 65, 54, 60). The current demand regime (P34-P36) averages 59.7 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual observations (P32 order arrived P36). With on-hand inventory at 83 and in-transit at 335 (covering approximately 5.6 weeks of current demand), the goal is to stabilize the base stock around the current lower demand level while maintaining a buffer for late autumn volatility. mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the post-peak stabilization (averaging ~60), and sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility compared to the September spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized post-Autumn peak: Average demand for P34-P36 has decreased to ~60 units per week (-34% vs P30-P33 peak average of 91).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Despacito Blouse' has transitioned from a high-volatility autumn peak (averaging 111 units in Sept) to a more stable post-peak regime. In the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has been 65, 54, 60, and 74 units, averaging 63.25 units. This suggests the autumn surge is subsiding. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P33 order arriving in P37. Pipeline inventory is currently 293 units (orders from P34: 142, P35: 74, P36: 26, P37: 51). With an expected arrival of 142 units in Period 38 (ordered P34), the on-hand inventory (102) will significantly increase. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the current ~63 unit demand level, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this post-peak stabilization. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the September spike.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak demand regime (P34-P37) confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~63 units per week, down from the P30-P33 peak average of ~97.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Despacito Blouse' has stabilized into a post-autumn peak regime. Current analysis of the last 5 periods (P34-P38) shows demand of 65, 54, 60, 74, and 66, resulting in an average of 63.8 units per week. This aligns with the previous insight that the peak (which hit 137 in P33) has passed. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 178 units, with 151 units in-transit (P35: 74, P36: 26, P37: 51). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting this stable post-peak regime. This should maintain a balance between meeting demand and minimizing holding costs as we head further into November.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Blouse in woven fabric' has entered a new phase following the Autumn peak (P30-P33 avg: 97) and the subsequent stabilization (P34-P37 avg: 63). Data from the most recent periods (P37-P39) shows a further decline in demand (74, 66, 35), likely reflecting a seasonal transition out of early Autumn/Back-to-school into late Autumn/Winter. The demand of 35 in P39 is the lowest since early summer. To avoid building excess inventory (holding cost $1.0 vs profit $4.0 favors lean inventory), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the last 3 periods (P37-P39) to capture this downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Pipeline inventory is currently balanced against expected lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P39: Demand dropped to 35 units, signaling a transition out of the Autumn regime (avg ~63) into a late Autumn/Winter low.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Womens Blouse) has entered a late Autumn/Winter demand low. Demand in Period 39 and 40 dropped to 35 and 37 units respectively, confirming a significant shift from the previous 'Autumn recovery' regime which averaged ~63 units. This drop aligns with the seasonal transition observed in the carry-over insights for Period 40. Given the current high on-hand inventory (206 units) and the presence of 88 units in-transit, the system is overstocked relative to this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) captures the current downward trend (averaging ~46 over P38-P40) to prevent further excessive ordering while we bleed off the existing surplus. High holding costs ($1.0) vs. profit ($4.0) further justify a conservative replenishment approach during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 39: Demand has dropped to an average of ~36 units per week (P39-P40), marking the start of the Winter low-demand period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Blouse in woven fabric' is currently in a Winter low-demand regime, which began around Period 39 (early November). Recent demand samples (P39-P41: 35, 37, 24) show a clear stabilization around a mean of approx 32 units, a significant drop from the Autumn average of ~63. Current on-hand inventory is high (233 units), which is more than enough to cover the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) without additional ordering. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the high on-hand stock, the goal is to allow inventory to deplete. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the current low-demand regime and use default settings for lead time and sigma.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in Winter low starting P39: Average weekly demand has decreased to ~32 units (P39-P41), down from the Autumn average of ~63.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive and unexpected demand spike of 137 units, which mirrors the peak seen in Period 33. This suggests either a late-season promotion, a holiday surge (early December/Cyber Week), or high volatility in the current winter regime. While the previous three weeks (P39-P41) averaged only 32 units, this spike is too large to ignore. However, the 'Despacito' blouse is a seasonal item entering the deep winter/holiday period, and overcompensating with high base stock might lead to excessive holding costs if this was a one-off event. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to include this spike in the average (averaging ~58 units per week) while acknowledging the increased volatility. On-hand inventory is 96 and in-transit is 37 (total 133). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting parameters to pivot slightly toward this higher demand while maintaining caution against overstocking at the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Sudden demand spike in Period 42: Demand reached 137 units, matching the previous Autumn peak, contrasting with the P39-P41 average of 32.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Women's Blouse) is entering the high-demand December holiday period. Period 42 saw a sudden spike to 137 units (matching the previous peak), and Period 43 demand remained elevated at 74 units, significantly higher than the previous winter low of ~32 units. We are seeing a mid-December demand acceleration. On-hand inventory is low (26 units) following these spikes. The OR backend needs to account for this higher regime (mu_hat) and increased volatility (sigma_hat) to prevent stockouts during the lead time (L=4). I will use a recent window (N=5, covering P39-P43) for mu_hat to capture the shift from low to high demand, while using an explicit sigma_hat of 45 to reflect the high volatility observed between the 137 and 74 demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed for December: Demand jumped from a winter low of ~32 to 137 (P42) and 74 (P43), signaling a high-volatility peak regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45). Demand history shows a significant shift starting Period 42 with a spike of 137 units, followed by 74 and 26. While Period 44 saw a drop to 26, the 'Carry-over Insights' and the 'Blouse' description suggest high volatility and potential for holiday-related surges. The goal is to set parameters that can absorb this volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime (P42-P44 mean ~79), but to avoid overreacting to the single low P44 data point while acknowledging the spike, I'll set mu_hat to an explicit value of 450 (which is (L+1) * 90) to ensure we maintain a buffer for the remaining periods. I will use explicit sigma_hat of 120 to account for the high variance (137 vs 26). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak (Date: 2019-12-23). Demand history shows a high-volatility surge starting around P42 (demand 137). Since then, demand has remained elevated and volatile (P43: 74, P44: 26, P45: 75). The product, a 'Blouse in woven fabric', is likely a high-demand item for Christmas/New Year events. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 420 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with recent observations (P44 saw arrival of P40 order). To capture the current holiday regime and prepare for potential post-holiday clearance or sustained winter interest, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (covering periods 42-45). This balances the extreme spike of 137 with the more moderate recent values. The OR backend will use these values to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) periods of this high-volatility demand.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P45) is characterized by high volatility (range 26-137) and an average of ~78 units/week, significantly higher than the previous winter low of ~32.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-to-late holiday season (late December). The holiday regime (P42-P46) has shown a significant demand increase compared to the early winter low, with an average demand of approximately 73 units/week (down from the initial spike of 137 but sustained by recent values of 74, 26, 75, 53). However, there is a mismatch between demand and inventory: we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced two consecutive periods of stockouts (P45, P46) because recent orders haven't arrived. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P44 arrival). The pipeline is full (476 units), but we must ensure future base stock covers this higher volatility regime. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5, covering the start of the holiday surge) which averages ~73 units/period, and setting sigma_hat using the same period to account for the high volatility (137 vs 26). This will maintain a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts as we head into the new year.

Carry-over insight: New Year transition: Holiday regime (P42-P46) average demand confirmed at ~73 units/week with high volatility (std dev ~42). Stockouts in P45-P46 due to demand exceeding summer/autumn-level arrivals.
