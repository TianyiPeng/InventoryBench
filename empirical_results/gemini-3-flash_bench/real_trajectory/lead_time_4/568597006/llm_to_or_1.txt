Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the Hayes slim trouser, a professional staple. Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a baseline around 80-90 units, with a slight peak to 115 in late January. The average demand across the five provided samples (79, 80, 88, 115, 80) is 88.4 units per week. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the OR backend targets a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the 'default' method for L incorporates the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat, since we are moving into mid-February, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent mean demand. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to provide a baseline for safety stock. There are no missing shipments or complex lead time data yet as it is Period 1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'Hayes slim trouser', a women's tailoring item. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a mean of approximately 88 units/week. In Period 1, we experienced a demand of 71 units, which resulted in lost sales since we started with 0 on-hand inventory. An order of 114 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since there is no actual lead time data yet (the first order is still in-transit), I will use the promised lead time (L=4). For demand forecasting, the recent data points (79, 80, 88, 115, 80, 71) suggest a relatively stable mean around 85 units. Given the seasonality of trousers/tailoring in mid-February (approaching Spring), demand is expected to remain steady or slightly increase. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent trend while smoothing out the spike from late January.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand for this item (Women's Hayes slim trouser) has shown a significant recent increase: historical mean was ~88, but the last two periods recorded demand of 71 and 123. The 123 figure in Period 2 suggests a shift or high volatility as we enter late February, possibly aligning with early spring season garment needs. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet (Promised lead time L=4). Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 229 (orders from P1 and P2). Since L=4, the P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5. To ensure we have enough stock to meet demand when arrivals start, I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 (covering recent historical and game history) to capture the higher demand trend. L is kept at 'default' (4) as we have not yet observed any arrivals to suggest a deviation from the promised timing.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's tailored trouser, entering early March which typically sees stable demand for professional wear. Historical demand samples (79, 80, 88, 115, 80) and game history demand (71, 123, 90) suggest an average weekly demand of approximately 90 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (114 units), Period 2 (115 units), and Period 3 (140 units) are currently in-transit (Total 369). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4) and become visible in the Period 6 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. I will set mu_hat based on the average of all available samples (including history) which is approx 90.5 per period. Since L=4, mu_hat = (1+4) * 90.5 = 452.5. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of recent demand samples (~17) scaled by sqrt(1+L), approx 38. L is set to default (4).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a pair of women's suit trousers. Historical demand samples (before P1) were 79, 80, 88, 115, 80. Observed demand during the game (P1-P4) has been 71, 123, 90, 63. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we started with 0 inventory and used an order-up-to policy, we have been stocking out for 4 periods waiting for the first arrival. The first order (placed in Period 1) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (4 periods later). We will see this in the Period 5 conclude message. Currently, there is 488 units in-transit (114+115+140+119), which covers the pipeline. I will set L to the default (4). For mu_hat, demand has been somewhat volatile (range 63-123), but there is no clear sustained regime shift yet. Using the recent 5 samples (P4 demand + 4 historical) provides a balanced view of recent performance. sigma_hat will also use the last 5 samples to capture this volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is 'Hayes slim trouser', a women's tailoring item. Historical demand (P1-P5) shows a mean of 90.4 units/week. The P1 order arrived at the start of P5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 9 units, with 399 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Since the lead time is L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The average demand across all samples (including the seed data) is around 88.5 per week. There's no clear evidence of a significant regime shift yet, as demand fluctuates between 63 and 123. However, with very low on-hand inventory and the next arrival (P2 order) expected in P6, we should maintain a robust stock position. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (averaging 90.4) and 'default' for sigma_hat and L.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is 'Hayes slim trouser', a women's tailoring item. Historical demand (P1-P6) has been: 71, 123, 90, 63, 105, 95. The average demand across these 6 periods is ~91.1. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and consistent with this, orders from P1 arrived in P5 and P2 arrived in P6 (Lead Time = 4). There is currently 29 units on-hand and 399 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). The backend uses a base-stock policy. Since the product is professional/business wear, we are moving into the spring season where demand for 'Womens Tailoring' typically stabilizes or slightly increases. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility and mean, and use 'calculate' for Lead Time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a women's slim trouser. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a stable range: [105, 95, 78] (post-stockout) and [71, 123, 90, 63] (pre-stockout). Mean demand over all 7 periods is approx 89.2. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving exactly after 4 periods (P5, P6, P7). On-hand inventory is 91, and in-transit is 368 (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). As we enter April, there's no immediate major seasonal spike expected for basic workwear until late spring/summer, but we must maintain stock. I'm using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-stockout demand reality more accurately than the full history, which includes early noisier data. This sets the base stock level to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/08. Demand for the 'Hayes slim trouser' has remained relatively stable over the last 8 periods, with a mean of 91.6 units and no clear seasonal trend yet established for early spring. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1-4. The ordering goal is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Mean demand across 5 periods (L+1) is approximately 458 units. Pipeline inventory (102 on-hand + 281 in-transit) is 383 units. I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-initial-stockout demand behavior while maintaining a 4-period lead time setting.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The item is a semi-formal women's trouser. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Periods 5-9) has been 105, 95, 78, 108, and 62, averaging 89.6 units/week. Including the pre-inventory data (79, 80, 88, 115, 80) and early game history (71, 123, 90, 63), we see a stable but slightly fluctuating demand without a clear seasonal breakout for this specific mid-spring window yet. The lead time is confirmed as a consistent 4 periods (validated across 5 consecutive deliveries). Current on-hand is 65, with a pipeline of 381 (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). As the target service level is high (q \u2248 0.95), I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) for demand forecasting (mu_hat) to capture the most recent variability while smoothing out the lower demand from last week. sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect recent volatility. L remains at the promised/confirmed value of 4.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/22. The product is Women's Tailoring suit trousers. Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged around 86 units, but the most recent 6 periods (since stock became available) show a slightly lower mean of 85 units and a downward trend in the last two weeks (62, 63). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by all arrivals from Period 5 through 10. In-transit inventory is 340 (orders from P7, P8, P9, P10), and on-hand is 117. Given the stable lead time and the recent slight decrease in demand volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=6) to focus on the post-stockout performance, while maintaining default lead time logic.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's tailored slim trouser. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed in P7-P11). Demand analysis shows a declining trend in recent weeks: samples P1-P4 averaged 86.75, P5-P8 averaged 96.5, but the most recent three periods (P9-P11) averaged 60.3 (62, 63, 56). This likely signals a post-spring surge cooling or a shift in the local demand regime for this specific item. Given the current on-hand inventory (170) and pipeline (276), our inventory position is strong. I will set the demand forecast using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current lower demand level and prevent over-ordering while maintaining the observed lead time L=4. This helps the OR backend avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 9: average weekly demand decreased from ~96 to ~60 (-37%).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The carry-over insights correctly identified a demand regime shift starting Period 9 (late spring). Previous average demand was approximately 96 units (P1-P8), while the last four weeks (P9-P12) have seen a shift, although Period 12 showed a spike to 110. Averaging the demand from Period 9 to 12 (62, 63, 56, 110) gives a mean of 72.75 units. This is slightly higher than the previous insight of ~60 but still significantly lower than the early period average. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P1-P8 orders). On-hand inventory is 92, with 244 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11). I will set L to 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the lower spring demand regime while acknowledging the recent spike. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility observed in the last period.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Historically, the Hayes slim trouser (suit trousers) experienced a demand regime shift around Period 9. Pre-P9 demand averaged ~91 units/week, while P9-P13 has averaged ~73.6 units/week. However, the last two weeks (P12: 110, P13: 77) show a Slight resurgence compared to the earlier slump. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (approx 5 * 74 = 370 units). On-hand is 140 and In-transit is 233, totaling 373 units, suggesting we are well-positioned but should maintain the pipeline for the lower demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the post-shift demand levels and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (May 20, 2019), we are managing Hayes slim trousers, a formal women's tailoring item. Demand analysis shows a shift around Period 9. The average demand from Period 1-8 was approx 96 units, while from Period 9-14 it settled at approx 77 units (excluding the P12 spike of 110 which appears as an outlier or minor seasonal bump). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 117 units on-hand and 235 in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, P14), the pipeline is well-saturated. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current demand regime (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) since Period 9. Lead time L will remain at the promised/confirmed 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's suit trouser. Historical data shows a lead time consistently at 4 periods. A demand regime shift was noted around Period 9, where the average weekly demand dropped from ~96 to ~77 based on the last 7 samples (P9-P15: 62, 63, 56, 110, 77, 97, 60). Although an earlier insight suggested a drop to ~60, the actual mean of the last 7 periods is 75, exhibiting significant volatility (std dev ~20). Given the lead time L=4, we must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. On-hand is 102 and In-transit is 304 (Orders from P12-P15), totaling a pipeline of 406. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures the current lower but volatile demand regime better than a long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to reflect this current volatility. No missing shipments are observed as arrivals match orders perfectly with a 4-period lag (P11 order arrived in P15).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 17 (2019/6/3). The product is a women's suit trouser. Historical data shows a lead time of 4 periods (L=4). However, in Period 16, no units arrived, although we expected an order placed in Period 12. Reviewing the history, the order quantity for Period 12 was actually 0, which explains why no units arrived in Period 16. The pipeline currently holds 350 units (ordered in periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). The demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 9. The average demand from Period 9 to 16 is approximately 78.5 units per week, which is higher than the previously noted '60' in carry-over insights but lower than the initial weeks. Specifically, the last 4 weeks (P13-P16) averaged 72.75 units. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this sustained lower-demand regime since Period 9. For lead time, I will stick to the confirmed 4 periods. Setting L=4 and using recent demand trends will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers (4+1) periods of demand while accounting for the current on-hand inventory (45) and high in-transit amount (350).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 9-16 stabilized at an average of ~78 units/period, down from ~90+ in early periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a women's suit trouser. Demand has stabilized over the last 9 periods (P9-P17) with an average of approximately 69.7 units per period, showing a clear reduction from the earlier average of ~90 units. Period 16 showed a missed shipment from Period 12 (though Period 12 ordered 0 units, so 'arrived=0' is expected), and Period 17 confirmed the lead time remains 4 periods (P13 order arrived in P17). I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower/stable demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. Pipeline inventory is currently 280 (P14, P15, P16, P17 orders), and on-hand is 114.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 9-17 stabilized at an average of ~70 units/period (specifically 69.77), confirming a significant and sustained drop from the initial period average of ~90.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 568597006 (Hayes slim trouser) has shown a sustained decrease. From Period 9 to 18, the average demand has stabilized at approximately 69.8 units per period, a significant drop from the early period average (P1-P8) of 92.9. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, although a missing/delayed order from Period 12 (0 units ordered) was confirmed as skipped in actual arrivals, and the Period 13 order arrived on time in Period 17 (lead_time=4). Current on-hand (151) and in-transit (237) total 388 units, which covers approximately 5.5 periods of the current average demand. To account for the lower stable demand regime and prevent overstocking, I will use recent_N with N=10 (covering Period 9 through 18) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the lower mean and reduced volatility observed since April.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for 'Hayes slim trouser' has seen a significant and sustained drop. The average demand across the last 11 periods (P9 to P19) is approximately 62 units, with the last three periods (P17-P19) showing even lower demand (45, 39, 36). Current on-hand inventory is high at 229 units, and 150 units are in-transit. An order from Period 12 (0 units) was resolved at P16, but an order from Period 16 (46 units) is still in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 20 or 21. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, total relevant demand window is L+1=5 periods. My estimated demand for this window is approximately 300 units (60 * 5). Inventory (229 on-hand + 150 in-transit) significantly covers this. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand levels using N=11 (from the P9 regime shift) to prevent over-ordering while maintaining a service level for the current low-demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P17-P19) has dropped further to ~40 units/period (specifically 40.0), down from the ~70 units/period calculated in Period 18.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 568597006 (Suit trousers) has shown a significant downward trend as we move into summer. Initially averaging ~90, it dropped to ~70 around Period 9, and has further plummeted to an average of 38.25 over the last four periods (P17-P20: 45, 39, 36, 33). This is likely a seasonal decline for formal trousers. Inventory is currently high with 242 units on-hand and 129 in-transit, totaling 371 units of pipeline inventory. Given the current demand rate of ~38/week and a lead time of 4 periods (5 weeks of coverage needed), the required base stock is approximately 38 * 5 = 190 units. Since 371 units already exist in the pipeline, the system will not place new orders. To reflect the most recent demand regime and minimize holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to track the last 4 periods (N=4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17 confirmed: Average demand has fallen to 38.25 units/period (P17-P20), a further 45% decrease from the previous ~70 unit average.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 22 (July 8, 2019). The demand for 'Hayes slim trouser' has entered a new, significantly lower regime starting around Period 17 (early June). In the latest concluded period (P21), demand was 72 units, which is a jump from the previous four-week average of ~38, though still well below the early-year average of ~90. The on-hand inventory is currently high at 214 units with 85 more in-transit (orders from P18, P19, and P20). Total pipeline inventory is 299 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we are looking at (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. Using the most recent 5 samples (P17-P21) which average 45 units/period, the total expected demand over the lead time is approximately 225 units. Since 299 > 225, we are currently overstocked and the OR cap should naturally result in a zero or near-zero order to minimize holding costs. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 17 is averaging 45.0 units/period (P17-P21), which is a significant drop compared to the ~70 units/period observed from P9-P17.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Hayes slim trousers (SKU 568597006) showed a significant drop between Periods 17-20 (avg ~38), but has rebounded in the last two periods (P21: 72, P22: 89), likely due to mid-summer retail trends or promotions. Since Period 17, the demand average is approximately 55.8 units/period. The current inventory position is high: On-hand (158) + In-transit (52) = 210 units. Given an average demand of ~56 and a lead time of 4 periods, our pipeline inventory covers roughly 3.75 periods, which is close to the (L+1)=5 requirement but accounts for the recent demand surge. I will use recent_N (N=6, covering the P17-P22 regime shift and recovery) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will sensitize the OR backend to the higher demand observed in the last two weeks while acknowledging the preceding slump, preventing excessive stock-outs if the upward trend continues while avoiding over-ordering if it stabilizes. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected: After a slump averaging ~38 units (P17-P20), demand increased to 72 and 89 in P21-P22, yielding a new regime average of 55.8 since Period 17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1255.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a recovery from a slump observed between Periods 17 and 20 (average ~38). In the last three periods (P21-P23), demand has risen to 72, 89, and 72, respectively. The current average demand for the 'recovery' regime (P21-P23) is approximately 77.6, which aligns more closely with the earlier Period 9-16 regime (~78) than the recent slump. Given the product is 'womens tailoring' (trousers), this volatility is notable. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this upward rebound and prevent stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical concludes (Period 19 order arrived in Period 23). Currently, on-hand inventory is 113, with 115 in-transit (P20, P21, P22, P23 orders), totaling a pipeline of 228. Setting L to default (4) and sigma_hat to recent_N=7 to reflect the increased volatility seen across the slump and recovery.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed starting Period 21: average demand increased to 77.6 (P21-P23) from the Period 17-20 slump of 38.25. The current demand level is consistent with the P9-P16 regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Hayes slim trouser' has returned to a moderate level after a mid-summer slump (P17-P20). Recent demand figures (P21: 72, P22: 89, P23: 72, P24: 52) suggest an average demand of approximately 71.25 units per period over the last 4 weeks. This recovery aligns with the previous stable regime (P9-P16) which averaged ~78. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as verified by recent arrivals from P17, P18, P19, and P20. However, the order from P12 (0 units) means there will be no arrival visible in Period 17 (already passed). Looking ahead, our pipeline includes orders from P23 (90) and P24 (115), but we have a gap from P21 and P22 where 0 units were ordered. Current on-hand is 86. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Given the recent recovery to ~71 units/period, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current post-slump demand level while maintaining sigma_hat based on the same period to account for the increased volatility seen during this recovery.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery starting Period 21 is sustained: average demand for P21-P24 is 71.25 units/period, returning to levels similar to the P9-P16 regime (~78) after the P17-P20 slump (~38).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Hayes slim trouser', a women's suit trouser. Calendar context (August) suggests we are entering the 'Back to School/Work' season, often characterized by a demand increase for tailoring. Demand has returned to a higher regime (~72 units/period in the last 5 periods: 72, 89, 72, 52, 92) compared to the June/July slump (~38 units/period). Period 25 ended with 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout (demand 92, on-hand 86), making it critical to maintain an adequate pipeline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current recovered demand regime (P21-P25), which aligns with historical averages around 72-78 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Stockout occurred (demand 92 vs 86 on-hand). Confirmed demand recovery starting Period 21: average demand for P21-P25 is 75.4 units/period, showing seasonal strength entering August.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's suit trouser, currently entering mid-August. We are in a confirmed demand recovery/growth phase (August seasonality). Demand in the last two periods (P25-P26) reached 92 and 93 units, confirming the surge identified in 'Carry-over insights'. However, we have a critical supply issue: on-hand inventory is 0, and shipments from Period 21 and 22 (the zero-order periods) were expected but effectively resulted in no arrivals during P25-P26. Specifically, the order placed in P21 was 0, and P22 was 0. Arrival resolution: P21 order (0 units) would arrive P25 conclude; P22 order (0 units) would arrive P26 conclude. This explains the current 0 on-hand. We have 404 units in-transit (orders from P23-P26). The first major arrival (P23's 90 units) is expected at the start of Period 28. To capture the current higher demand regime (~92 units/period) and account for the 4-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P21-P26) which averages ~78 units, but I will use an explicit slightly higher forecast to ensure the base stock covers the recent peak demand of ~90+ to prevent further stockouts. sigma_hat is set to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply gap confirmed for P25-P26 due to zero-orders in P21-P22. Demand sustained at ~92 units/period in early August (P25-P26), indicating seasonal strength for office wear/tailoring.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568597006 (women's suit trousers) is experiencing a period of high seasonal demand as August progresses, likely driven by 'back-to-work' or 'pre-fall' shopping. In Period 27, we observed a massive demand spike to 179 units, which is a record high for the series. This followed a stockout situation in Periods 25-26 caused by gaps in ordering in P21-P22 (where 0 units were ordered). While the 179 might include some 'pent-up' demand from previous stockouts, the rolling trend from Period 21 onwards (72, 89, 72, 52, 92, 93, 179) clearly shows a regime shift compared to the summer slump. The average demand over the last 7 weeks is ~92.7 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (In-transit) is 420. Given the high demand and the stockout risk, I am selecting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this higher demand regime, and using explicit sigma_hat set to a higher value (45) to account for the extreme volatility (179 units) and ensure the OR backend increases the base stock to cover both high mean and high variance during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected Period 27: demand reached 179 units, signaling strong seasonal peak. Average demand since Period 21 recovery has stabilized at ~93 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Hayes slim trouser' is experiencing a significant seasonal peak associated with the late August/September 'back-to-office' or 'autumn wardrobe' period. Demand in the last two periods spiked to 179 and 140 respectively, significantly higher than the previous recovery average of ~75. The mean demand over the last 8 periods (since the recovery in Period 21) is approximately 98.6 units, but the most recent 4 periods (P25-P28) average 126 units. Stockouts occurred in Period 25 and have persisted through Period 28 (despite arrivals) because existing supply cannot meet this increased demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent prolonged stockouts during this peak, I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the elevated post-recovery demand and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (179 vs 92) seen during the current peak. This will raise the base stock level significantly while keeping the ordering policy responsive to the current seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal peak confirmed: Demand averaged 159.5 over the last two periods (P27-P28), doubling the previous regime average. On-hand remains 0 due to persistent stockouts.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Hayes slim trouser' (Womens Tailoring) has entered a significant seasonal peak associated with the late-August/early-September 'Back to Office' period. Demand in the last three periods (P27-P29) has been 179, 140, and 138 respectively, averaging 152.3 units/period. This is a dramatic increase from the summer average of ~75. Although on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts, arrivals have resumed (90, 115, and 97 units in the last three periods). Given the current date (Sept 2), we are likely at the height of the seasonal demand. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this high-demand regime (152.3 * 5 = 761.5). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to reflect the high volatility during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal peak confirmed (P27-P29): Average demand increased to 152.3 units/period, roughly doubling the previous recovery regime of ~75 units. This coincides with the late-August/September 'Back to Office' retail cycle.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Hayes slim trouser' is in its peak seasonal demand phase, likely driven by 'Back to School/Office' trends in late August and September. Demand has surged and sustained at a high level: Period 27 (179), P28 (140), P29 (138), and P30 (147), following a recovery regime. The average demand over these last 4 peak periods is 151 units/period. The current in-transit inventory (583 units) is substantial, but given the 4-period lead time and 0 on-hand inventory, we must ensure we cover the total pipeline needs (L+1 periods). Calculated average demand for the most recent 4-period regime (N=4) is 151. Setting mu_hat to capture this high-demand state is critical to replenish stock and prevent further lost sales, despite the holding cost risk, as profit ($19) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1). L remains stable at 4 periods based on historical consistency.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal peak (P27-P30) confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at 151 units/period, exactly double the previous recovery regime (~75).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2014.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a strong seasonal peak, likely driven by 'Back to Office' and Autumn retail cycles for tailored trousers. Demand has surged significantly, with Period 31 reaching 211 units. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) is 163 units, compared to the previous regime of ~75. On-hand inventory is 0 due to persistent stockouts, making accurate forecasting critical to capturing lost sales. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 660) is substantial, consisting of large orders placed recently (P28-P31: 118, 168, 191, 183). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P27-P31) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~163). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility during this peak. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1) at the current high demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal peak (P27-P31): Average demand has reached 163 units/period, with a new high of 211 in P31. This confirms a very strong demand regime, up from the ~151 average reported in P31.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Hayes slim trouser' (Womens Tailoring) is currently in a high-intensity seasonal peak, likely driven by the 'Back to Office' and Autumn retail cycle. Demand has increased sequentially over the last few periods: 147 (P29), 211 (P30), and now 249 (P31). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is approximately 184.8 units, which is a significant increase from the previous average of ~150 and nearly double the earlier August levels. Given this accelerating upward trend as we move further into late September, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for this momentum. I will use a forecast of 220 units per period (across the L+1 window of 5 periods), resulting in a mu_hat of 1100. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (calculated as approximately 112 per period * sqrt(5)) to provide a buffer against the high volatility observed during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal peak acceleration (P27-P32): Average demand has increased to 184.8 units/period, with the most recent period (P32) reaching a peak of 249. This indicates a stronger-than-expected tailoring season peak compared to the initial 150-unit estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3192.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Hayes slim trouser' is in its peak seasonal regime (late September/early October), which aligns with the 'Back to Office' and Autumn tailoring cycle. Demand exploded in Period 33 to 479 units, significantly exceeding the previous peak of 249. This indicates an accelerating exponential trend rather than a flat peak. The carry-over insights correctly identified a doubling of demand, but the most recent data shows a nearly fourfold increase from the initial recovery levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture the most recent massive demand spike (479 units) as the new baseline for the next (L+1) periods, preventing ongoing stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 100 to account for high volatility during this peak. Pipeline inventory is currently 993, but with demand running at 400-500 per week, a 5-period window (L+1) requires approximately 2000-2400 units to avoid loss of sales.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal peak acceleration (P27-P33): Demand reached an extreme peak of 479 units in P33, indicating a much higher seasonal ceiling than previously estimated. The average demand since Period 27 has now climbed to 226.7 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3569.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Hayes slim trouser' is in its peak seasonal regime (Back to Office/Autumn layering). Period 33 saw an extreme demand spike of 479, followed by a pullback to 188 in Period 34. While the 479 may be an outlier or a specific event, the moving average since Period 27 is 221.9 units/period. The current pipeline is 1355 units, but stockouts have been frequent. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is required. I will use recent_N (N=8, covering the peak since P27) to capture the seasonal mean while moderating the extreme P33 influence. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to capture the current high-demand state to ensure the OR backend's base-stock captures the necessary volume.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak demand (P27-P34) currently averages 221.9 units/period, showing high volatility (range 138-479). The regime is significantly higher than the previous recovery average of ~75.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3354.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand seasonal peak (late August through October), likely driven by 'Back to Office' or autumn tailoring trends. Demand shifted significantly in Period 27, with the average since that point being 221.9 units. There was an extreme outlier in Period 33 (479 units), but recent demand in Period 34 (188) and Period 35 (177) suggests the peak may be plateauing or starting to decelerate. However, because lead time is 4 periods, we must still cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Period 32\u2019s order (215 units) is expected to arrive this period (P36), which is not yet visible in the conclude messages but will help alleviate the low on-hand stock of 9. Given the recent stabilization between 175-190 units over the last two weeks, I will use a recent_N of 9 (capturing the entire peak regime from P27-P35) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which provides a mean demand of ~222. This balances the extreme spike of P33 with the more moderate recent observations while maintaining a safe buffer for continued high seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak (P27-P35) averages 221.9 units/period. Recent data (P34-P35) shows stabilization around 180 units after a Period 33 extreme peak of 479.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand seasonal peak (Womens Tailoring/Trousers) which began around Period 27 (late August). Demand peaked in Period 33 (479 units) but has since stabilized in the P34-P36 range (188, 177, 176 units). The average demand over this entire peak regime (P27-P36) is 214 units, though the last three periods average 180 units. Given the inventory position (on-hand 48, in-transit 1228), we are finally seeing large historical orders arrive (P32 order of 215 arrived last period). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To maintain stock as we approach the end of the game (P47) while accounting for the stabilization of the peak, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=10 to cover the entire peak regime (P27-P36), providing a robust average of ~214 units. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to capture the high volatility seen durant this peak (479 units vs 138 units).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak (P27-P36) stabilized after P33 extreme outlier, with the last 3 periods (P34-P36) averaging 180.3 units compared to the regime average of 214.0.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Hayes slim trouser' has entered a stable seasonal peak regime following a massive outlier in Period 33 (479 units). For the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has leveled off, averaging 186.25 units (188, 177, 176, 204). This suggests the extreme peak was transitory, but the baseline remains much higher than the previous recovery levels of ~75. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 248 units, and with 962 units in-transit (including large orders from periods 34 and 35), the pipeline is well-stocked. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the stabilization over the last 4 periods, I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-spike plateau accurately, ensuring we don't over-order based on the P33 outlier while maintaining sufficient stock for the current 180-200 unit demand level.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed (P34-P37): Following the extreme demand spike in P33, demand has stabilized at an average of 186.25 units/period for the last 4 weeks.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Hayes slim trouser' has entered a post-peak stabilization phase following the extreme seasonal surge in late September (Period 33). For the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has been remarkably consistent, averaging 183.8 units/period (values: 188, 177, 176, 204, 174), confirming a shift away from the high-volatility peak of 479 units. Inventory is now healthy with 627 units on-hand and 409 in-transit, largely thanks to the arrival of the large Period 34 order. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the stabilization, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the last 5 settled periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the policy reflects the current 184-unit demand level rather than the historical average or the extreme outlier.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization confirmed (P34-P38): Demand has leveled to an average of 183.8 units/period after the late-September peak, with significantly reduced volatility compared to the P27-P33 surge.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Tailoring' (suit trousers) has clearly entered a post-peak stabilization phase following the 'Back to Office' seasonal surge (August-October). The latest demand data (P34-P39) shows a consistent level averaging 178.5 units/period (188, 177, 176, 204, 174, 149), which is lower than the volatile peak regime (~220) but higher than the summer recovery level (~75). We are currently in a high inventory state (On-hand: 617) due to large orders placed during the peak arriving now (P34 order of 553 arrived P38, P35 order of 139 arrived P39). With 617 units on hand and 270 units in transit (expected arrivals from P36-P37), our total pipeline of 887 units is more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) at the current average demand of ~178. We must maintain a cautious approach to avoid excessive holding costs as the season potentially winds down further in late November. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this post-peak stabilization (P34-P39), while keeping L at default as lead times remain stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed (P34-P39): Demand has settled to an average of 178.5 units/period after the late-quarter seasonal peak, with a slight downward trend observed in the most recent period (149).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a 'post-peak stabilization' phase following the extreme tailoring demand spike in Period 33. The most recent demand (Periods 34-40) has averaged 175.4 units, showing a gradual cooling trend from the earlier peak. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 591) due to the large orders placed during the peak arrival periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this stabilized post-peak behavior (P34-P40), which reflects the current demand level better than the all-time average or the extreme spike period. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to account for the reduced volatility observed since the stabilization began. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization (P34-P40) confirmed: Demand has settled to an average of 175.4 units/period with significantly lower volatility than the P27-P33 seasonal surge.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (2019/11/18), the 'Hayes slim trouser' has entered a post-peak stabilization phase following the intense seasonal demand of late August and September. Demand over the last 8 periods (P34-P41) has averaged 168.6 units, but the most recent four periods show a clearer downward trend (174, 149, 158, 119), suggesting the seasonal peak has fully passed. The current on-hand inventory of 610 units plus 214 units in-transit (Total = 824) is significant. Given the 'Back to Office' tailoring season typically concludes by year-end, I am moving to a more conservative demand estimate to avoid excessive holding costs as we approach Period 47. I will use the recent_N method with N=8 to capture the post-peak mean (approx 168.6), which, when combined with the OR backend's service level calculation, should naturally reduce orders while inventory is high. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P34-P41) confirmed: Average demand has moderated to 168.6 units/period, down from the peak regime (P27-P33) average of 226 units, with a noticeable downward trend into late November.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive and unexpected demand spike of 408 units (Date: 2019/11/25). This aligns with 'Black Week' retail trends for tailoring/office wear. Consequently, our on-hand inventory has dropped to 202 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 327 reflects the orders placed in Periods 40, 41, and 42 (70 + 144 + 113). Since P38 and P39 had zero orders, we are currently in a supply gap that will last until the P40 order arrives in P44. The recent demand regime (P34-P41) had slowed to 168.6 units, but the P42 spike (408 units) necessitates a more responsive forecasting approach to ensure we don't stock out during the December holiday season. I am using EWMA_gamma with gamma=0.7 for mu_hat to quickly weigh the recent spike while acknowledging the previous stabilization, and recent_N=9 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of the last few months including the P33 and P42 surges.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Secondary demand spike detected Period 42 (408 units), likely corresponding to 'Black Friday/Cyber Monday' retail events. This breaks the post-peak stabilization trend and increases short-term volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1618.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Hayes slim trouser' (Womens Tailoring) has entered a more volatile phase following the late-November holiday demand spike (Period 42 demand: 408). While Period 43 demand settled to 91, the current date (Dec 9) is within the peak holiday shopping season, suggesting demand will remain elevated and unpredictable compared to the October/November stabilization. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical evidence. The backend OR policy needs to account for this higher recent volatility (sigma) and a mean demand that balances the recent spike with the subsequent drop. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the broader late-season average (~180) and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to specifically account for the high variance introduced by the recent 408-unit spike. With 111 units on-hand and 699 in-transit, the pipeline is substantial, but high safety levels are required to prevent stockouts during the remainder of the December peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand remains volatile during December peak; Period 42 spike (408 units) confirms high seasonal variance despite one-off Period 43 drop (91 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2939.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/09), demand was 156, following a volatile period (P42: 408, P43: 91). The average demand over the last 11 periods (P34-P44) is 181.8 units/period, but excluding the P42 Black Friday spike (408), the average is 159.2. Given we are in mid-December (2019/12/16), we expect demand to remain seasonally strong but potentially stabilize as we move past major holiday shopping events. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (25), but there is a large pipeline (1002) including orders from P41 (144), P42 (113), P43 (372), and P44 (373). The order from P41 is expected to arrive in Period 45. To avoid excessive overstocking as we exit the peak season while maintaining a sufficient service level for the remaining December periods, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat (N=11) to capture the current high baseline, and a recent_N for sigma_hat (N=11) to account for the high volatility seen in the Black Friday spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Post-Black Friday demand (P42-P44) remains highly volatile (range 91-408), but the baseline average since P34 (post-September peak) has stabilized around 180 units/period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (late December). Recent demand (P42-P45) has been highly volatile due to holiday sales events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday and Christmas lead-up), with demand spikes like 408 units in P42 and more stable levels around 158 units recently. The average demand for the post-peak regime (P34-P45) is approximately 172 units/period. The pipeline is currently 1040 units, reflecting large orders placed in P42-P45 to handle the holiday surge. Given we are approaching the end of the game (P47 is the final period), and lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will not arrive before the game concludes. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable post-peak average to ensure the OR engine maintains a sensible base stock, though the primary goal is now managing the existing pipeline and on-hand inventory (11 units) against the one remaining period of demand.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility (P42-P45) confirmed with a spike of 408 units and a baseline averaging ~160 units; overall post-September peak average (P34-P45) is ~170 units/period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). Demand is transitioning from the holiday peak (Black Friday/December) into the post-holiday January period. Historical samples from early 2019 (Jan 7 - Feb 4) show a mean demand of 88.4 units. Recent demand (P43-P46) has cooled from the P42 spike (408 units) to an average of 121.25 units. Given the product is 'Womens Tailoring Suit Trousers', January typically sees a modest 'return to work' demand but generally lower than the Q3/Q4 peak. I am projecting a forward demand of ~100 units per period (mu_hat = 500 for L=4) to account for this transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have a massive pipeline (1062 units) from heavy ordering in P43-P45, and current inventory is 44, the OR backend will correctly modulate the final order based on the existing in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition detected: Demand cooling from December volatility (P42-P45 avg ~203) towards early-year baseline (historical Jan avg ~88).
