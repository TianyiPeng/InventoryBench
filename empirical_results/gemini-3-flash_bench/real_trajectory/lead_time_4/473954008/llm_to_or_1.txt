Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'OP Cheeky hipster 2p' (Womens Lingerie). Historical demand samples are: 77, 60, 50, 23, 42. There is a visible downward trend in the last few weeks, possibly moving from the post-holiday/early-year period into a lower baseline. The mean of all 5 samples is 50.4, but the average of the last 2 samples is 32.5. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using all 5 samples (N=5) provides a more robust estimate for a starting position than just the most recent low points, while reflecting the inherent volatility. The backend will calculate the base stock using the provided L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat parameters to maximize profit vs holding cost. Initial on-hand and in-transit are 0, so the first order will be significant.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's lingerie item (Microfibre hipster briefs). Historical demand samples show a downward trend (77, 60, 50, 23, 42). In Period 1, actual demand was 53, but 0 were sold because on-hand inventory was 0. An order of 84 units was placed in Period 1 with a promised lead time (L) of 4. This order is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 (visibility in Period 6). Since we have no on-hand inventory and the lead time is 4, we need to ensure the pipeline covers demand for the next L+1 (5) periods. Given the recent demand samples (23, 42, 53), the mean is approximately 39.3. I will set L to the promised 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current demand level (~40/week), resulting in a base stock calculation covering 5 weeks of demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, following two periods of stockouts where 0 units were sold despite demand (53 in P1, 69 in P2). The promised lead time is 4. Total in-transit inventory is 149 (84 from P1 + 65 from P2). These orders are not expected to arrive until Period 5 (P1 order) and Period 6 (P2 order). We need to maintain a pipeline that covers demand for (L+1) periods. The historical demand samples (77, 60, 50, 23, 42) plus recent realized demand (53, 69) show a mean of ~53 units/period. For mu_hat, I will use a conservative forecast because 2019-02-25 is post-Valentine's Day, typically a cooling period for lingerie, but we must protect against stockouts once shipments arrive. Sigma is based on the variability of all 7 available samples (std dev ~17.5). I am using 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the full recent context.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The SKU (Womens Lingerie) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, the first shipment is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the lead time gap, resulting in lost sales (all demand so far has been lost). Total in-transit is 232 units (84+65+83). Demand samples show: Jan (77, 60, 50, 23), Feb (42, 53, 69, 29). The February mean is ~48.25. Given L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=5 for demand statistics captures the most recent trend including the Feb samples. No shipments have concluded yet, so we stick to the promised lead time 'default'.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The SKU '473954008' is women's microfibre hipster briefs. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P5 and will be visible at the start of P6. Consequently, on-hand inventory has been 0 for the first 4 periods, resulting in lost sales. Significant in-transit inventory (285 units) exists, covering orders from P1-P4. Current historical demand (including the seed data) shows: 77, 60, 50, 23, 42 (seed) and 53, 69, 29, 43 (observed), with a total mean of approximately 49.3 units/period. There is no strong evidence yet that actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods, nor is there a clear seasonal shift in this 'staple' lingerie item. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand mean and variance while covering (1+L) periods, which is (1+4)=5 periods of demand. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock level that accounts for the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (arrived during Period 5), confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Current on-hand is 39 units, with 207 units in-transit. Demand for the last 5 periods has been [53, 69, 29, 43, 45], averaging 47.8 units/period. The pre-game samples [77, 60, 50, 23, 42] average 50.4 units. There is a slight downward trend, but demand remains relatively stable for women's lingerie (Microfibre hipster briefs) in early Spring. With L=4, the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) = 246 units. This covers roughly 5 periods of demand (47.8 * 5 = 239). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime which is slightly lower than the initial historical data. Lead time will remain at 'default' since the observed delivery matched the promised 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is Women's Lingerie (hipsters). Reviewing the history: The promised lead time is 4. Observations from the 'conclude' messages for Periods 5 and 6 confirm the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). Demand has been somewhat volatile but lacks a clear seasonal trend in this short window; recent samples are: 53, 69, 29, 43, 45, 24. Since demand started at 53/69 and has dipped recently to 45/24, using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=6 (the full window of current dynamics) is appropriate to capture the mean (~43.8). For sigma_hat, using recent_N=6 captures the standard deviation of this same period. We currently have 80 on-hand and 189 in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). The lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the observed 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is women's microfibre hipster briefs. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Periods 3-7) has been 29, 43, 45, 24, 38, averaging 35.8 units/period. The initial samples from early 2019 were higher (approx 50-70), suggesting a slight downward regime shift to a more stable baseline. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on 'Period conclude' messages for orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3. On-hand inventory is 125, which covers roughly 3.5 periods of demand at the current rate. In-transit is 117 (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), with P4's order of 53 units expected to arrive during the current period (P8 resolution). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 242 units, covering (125+117)/35.8 \u2248 6.7 periods. Since L=4, we need coverage for L+1=5 periods. We are currently well-stocked. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma to capture the current lower-demand regime while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean weekly demand decreased from ~60 to ~36 units starting around Period 3. Lead time confirmed as stable at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The SKU is 'OP Cheeky hipster 2p', a women's lingerie staple. Demand has stabilized at a lower level (~36 units/week) compared to the initial weeks (~62 units/week). The confirmed lead time is 4 periods, which means we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Currently, On-hand = 148 and In-transit = 64 (representing orders from P5, P6, P7), totaling 212 units. With demand around 35-40, we have over 5 weeks of coverage already. The OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to set the base stock; I will use recent_N=6 to capture the lower demand regime since Period 3 (Periods 3 to 8), filtering out the initial higher demand noise. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the product (Womens Lingerie) continues to follow a lower demand regime. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P3-P9) is 34.0 units, significantly lower than the initial samples (avg ~60-70). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 125, which covers current demand for ~3.6 periods. In-transit inventory is 58 (orders from P6 and P7), expected in Period 10 and 11. Given the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs. Holding $1), we need to ensure (L+1)nd coverage (5 periods). Total projected inventory (on-hand 125 + in-transit 58 = 183) covers approximately 5.4 periods of current mean demand (183 / 34). No urgent ordering is needed, and the current stock levels are adequate. I will use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime since Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the demand history for SKU 473954008 (Womens Lingerie), there was a clear downward shift in demand around Period 3 (Late February/Early March). The mean demand since Period 3 has stabilized around 33 units per period (Avg of P3-P10: 29, 43, 45, 24, 38, 30, 29, 28). Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods, with orders consistently arriving as scheduled. Currently, on-hand inventory (144) is high relative to the lower demand regime (~33/week), and there is a pipeline of 28 units (11 from P7 due P11, 0 from P8, 0 from P9, 17 from P10). Since the total inventory (on-hand + pipeline = 172) significantly exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods * 33 = 165), the primary goal is to prevent overstocking while holding a small safety buffer. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-shift demand levels accurately, and the default method for L as it matches the observed actual lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P12 (2019-04-29). The product is women's microfibre hipster briefs. Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift: initial demand (early Jan to Feb) was higher (mean ~60), but starting from late Feb (around Period 3), demand stabilized at a lower level. Over the last 9 periods (P3-P11), the mean demand is 32.33 units per week with a standard deviation of approximately 7.6. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P1-P7 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 130 units, and in-transit is 40 units (orders from P10 and P11). Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean of ~32, expected demand over the horizon is ~160 units. Current inventory+pipeline is 170 units, which is slightly above the expected base stock for this low-volatility period. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the stabilized lower demand regime since Period 3, allowing the OR engine to set the base stock based on the current mean and variance while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are managing SKU 473954008 (Womens Lingerie). The Carry-over Insight from Period 8 correctly identified a demand regime shift starting around Period 3/4. Prior to Period 3, demand averaged ~60; since Period 3, the demand has stabilized around a lower mean. Looking at the last 10 samples (Periods 3-12), the mean demand is 33.6 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 12) was 40, which is slightly above the recent average but within normal variance for this category. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11). The arrival for Period 12 was 0, which is consistent with the '0' order placed in Period 8. We currently have 90 units on-hand and 61 units in-transit (orders from P9: 0, P10: 17, P11: 23, P12: 21). Total pipeline and on-hand inventory is 151 units. Given (L+1) = 5, and a mean demand of ~34, the inventory position of 151 units covers approximately 4.4 periods of demand, which is close to the target service level. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and 'default' for L since the promised lead time of 4 is holding steady.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '473954008' (Cheeky hipster briefs) has shown a stable demand regime since Period 3, with a mean demand of approximately 34-36 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by historical arrivals (Periods 5-11). There were no arrivals in Period 12 and 13 as no orders were placed in Period 8 and 9 respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory (73) plus pipeline inventory (104) equals 177 units. At a forecast of ~35 units/period, this covers ~5 periods of demand, which aligns well with the L+1 (5) lead-time coverage requirement. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (Period 4 through 13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the default lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $310.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains lower than the pre-game history, with the average demand from Period 3 to Period 14 being approximately 30.7 units per week. Recent demand (P12-P14) has dipped slightly further to an average of 25.7, but I will maintain the N=12 window to capture the stable regime since Period 3. Lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P1 through P7 and P10 all arrived with LT=4). On-hand inventory is 70, and there are 104 units in transit (ordered P11-P14), totaling 174 units. Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy targeting (1+L) periods of demand, and 174 units covers roughly 5.6 periods of current average demand (174 / 30.7 \u2248 5.67), our inventory position is healthy against the (5) period look-ahead (L=4 + current period). I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-shift demand levels accurately while maintaining L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~31 units/period since Period 3 (confirmed through Period 14). Lead time remains highly stable at 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P16 (2019/5/27). Demand in Period 15 spiked significantly to 70 units (the previous regime mean was ~31). This jump is possibly due to the Memorial Day holiday timeframe or a seasonal lingerie promotion. However, one data point is not yet a confirmed regime shift. I will treat this as a high-volatility event. On-hand inventory is low (23), but pipelined units (94) are arriving. The confirmed lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=13, from P3 onwards) to capture the lower-demand history while allowing the backend to account for the recent spike's effect on variance. L is set to 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $836.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we experienced a stockout (demand 72, sold 44, ending on-hand 0) due to a sudden demand surge in the last two periods (70 and 72 units vs. the previous average of ~31). This surge corresponds to the late May/early June period, which often sees increased lingerie sales due to seasonal shifts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 12 order in Period 16. With on-hand at 0 and 130 units in-transit (Orders from P13, P14, P15, P16), we must account for this new higher demand regime. I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this spike (Avg: (40+70+72)/3 = 60.67), translating to an L+1 mu_hat of ~303. This will trigger the OR backend to place orders that replenish stock and cover expected high demand until the in-transit units arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Average weekly demand increased from ~31 to ~71 units (+129%) likely due to seasonal factors in late May.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand seasonal regime that began around Period 15 (late May/early June). Current demand in the last three periods (P15-P17) has been 70, 72, and 78 units respectively, averaging ~73 units/period, compared to the previous regime of ~31 units. The inventory is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) with 190 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 13 order in Period 17. To respond to this significant shift, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand mean of ~73, resulting in a base stock targeted for (1+4) periods. Sigma_hat is also updated using recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. This approach ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to meet the ~365 unit requirement for the lead time plus review period (5 * 73), while the cap will prevent excessive ordering once the pipeline fills.

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a major seasonal demand surge in June (Womens Lingerie), with demand jumping from ~31 to ~70+ units/period starting Period 15. On-hand inventory is currently depleted (0) because previous order quantities were based on the lower demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current pipeline of 254 units covers orders from Period 15 (13 units), Period 16 (57 units), Period 17 (103 units), and Period 18 (81 units). The Period 15 order (13 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 19. Since demand is currently elevated (last 4 periods: 70, 72, 78, 52; mean ~68), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility associated with the higher mean. These parameters will signal the OR backend to place larger orders to recover from the stockout and maintain service levels for the (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 15 (late May), with weekly demand averaging 66.4 units (70, 72, 78, 52, 60) compared to the previous average of ~31 units. The product is out of stock (On-hand: 0) because recent arrivals (17, 13 units) were based on orders placed during the low-demand period, while current demand is significantly higher. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have a 5-period window (P15-P19) for this new regime, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (66.4) and volatility. The OR engine will factor in the large in-transit pipeline (328 units), which contains the larger orders placed since Period 16, to eventually stabilize the stock level.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~66 units/week) sustained for 5 periods (P15-P19) following late May seasonal shift.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 15 (late May/early June). Since Period 15, weekly demand has consistently averaged approximately 65 units (70, 72, 78, 52, 60, 58). We are currently stocked out (Ending On-hand: 0) and have been losing sales in the last five periods because arrivals have not kept pace with this demand spike. The lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by the conclusion of orders from P12, P13, P14, P15, and P16). To recover service levels and prevent further lost sales during this sustained high-demand phase, I am selecting mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (P15-P20) to capture the current mean of ~65 units/period. Over (1+L) = 5 periods, this equals 325. Setting L to default (4) and using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this specific regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Microfibre hipster briefs' shifted significantly higher starting in Period 15 (late May), with an average demand of approximately 62.1 units over the last 7 periods (P15-P21). This is likely a seasonal summer peak. Although demand dipped slightly in Period 21 to 47 units, the overall regime remains much higher than the previous baseline of ~31 units. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods based on systematic arrivals from Period 1 to 17. Currently, on-hand inventory is 56, with a substantial pipeline of 259 units (orders from P18-P21). To maintain the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio during this high-demand season, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time which matches observed behavior.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in a high-demand regime that began around Period 15 (late May). Demand samples from P15 to P22 are: 70, 72, 78, 52, 60, 58, 47, 63. The mean of these 8 samples is approximately 62.5 units/period. The lead time remains highly stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P22 arrival from P18 order = 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 74, and there is a high pipeline of 217 units (orders from P19-P22). To maintain appropriate stock for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this sustained high-demand regime, ensuring we stay ahead of mid-summer demand for this lingerie SKU.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (2019/7/22), the SKU is in a sustained high-demand regime that began in late May (around P15). Demand has averaged ~63 units/week over the last 9 periods (P15-P23), compared to the previous ~31 units. The most recent demand (P23) was 85 units, and in-transit inventory is currently 277 units (P20-P23 orders). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the product is a staple (cheeky hipster briefs) and we are in the peak summer season, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this higher mean of ~63 units/period while accounting for the recent variability (sigma_hat, N=9). This ensures the base stock calculation, covering L+1 (5) periods of demand, is responsive to the current seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer high-demand regime sustained (P15-P23): Mean demand increased to ~63 units/week, up from ~31 units pre-May.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 15 (late May), likely driven by seasonality for 'Cheeky hipster' lingerie during the summer months. Recent demand (P15-P24) averages approximately 66 units per week. The lead time is very stable at 4 periods. Since P21, inventory levels have improved but remained relatively lean relative to the high seasonal demand. Total pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 233 units, while on-hand is 44. To ensure sufficient stock for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), and accounting for the higher volatility observed in this regime (demand ranging from 47 to 85), I am using a recent_N calculations focused on the last 10 periods (P15-P24) for both demand and volatility to capture this peak summer behavior.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P15 onwards) has stabilized around an average of 63.5 units per week (Last 11 samples: 70, 72, 78, 52, 60, 58, 47, 63, 85, 75, 47). While demand fluctuates between ~47 and ~85, there is no clear evidence of a significant new shift at Period 26. The lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods, with all orders from Period 1 to 21 arriving precisely on schedule. We are currently in early August; historical data elsewhere suggests high summer demand for lingerie items may continue until late August. Currently, on-hand inventory is 45 units and pipeline inventory is 271 units. To maintain service levels for a high-demand regime with lead time 4 (covering 5 periods of demand), I will use the recent 11-period window (N=11) to capture the current seasonal mean (~63.5/week) and volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '473954008' (Cheeky hipster briefs) is entering mid-August. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal shift that started in late May (around Period 15), where average demand jumped from ~31 units/period to ~63 units/period. However, the last two periods (P25 and P26) have shown lower demand (47 and 34 units), suggesting the high summer peak may be cooling off or reverting to a lower baseline. Using recent_N=12 for mu_hat captures the entirety of the high-demand summer regime (P15-P26) to ensure we don't under-order if the recent dip is just volatility, while sigma_hat (recent_N=11) accounts for the increased variance seen during this period. On-hand inventory is 50, and 285 units are in-transit (covering orders from P23-P26). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateauing: The late-May seasonal surge (avg ~65) shows signs of softening in August (P25-P26 avg ~40), though 3+ periods are needed for a confirmed regime shift.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Microfibre hipster briefs' has entered a new lower-regime phase as the summer season ends. Comparing the high-demand period (P15-P24 avg ~65) to the most recent three periods (P25-P27: 47, 34, 36; avg ~39), there is a significant and sustained drop of approximately 40%. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 23 order in Period 27. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward shift immediately and avoid overstocking while demand plateaus into the autumn season. This will allow the OR backend to recalculate the lower base stock required for the L+1 window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: Mean weekly demand decreased from ~65 to ~39 units (-40%) as summer peak concludes.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for this lingerie SKU is transitioning out of its summer peak. In 'Carry-over Insights', a demand regime shift was confirmed at Period 25, where the mean dropped from approximately 65 to 39 units per week. The last four periods of demand (47, 34, 36, 60) average 44.25 units. Although Period 28 saw a spike back to 60, the overall trend supports the shift identified in the carry-over insight. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this lower average (approx 44 units) while allowing for the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on the history of successful arrivals from Periods 1 through 24. With on-hand inventory at 100 and in-transit at 170, the system is well-stocked for the current demand level. Setting L to default (4) and sigma_hat to recent_N=14 to capture the volatility from both the summer peak and the recent decline, ensuring a sufficient safety stock without excessive holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 473954008 is entering September. Historically, demand showed a high-demand regime from Period 15 to 24 (avg ~65), followed by a cooling period starting Period 25. However, the last two periods (P28-P29) have seen a bounce back to higher demand (60 and 70 units), suggesting that the 'post-summer drop' observed in P26-P27 (avg ~35) might have been a temporary dip rather than a sustained lower regime, or that school-season/September factors are boosting demand. I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for mu_hat (avg ~49 units) to balance the recent volatility between high and low signals. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the most recent five arrivals (P25-P29 all arrived with lead_time=4). Setting L to default (4) and sigma_hat to recent_N=5 to capture the increase in demand variance.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand patterns have been volatile recently. While a shift to a lower mean (~39) was observed in August (P25-P28), demand in the most recent two weeks (P29-P30) spiked back to 70 and 56 units respectively. This suggests either high volatility or a stabilizing demand regime around 50-60 units as we transition out of summer. Given the high profit margins ($19) versus low holding costs ($1), maintaining a higher service level is optimal. I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods (P25-P30) to capture this latest 'post-peak summer' behavior, which yields an average demand of approximately 50.5 units per period. The lead time remains highly stable at the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on N=6 ensures the OR backend accounts for the recent demand fluctuations while maintaining sufficient safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in June.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late August/early September: After a brief drop in early August (avg ~39), demand rose again (P29-P30 avg 63), suggesting a stabilized post-summer mean around 50-55 units rather than a return to spring lows.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '473954008' (Womens Lingerie - Hipster briefs) is currently in Period 32 (mid-September). Historically, we saw a summer peak (P15-P24, avg ~65) followed by a brief August dip. However, demand has rebounded and stabilized over the last 7 periods (P25-P31: 47, 34, 36, 60, 70, 56, 51) with a mean of 50.57 and a standard deviation of approximately 13.5. This suggests a post-summer steady state around 50-55 units. On-hand inventory is 93, and in-transit is 157 (representing orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31). Lead time is highly stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the target service level is high (~95%). Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures this stabilized post-summer regime, while recent_N=7 for sigma_hat accounts for the current volatility. Lead time remains default (4).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift (P25-P31): Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~51 units/period after the August volatility, higher than the spring baseline but lower than the summer peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-23. Demand has entered a post-summer stable regime since Period 25 (August 26), with an average demand of approximately 51 units/period (P25-P32 samples: 47, 34, 36, 60, 70, 56, 51, 41; mean = 49.3). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 52 units, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 208 units, totaling 260 units. This current position covers roughly 5 periods of forecasted demand ((1+L) * 51 = 255), which aligns with the target. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (since Period 25) to capture this new regime's mean and volatility while excluding the higher summer peak. This will allow the OR backend to maintain a service level appropriate for the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) following a demand spike of 79 units in Period 33, which exceeded the available 60 units. As of Period 34 (late September), the demand regime has stabilized around a mean of ~51 units/period after summer volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 33 of the order placed in Period 29. However, there is a missing shipment from Period 28 (which was an order of 0 units, so technically not missing, but it means no arrivals occurred in Period 32). The in-transit pipeline is 233 units (orders from P30-P33). To recover from the stockout and handle the current demand regime (~51 units), I will set mu_hat based on the last 9 samples (P25-P33) which captures the post-summer stabilization (average ~53 units). Lead time remains at the default promised 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Period 34 concluded with a demand of 47 units. The post-summer demand regime (P25-P34) shows a mean of approximately 51.4 units/period with significantly higher volatility (std ~14.8) compared to spring. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P30 order arriving exactly in P34. However, Period 33 suffered a stockout because the order from Period 28 (86 units) never arrived (missing from concluding messages for P32 and P33). This missing shipment has significantly depleted on-hand inventory (28 units) while the pipeline remains large (236 units). I will continue using the post-summer demand regime (N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for high-profit items, accounting for the recent higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Potential lost shipment: Order from Period 28 (86 units) failed to arrive by Period 33 (L=4) or Period 34 (L=5); pipeline inventory count may be inflated if this order is permanently lost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stabilized post-summer demand regime (mean ~51 units/period since Period 25). However, a significant supply chain issue is flagged: the order from Period 28 (86 units) is now 3 periods overdue (L=7 vs promised L=4) and is likely lost. The OR backend's 'cap' and order logic use pipeline inventory; if this 86-unit order is lost but still counted in the 'In-transit' block (212 units), the system will severely under-order, leading to stockouts. By setting an 'explicit' L of 7, I attempt to force the backend to recognize a longer replacement cycle, but more importantly, I must ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent demand regime (N=11 for Period 25-35). Because 86 units are likely missing from 'In-transit' (effective pipeline is ~126, not 212), I use 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure we maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period lead time risk window (L+1) without being suppressed by the 'ghost' inventory of the lost shipment. Demand remains steady at ~51, so mu_hat is set to 51 * (4+1) = 255. Sigma is set to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Order from Period 28 (86 units) has not arrived as of Period 35 (L=7). Pipeline inventory is artificially inflated by 86 units; ordering parameters must account for this shortfall until the record is cleared or compensated.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-summer regime with a mean of approximately 51 units (P32-P36 demand: 41, 79, 47, 52, 58). Lead time for delivered orders remains consistent at 4 periods. However, the order from Period 28 (86 units) is officially categorized as a lost shipment (it is now Period 37, making it 9 periods since the order was placed with no 'conclude' message). The OR backend's inventory balancing logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) is currently 'blind' to this loss, seeing a pipeline inventory of 236 units that includes 86 units that will never arrive. To correct for this, I must adjust mu_hat or sigma_hat to force an order that compensates for the 86 lost units. Since the backend order logic is [base_stock - pipeline_inventory], and my target base stock for the current regime (L=4) would normally be around 255-275 units (5*51 + safety), the system currently thinks I have 43 (on-hand) + 236 (pipeline) = 279 units, resulting in a zero or minimal order. To force an order that replaces the 86 lost units, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus the lost 86 units. Expected demand (5 periods * 51) = 255. Correction: 255 + 86 = 341. I will set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current volatility of the post-summer regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28. We are in a post-summer demand regime that started around Period 32, with a mean demand of approximately 64 units per week (P32-P37: 41, 79, 47, 52, 58, 93). On-hand inventory is currently 0, largely due to a stockout caused by high demand in P37 (93 units). One shipment from Period 28 (86 units) is definitively lost, which artificially inflates the 'In-transit' figure shown by the system. Total pipeline inventory correctly accounted for is 207 units (293 - 86). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($19) vs. holding cost ($1), we prioritize a high service level. mu_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the current elevated demand mean (~64 units), and sigma_hat uses recent_N=6 to reflect the increased volatility (std ~18). This will signal the OR backend to replenish inventory aggressively to cover the stockout and prepare for sustained late-autumn demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift confirmed (P32-P37): Mean demand increased to ~64 units/period, up from the previous ~51 unit estimate. High volatility persists (std ~18).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 39 (early November). Demand for this womens lingerie item has entered a higher-volume regime since Period 32, with an average demand of approximately 64 units per period (P32-P38: 41, 79, 47, 52, 58, 93, 69). Volatility remains significant. Regarding the supply chain, the order of 86 units from Period 28 is confirmed lost (L=10 with no arrival). This means the 'In-transit' figure of 305 units is artificially inflated by 86 units, as the backend OR logic cannot see this loss. Consequently, current visible 'pipeline inventory' is actually ~219 effective units (305 - 86). To compensate and prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will adjust mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the 64-unit mean, and I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to manually account for the lost 86 units by temporarily elevating the base stock target to trigger a larger replenishment order. Given L=4, the pipeline should cover 5 periods (L+1). Target stock \u2248 5 * 64 + safety. I will set mu_hat to 406 (calculated as (1+L)*64 + 86) to force the OR engine to 'replace' the lost shipment.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11, entering the late autumn/pre-holiday season. Demand has been elevated since Period 32, with a mean around 64 units (observed: 58, 93, 69, 54 in the last 4 weeks). Pipeline inventory is currently 367 units, but this includes the confirmed lost shipment of 86 units from Period 28. To correct for this, I will adjust the lead time L to 'explicit' and set it slightly higher or manipulate mu_hat to ensure the backend orders enough to compensate for the 86 lost units. However, given the OR backend's formula (base_stock - pipeline), the most effective way to address a 'hole' in the pipeline is to increase the mu_hat forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the post-summer shift including recent volatility) to capture the current mean of ~64. Since the on-hand is very low (5 units) and we are entering a potentially high-demand season (November), I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L)*70 to provide a slight buffer above the recent mean, ensuring the system covers the missing units and maintains service levels.

Carry-over insight: Mid-November demand remains strong (avg ~64) with consistent stable lead time of 4 periods (excluding the P28 anomaly).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18. Demand analysis shows a post-summer mean of approximately 64 units/period (P32-P40 avg ~58, with recent months showing higher spikes up to 93). While Period 40 demand was low (32), the overall trend since October has been strong. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the exception of the confirmed lost order from Period 28 (86 units). Pipeline inventory stands at 335 units, but this includes the 86 lost units, so the functional pipeline is 249 units. With on-hand inventory at 48, the effective inventory (on-hand + functional pipeline) is 297 units. To cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at a mean of ~64, we need ~320 units. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the stable post-summer regime since Period 32) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and the higher mean, while using 'explicit' L=4 to maintain stability despite the one-off lost shipment.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), the SKU remains in the post-summer demand regime established around Period 32. Calculating demand from P32 to P41, the mean is approximately 53.6 units/period with a standard deviation of ~17.8. Demand in the most recent five weeks (P37-P41) has averaged ~56 units. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture this established regime, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Note that the order from Period 28 (86 units) is officially confirmed as lost, having passed the L=4 threshold by 10 weeks. The OR backend includes 'In-transit' in its base stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline). Currently, in-transit is 245 units. If the backend still counts the lost P28 order, the pipeline is inflated by 86, which will cause it to under-order. To compensate for this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 354 (calculated as (1+4) * 53.6 + 86). This forces the backend to recognize the 86-unit shortfall by effectively raising the target stock by that amount.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 473954008 is entering early December. Historical analysis shows a demand regime shift around Period 32, with mean demand stabilizing at ~61 units/period (based on P32-P42 average) and sustained through the mid-November lull. As we approach the December holiday season, demand for 'Womens Lingerie' typically rises. One shipment from Period 28 (86 units) is definitively lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 232 includes a ghost order. Actual effective pipeline is 232 - 86 = 146 units. On-hand is 138. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (except for the lost P28 order). To account for the holiday surge and the lost shipment, I will use an explicit L of 4 and an explicit mu_hat reflecting a slight seasonal uplift (forecasted weekly mean of 65 * (1+L) = 325). Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand has shown a notable softening in the last four weeks (P40-P43: 32, 32, 58, 24; avg ~36.5) compared to the mid-autumn peak (avg ~64). With Christmas and Year-End approaching, 'Womens Lingerie' typically sees gift-related demand, but the immediate trend is declining. On-hand inventory is high (226) following the arrival of a large P39 order (112 units). The pipeline (146 units) consists of orders from P40 (43), P42 (77), and P43 (26). Note that the 'confirmed lost' order of 86 units from P28 is no longer influencing the calculation of active pipeline arrivals. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock and the upcoming end of the simulation (Period 47), I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand trend (N=6, capturing the transition from the peak to current levels) while maintaining default L=4 to avoid over-ordering during the final periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=12) to account for the consistent volatility observed throughout the second half of the year.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: Mean weekly demand decreased from ~64 to ~37 units (-42%) heading into December, indicating a post-autumn cooling period prior to potential holiday spikes.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 473954008 (Womens Lingerie) has entered a lower demand regime since Period 40 (mid-November), with a mean demand of approximately 37 units per period compared to the previous ~64 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (230 units), covering roughly 6 periods of expected demand. A lead time of 4 periods remains the stable norm (with the exception of the historical Period 28 anomaly). Given the current inventory levels (230 on-hand + 103 in-transit = 333 total pipeline) and the recent demand drop (last 5 samples: 32, 32, 58, 24, 39; mean = 37), we are significantly overstocked. Setting parameters to reflect this new lower mean (recent_N with N=5) will allow the OR backend to withhold ordering until inventory levels normalize relative to the service level goals. Explicit standard deviation is used to account for recent variability while maintaining a conservative buffer.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019). The demand regime shifted at Period 40 from ~64 units/week to ~37 units/week. However, the most recent observation in Period 45 shows a spike to 74 units, which corresponds to the pre-Christmas week\u2014a common seasonal peak for lingerie/nightwear. Since this represents a significant but likely short-lived seasonal fluctuation, I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the average reflecting both the low-December baseline and the holiday spike (avg ~40) while maintaining lead time at the stable 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (103) is correctly accounted for, and the lost shipment from Period 28 is no longer influencing the arithmetic as newer orders have arrived. The choice of N=6 for mu_hat (P40-P45) incorporates the shift to the lower baseline while partially acknowledging the recent holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike observed in Period 45 (74 units) during the post-November cooling regime (avg ~37), consistent with Christmas retail seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $967.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Dec 30, following the Christmas demand spike (detected in P45-46 with 74 and 60 units respectively). Historical patterns suggest a dip in demand immediately following the holiday season before stabilizing. The demand regime shifted at Period 40 to a mean of ~37 units, but the last two periods (74, 60) have been elevated due to seasonality. For Period 47, I anticipate demand will mean-revert towards the post-autumn baseline as the holiday peak concludes. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (covering Periods 40-46) to balance the lower November/December baseline (avg ~37) with the recent holiday spike, resulting in a conservative but responsive forecast. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P42 arrived in P46, L=4). Pipeline inventory is 63 (orders from P43 and P46), and On-hand is healthy at 173, so the OR engine will likely suggest a small or zero order to avoid excess holding costs as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed for late December (P45-46 avg 67 units); transition back to post-autumn baseline (avg ~37) expected in January.
