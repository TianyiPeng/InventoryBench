However, the demand in Period 1 (Feb 11) was 156, a significant increase that may be due to early spring shopping or Valentine's Day promotions. I expect demand to remain higher than the initial January baseline but perhaps stabilize below the peak of 156. I'll forecast an average demand of ~120 units per week. Promised lead time is 4 periods, which means the Order from Period 1 (400 units) is expected to arrive at the start of Period 5.

The late November spike is likely related to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales events. As we move into December, historical and recent trends suggest demand will remain moderate to high as holiday shopping continues, though denim often sees slightly less volatility than gift-specific categories until the post-Christmas sales. The current on-hand inventory is 236 units. There are no orders in transit. Given the 4-period lead time, any order placed now will arrive in Period 47, which is the final period of the game. For the remaining 5 periods (43, 44, 45, 46, 47), and assuming an average demand of approximately 60-70 units (balancing the recent 90-unit spike with the November average of ~50), the total expected demand is roughly 300-350 units. With 236 units currently on hand, we will likely exhaust stock before the end of the game if we do not order. Ordering 100 units now will ensure availability for the final period while minimizing the risk of excessive holding costs, as the game concludes at Period 47 and any remaining inventory will be charged final holding costs.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a pair of high-waist jeggings, which are a year-round staple but subject to holiday-driven volatility. Period 44 (Dec 9) follows a massive retail week in P42 (90 demand, likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday) and a very low P43 (19 demand). This drop is typical post-Black Friday as consumers wait for Christmas/pre-holiday sales or shipping deadlines. Historical data from early Jan (~72 avg) and the current seasonality suggest demand will moderately recover in the final weeks of Dec (P44-P46) before returning to standard Jan levels. Total periods in the game is 47, meaning only 4 periods of demand remain (P44, P45, P46, P47). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1-P35). Any order placed now in P44 will arrive in Period 48, which is after the game ends. Therefore, placing an order now is useless for satisfying any remaining demand and would only result in unnecessary holding costs or ending inventory with no further sales opportunity. With 217 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~50-70 per period for the remaining 4 weeks, the current stock is more than sufficient to cover the game's end without stockouts.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is ladies' denim jeggings, a staple item but subject to seasonal fluctuations. Current date is Dec 16. December demand has historically shown a spike for retail events (P42, likely Black Friday, demand 90) followed by a sharp drop in early December (P43-P44, avg 22 units). Given we are approaching Christmas and then the post-holiday period into early January, demand is expected to remain relatively low (typically 40-70 units based on early Jan historical samples) before a potential spring rise in February. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. My target is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With a conservative forecast of ~50 units/period for the next 5 weeks (Dec 16 - mid-Jan), total demand is ~250 units. Current pipeline (On-hand: 191 + In-transit: 100) is 291 units. This is sufficient to cover the forecast while maintaining a small safety buffer for the end of the year without incurring excessive holding costs. Therefore, no new order is necessary this period.",

{
  "rationale": "The current date is December 23, 2019, which is just before Christmas. Historically, Period 45 (mid-December) saw a demand spike to 89 units, likely reflecting late-holiday shopping, following a significant slump (avg ~22) after Black Friday (P42). As we move into the New Year transition (late December/early January), historical data from the start of the year (Jan 2019) shows demand ranging from 57 to 88 units. This suggests we are exiting the deepest part of the winter trough. Currently, on-hand inventory is 102 units. There is an in-transit order of 100 units from Period 43, which is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 47 (L=4). Therefore, total inventory coverage (on-hand + in-transit) is 202 units. Given the transition from holiday demand (90-ish) back to early-year baselines (~70), the existing 202 units should cover requirements for the next 4-5 periods (L+1 demand). No new order is needed this period to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for the beginning of January.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:

{
  "rationale": "The product is a ladies' denim item (Jeggings), which exhibits high seasonality. We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30), which is the transition from the end-of-year holiday period into early January. Historical data for January/early February from the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section shows demand levels between 57-96 (avg ~77). Recent activity showed a holiday peak (P42, P45, P46) but the most recent period (P46) showed a tapering to 72 units. January typically sees a reset to baseline demand. We have 30 units on-hand and 100 in-transit (ordered in P43, expected to arrive in P47 and be visible in P48). Current on-hand (30) + in-transit (100) = 130 units. Given the 4-period lead time, we must cover demand for P47, P48, P49, P50, and P51 to ensure continuity. Assuming a Jan baseline of ~75 units/period, the total need for 5 periods is ~375 units. Subtracting current inventory and incoming orders (130) leaves a deficit of ~245. However, since P47 is the final period of the game, any order placed now will not arrive before the game concludes (arrival would be in P51, visible P52). No order placed now will impact the total reward.",
