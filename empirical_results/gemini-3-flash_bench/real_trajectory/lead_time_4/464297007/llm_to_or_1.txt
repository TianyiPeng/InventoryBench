Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 464297007 (Greta Thong). The historical data shows a clear downward demand trend: demand was around 280-300 in early January but dropped to 189 and then 122 in the last two weeks of Jan/early Feb. Given we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to establish an initial stock position that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent lower demand levels (avg ~206) but slightly buffer it given the current low inventory. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility. L will be 'default' (4) as no historical arrival data is available yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is cotton thong briefs, a staple lingerie item. Historical demand (Jan-early Feb) averaged 217 units/week. Period 1 observed demand was 159 units, which is lower than the January average but aligns with the mid-February dip seen in the last historical sample (2019-02-04: 122). There is currently 0 on-hand inventory because we started with 0 and the Period 1 order (361 units) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since L=4, that order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible in Period 6. To set parameters, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent downward trend in demand compared to the early January peak, and 'default' for sigma and L as there is no evidence yet to suggest lead time deviations.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a 3-pack of cotton lace thongs (Womens Lingerie). Historical data from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04 shows a mean demand of ~217 units/week, but a clear downward trend (from 267 down to 122). However, actual demand in Period 1 (159) and Period 2 (373) shows volatility and a significant spike in Period 2. This spike might be related to post-Valentine's Day restocks or late-February promotions. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 704 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order from P1 (361 units) is expected to arrive at the start of Period 5. mu_hat needs to cover the review period (1) + promised lead time (4) = 5 periods. Using the mean of recent samples (last 5 available: 298, 307, 189, 122, 159, 373) gives an average of ~241. To be conservative given the 0 stock and \ucd5c\uadfc spike, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent volatility. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the high variance observed (122 to 373).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). We are selling 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' (Womens Lingerie). Historical demand samples show a downward trend from late January into February (267, 298, 307 down to 189, 122). However, recent observed demand in the game periods (P1: 159, P2: 373, P3: 301) shows significant recovery/volatility, averaging ~278 units over the last three weeks. The promised lead time is 4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5, which we will see in the Period 6 start message). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 1109 in-transit (Orders from P1, P2, P3). Since demand is highly volatile (std dev of P1-P3 is high), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current demand level (avg ~278) while accounting for the high recent variance. I'll maintain the default lead time (4) as no evidence yet suggests a delay or loss (P1 order hasn't reached its promised arrival date yet).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is a 3-pack cotton thong, a staple item. Demand samples (267, 298, 307, 189, 122, 159, 373, 301, 278) show a mean of approximately 255. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have orders from Period 1 through Period 4 (totaling 1389 units) and are just now starting Period 5, we expect the first order (placed in Period 1) to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. This arrival will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and sales have been 0 because no stock has arrived yet. Demand is relatively stable but shows high variance (std ~ 78). I will set mu_hat based on the average of all 9 available demand data points (5 historical + 4 game history) to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). L is maintained at the default promised lead time of 4 until we see the first arrival confirmation.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs. Based on 'Period 5 conclude', the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (promised lead time), confirming L=4 is accurate so far. We currently have 111 units on-hand and 1028 in-transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Historical demand samples (including P1-P5) are: 267, 298, 307, 189, 122 (pre-game) and 159, 373, 301, 278, 250 (in-game). The mean demand across all 10 samples is approximately 254.4. There is no clear shift in demand regime or seasonality yet (late February/early March is generally stable for basic underwear). Since L=4 is confirmed, the OR engine needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using 'default' for mu_hat will use the all-sample average (~254.4 * 5 = 1272), which aligns well with current needs given the high in-transit balance. We will maintain default parameters as both lead time and demand appear stable around the promised/historical averages.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/3/25 (Period 7). The SKU is cotton thongs. Promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms observed lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6). Current on-hand is 238, with 818 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P6). Historical demand samples (last 5 available in prompt + 6 game periods) show a mean around 245. Specifically, game demand has been: 159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216. The high initial variance (373 down to 216) suggests a slight downward trend or stabilization after an initial peak. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=5 for demand better captures the current range (ending with 216) compared to the full history including pre-game samples. Pipeline inventory (818) + On-hand (238) = 1056 units total, which covers roughly 4.3 periods of demand at ~245/week. The OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to maintain the service level while managing holding costs, which are equal to profit ($1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 and P2 orders both arrived with 4-period delay).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is cotton-jersey thong briefs, a staple item with relatively stable demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical 'conclude' messages for Periods 1, 2, and 3 have all confirmed an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 390 units, with 775 units currently in-transit (orders from P4, P6, and P7). Demand has stabilized since an initial spike in Period 2. The mean demand over the last 5 weeks (periods 3 to 7) is approximately 259.6 units per week. Given the stability, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time, I will continue to use the default promised lead time as it matches actual observations.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a women's cotton thong (lingerie), which typically shows stable demand but can be influenced by spring seasonality. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has fluctuated between 122 and 373. Recent in-game demand (Periods 5-8) has stabilized around an average of 250 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (validated in the last four consecutive arrival events). Current on-hand inventory is 387 units, and the pipeline contains 628 units (orders from P6-P8). Using N=4 for mu_hat captures the stable post-delivery demand regime (avg ~250 units/week). For sigma_hat, using recent_N=8 captures the volatility of both the high initial demand and the more recent stable period, ensuring a safe buffer for a product with high holding costs relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's floral/lace thong, and historical demand has been relatively stable, averaging ~243 units per week over the last 9 periods (P1-P9). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data from P5 through P8 confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). In Period 9, 'arrived=0' is expected because no order was placed in Period 5. The total pipeline includes orders from P6 (133), P7 (362), P8 (133), and P9 (238), totaling 866 units. With on-hand inventory at 211, the total coverage is ~1077 units. Given the lead time (L=4) plus current period (L+1=5), and an average demand of ~243, we need to cover approximately 1215 units. Since 1077 < 1215, a replenishment order is appropriate. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as the history is stable at the promised 4 periods, and 'recent_N' with N=9 for demand to capture the post-initial-history behavior while smoothing variations.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for 'Greta Thong Mynta' (cotton jersey underwear) has shown a recent decrease. The most recent demand samples are 176 and 169 (Periods 9 and 10), significantly lower than the average from Periods 3-8 (approx 260). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 (Period 5 order was 0, so no arrival expected in Period 9). We are in a lower demand regime, so I will use recent_N=5 to capture this shift. The pipeline is full (928 units in-transit). L is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 9: Average weekly demand dropped from ~260 to ~173 (-33%).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical data and recent game history show a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 9 (April 8). The initial demand averaged ~260-280 units, but the last three periods (P9, P10, P11) have consistently shown lower demand (176, 169, 176 respectively), averaging roughly 174 units. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, and P11 all show a 4-period lag). Note that Period 9's arrival (ordered Period 5) is missing, but since 0 units were ordered in Period 5, 'arrived=0' is expected. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower-demand regime. This will adjust the base stock downward to prevent excess inventory, as current on-hand (361) and in-transit (566) are high relative to the new demand level.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '464297007' is a cotton thong. Current date is 2019-05-06. Looking at recent history, the demand showed a significant drop in Period 9-11 (averaging ~173), but spiked back up to 323 in Period 12. This spike suggests that the demand drop seen in April might have been a temporary dip or that we are entering a higher demand phase in May. However, the last 4 periods average is (176+169+176+323)/4 = 211. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12). For OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent. 2) mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent mean demand including the Period 12 spike while acknowledging the previous lower levels. This results in (1+4)*211 = 1055. 3) sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to reflect the increased volatility introduced by the Period 12 jump. The on-hand inventory (171) plus in-transit (433) equals 604, which is below the calculated base stock required to cover the (L+1) window, necessitating a restock.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Lead time is stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5-13). Demand analysis shows a significant shift starting in Period 9. Before Period 9, the average demand was approximately 260. Between Period 9 and Period 13 (5 samples), the average dropped to ~193. While Period 12 saw a spike (323), Period 13 dropped back significantly (122), suggesting the spike was an outlier or a temporary variation rather than a return to previous levels. To avoid over-ordering and high holding costs (Profit=1, Holding=1 suggests a 50% target service level), I will use the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting this lower demand regime. Lead time L is set to default (4).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/20. The item is a 3-pack of cotton thong briefs, a stable lingerie staple. Lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods based on history (P10 arrived in P14). Demand experienced a regime shift around P9, moving from ~260 to ~173 per week. However, P12 showed a spike (323), while P13-P14 returned to lower levels (122, 151). The average demand of the last 6 periods (P9-P14) is approx 185, but excluding the P12 spike, the mean is ~158. Given equal profit and holding costs ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. On-hand (331) + In-transit (484) = total pipeline of 815. 815 units covers about 4.4 periods of demand at the old rate (185) or 5.1 periods at the new rate (160). Since we are currently in a lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the regime shift while acknowledging the P12 variance. I will use L=4 and default sigma to maintain safety stock against those occasional spikes.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-27. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by sequential arrivals (P1-P4, P6-P10). Note: Period 5 had zero order placed, hence the zero arrival in Period 15, which matches expectations. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 9; since then, demand has averaged ~180 units/week, with an outlier increase in P12 (323). The last three periods (P13-P15) show demand of 122, 151, and 171 respectively. Given that L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand (160) + in-transit (600) = 760 units. Based on a 5-period average (P11-P15: ~188 units/period), 5 periods of demand equals ~940 units. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the post-regime-shift mean while smoothing the P12 outlier, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Total in-transit is 760 units, comprised of orders from Period 13 (334), Period 14 (150), Period 15 (116), and Period 16 (160). The Period 13 order (334 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 17 (lead time = 4), meaning visible inventory will improve next period. I am currently out of stock (on-hand = 0) because the orders from Period 11 and 12 were both 0, leading to a gap in the delivery pipeline. Since Period 9, demand has stabilized into a lower regime. The average demand from P9 to P16 is approximately 186.25 units per week (excluding the stockout-limited Period 16, it is 184.2 units). I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this stable post-shift demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 17 where the P13 order arrived). Demand is in a stable lower regime established since Period 9. However, the system experienced stockouts in Period 16 due to skipped/delayed deliveries from Periods 11 and 12 (ordered 0 units). Recent demand (P9-P17) averages 182 units per week. To calculate mu_hat, I use the last 9 samples (since the regime shift at P9) to forecast for the (L+1) window, which is 5 weeks. 182 * 5 = 910. For sigma_hat, I use the standard deviation of those same 9 samples (approx 58) across the lead time window: 58 * sqrt(5) \u2248 130. These parameters will allow the OR backend to replenish inventory up to a level that accounts for the current demand rate while managing the high holding cost ($1/unit).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/17. Demand analysis shows a sustained regime since Period 9 with an average of approximately 173 units per period, though Period 18 saw a spike to 281. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 17 and 18). However, there were significant gaps in arrivals during Periods 15 and 16 (where orders from Periods 11 and 12 were expected but never arrived, confirming they were likely lost as they are now 7-8 periods past order date). On-hand inventory is low (49 units) and pipeline inventory is 583. Given demand can spike (as seen in P18), I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, while acknowledging the recent volatility. Setting L to 4 matches the observed stability of surviving shipments.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 11 and 12 (expected P15 and P16) are confirmed lost after 7+ periods of no arrival; inventory strategy now accounts for gaps in the supply chain.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (late June), we face a stockout after a demand spike of 556 in Period 19. Historical patterns suggest a demand drop-off after such spikes, though the current 'Womens Lingerie' category may see summer-related volatility. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in Period 17, 18, and 19 deliveries). Inventory is currently zero on-hand with 762 in transit. Specifically, orders from P16 (160 units), P17 (170 units), P18 (137 units), and P19 (295 units) are pending. These are expected to arrive in Periods 20, 21, 22, and 23 respectively. Because of the lost shipments from P11 and P12, I am maintaining 'explicit' methods to ensure the mu_hat and sigma_hat are responsive to the recent regime shift (Avg ~173 since P9) but padded for the recent volatility (P19 spike). I will set mu_hat based on the 11-period mean since the drop in Period 9 (approx 222 units including the spike) scaled over L+1 periods. Sigma_hat is set to capture the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand spike of 556 in P19 (Date: 2019/6/17) resulted in an immediate stockout. Pipeline inventory is healthy (762 units) but pending arrivals must be monitored to ensure no further losses occur.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Underwear) is currently in a high-demand phase following a significant spike in Period 19 (demand=556). While Period 20 demand (261) returned closer to previous levels, it still sits above the Spring average of ~170. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) and awaiting arrivals. Historical analysis confirms a reliable 4-period lead time for successful shipments, although Period 11 and 12 orders were previously lost. The Period 17 order (170 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 21. Given the stockout and the recent volatility, I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for (1+L) = 5 periods of demand based on a conservative forecast of 300 units/week to ensure the pipeline-based ordering logic triggers sufficient replenishment to rebuild safety stock following the recent surge. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher standard deviation observed during this volatile June/July transition.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand elevation: Demand in Periods 18-20 (avg 366) is significantly higher than the Mar-May average (~180), likely reflecting seasonal shopping shifts.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a high-demand summer phase. Period 21 ended with 0 on-hand inventory due to a sustained surge (avg demand Periods 18-21 is ~325 units, compared to the spring average of ~170). Although 'In-transit' shows 1328 units, internal calculations and history (Carry-over Insight Period 19) confirm that orders from Periods 11 and 12 were lost. The relevant current pipeline consists of orders from Periods 18-21 (totaling 1328 units), with the P18 order (137 units) expected to arrive during the current Period 22 execution phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. To capture the summer demand shift while maintaining a high service level amidst zero current stock, I am using a recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to focus specifically on the high-demand regime since Period 18.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: Periods 18-21 average demand is 324.75 units (+87% vs previous spring baseline).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal demand regime for this lingerie product (Greta Thong) has stabilized at a higher level than the spring baseline. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is approximately 328 units. We are currently experiencing stockouts (zero on-hand inventory) despite arrivals because the demand spikes since mid-June have outpaced historical safety levels. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a significant pipeline (1487 units), we need to ensure our base stock (mu_hat + safety stock) reflects the new summer regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean of ~328 and the high volatility (sigma) observed during the June 17th spike (556 units). This will help the OR backend calculate a target stock level that bridges the gap until the large pipeline orders from P20 and P21 arrive.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a sustained high-demand summer regime. Since Period 18, weekly demand has averaged 343.7 units, significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~180. The inventory position is critical: on-hand inventory has been 0 for five of the last six periods, resulting in substantial lost sales. Although a delivery of 295 units arrived in Period 23, it was immediately exhausted by Period 23's demand (422), leaving us at 0 on-hand for the start of Period 24. A large pipeline of 1345 units is in transit, including orders from P20 (338 units) and P21 (558 units) expected to arrive in Periods 24 and 25 respectively. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. To recover service levels and prevent further stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (matching the start of the summer spike) to capture the current average of ~340 units/week. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 120 per week (approx 270 over L+1) to account for the high volatility seen in P19 (556) and P23 (422).

Carry-over insight: Summer high-demand regime sustained (P18-P23): Average weekly demand is 343.7 units, representing a persistent shift from the previous regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25 (2019/07/29), we see the inventory stabilized with an ending on-hand of 203. The 'summer high-demand regime' identified in previous carry-overs (P18-P23) showed an average demand of ~343.7 units. However, Period 24 demand dropped significantly to 135 units. Looking at the broader summer context (P18-P24), the mean is 313.8. There is a risk that the summer peak is subsiding as we move towards August. To balance the risk of holding costs (which are high at $1.0/unit) against lost sales, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the entirety of the elevated summer period while reflecting the recent cool-down. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to handle the extreme volatility seen in mid-June (demand range 135 to 556). Lead time is stable at 4 periods according to recent 'conclude' messages (P20-P24).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand volatility: Late June peak (556) followed by late July drop (135). Regime P18-P24 average is 313.8, but high variance suggests monitoring for a seasonal transition in August.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high-demand regime (P18-P25) has seen an average demand of 291 units, despite a recent softening in late July (P24: 135, P25: 133). The product is a lingerie item (thong briefs), which typically experiences steady demand with seasonal peaks. We are currently in early August; while demand has dipped from the June peak (556), it remains significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~170. We have 628 units on hand and 823 in the pipeline (ordered P22-P24). Since lead time is consistently 4 weeks, the next arrivals are due in P26 (from P22), P27 (from P23), and P28 (from P24). The inventory position is currently high (1451 total), but we must maintain coverage for the L+1 period window. Period 11 and 12 shipments were confirmed lost previously, so we rely on 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the 4-period stability of successful arrivals. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the elevated summer regime while allowing the recent lower samples at the end of July to temper the forecast slightly. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to reflect the high volatility (range 133 to 556) seen in this period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand summer regime that started around P18. Current date is mid-August (2019-08-12). While there was a significant demand spike in June (556) and a subsequent drop in late July (133, 135), the most recent demand (P26) returned to 339, confirming the elevated summer baseline. On-hand inventory is healthy (585) thanks to large arrivals from orders placed during the stockout period (P21, P22). In-transit inventory (533) includes orders from P23 (153), P24 (374), and P26 (6). With the promised lead time of 4 periods consistently holding (confirmed by latest arrivals), the pipeline is sufficient but needs to be managed to avoid overstocking as we exit the peak summer season. I will use a recent_N approach (N=9, covering P18-P26) to capture the current high-demand regime mean and volatility while avoiding the influence of the lower spring baseline.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P18-P26) average confirmed at ~296 units per week, with significant volatility (std dev ~140). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand summer regime that started around Period 18. For the last 10 periods (P18-P27), the average demand is 287.2 units. Although demand has fluctuated (ranging from 133 to 556), the most recent demand in P27 was 243. We are currently in mid-August (Date: 2019/8/19), a period where summer demand typically begins to stabilize before potential autumn shifts. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods since the disruptions in P11-P12. On-hand inventory is healthy at 495, and 'in-transit' is 745. My strategy is to set parameters based on the recent high-demand regime (last 10 periods) to ensure we maintain service levels during this volatile period, using N=10 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the 'Summer' behavior while smoothing out the extreme P19 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-669.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), we are transitioning out of the high summer demand peak. Demand over the last five weeks (P24-P28) has cooled significantly, averaging 190 units compared to the June-July peak. Specifically, the last two weeks saw a demand of 243 and 100, indicating a downward regime shift as the summer season ends. Current on-hand inventory is 769 units, and in-transit inventory is 587 units (from orders in P26, P27, P28). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and cooling demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recent deceleration and avoid overstocking. Sigma_hat is also set using N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility seen in late August. L is kept at 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling: Average demand from P24-P28 dropped to 190 units, compared to the P18-P23 summer average of ~344 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Greta Thong' (Womens Lingerie) has transitioned from a summer high-demand phase (P18-P23 avg: ~344) to a cooler post-summer regime. Since Period 24, demand has slowed significantly, with the last 6 periods (P24-P29) averaging 179 units. The current date is 2019-09-02, entering autumn, which confirms the end of the summer spike. On-hand inventory is high (645 units) and there is a substantial pipeline (587 units), leading to a total coverage of 1,232 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. My strategy is to reduce mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to match the new lower demand baseline (avg ~179) and prevent over-ordering, while maintaining sufficient safety stock via sigma_hat to account for residual volatility. Given the current inventory levels and the lower demand forecast, the OR backend will likely minimize new orders to bleed off excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed post-summer demand cooling (P24-P29): Demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~179 units per week, down from the summer peak of ~344.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-09. We are in a confirmed 'post-summer demand cooling' regime that began around P24. The average demand from P24 to P30 is approximately 156 units (135, 133, 339, 243, 100, 124, 101), but the last three periods specifically show a stabilization toward much lower figures (avg 108). To avoid overstocking while holding 550 units on-hand and 581 in-transit, I am transitioning the demand forecast to a shorter window (recent_N=7) to capture this cooling trend. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently high relative to this new lower demand (covering ~5 periods), so the OR backend will naturally reduce order sizes to optimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime (P24-P30) confirmed: Mean weekly demand for the period is ~156 units, with the most recent three weeks (P28-P30) averaging ~108 units, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~344.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) has entered a significantly cooler regime following the summer peak. Comparing the most recent 8 weeks (P24-P31) to the mid-summer peak shows a clear drop. Specifically, the last 4 weeks (P28-P31) had an average demand of 100.5 units, compared to the summer high (P18-P23) which averaged ~344 units. Current on-hand inventory is 838 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (~8 weeks of supply on hand), plus 216 units in-transit. To avoid excessive holding costs, I am reducing mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the post-summer cooling while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime established (P24-P31): Mean weekly demand has dropped to ~155 units; the most recent 4 weeks (P28-P31) average ~100 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The system has clearly transitioned from the high-demand summer regime (P18-P23 avg: ~344) to a cooler post-summer/autumn regime. Demand over the last 9 periods (P24-P32) has averaged 156.4 units, but the most recent 5 weeks (P28-P32) show a further stabilization around 119 units. The last four demand points are 100, 124, 101, 77, and 194. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 860 units with zero in-transit, which is more than enough to cover the next 5 periods of demand (L+1) at current rates. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand over the risk period. Current inventory significantly exceeds this, so no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent cooling trend using the last 9 periods since the summer peak ended to provide a stable but realistic forecast for the backend.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P24-P32) confirmed: Mean weekly demand for this cooling period is 156.4 units. The most recent 5 weeks (P28-P32) average 119.2 units, indicating a return to early spring levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $524.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we observed a massive demand spike of 692 units (Date: 2019/09/23). While the preceding 5 weeks (P28-P32) suggested a cooling trend with an average of ~119 units, this new spike suggests a possible late-September/early-October seasonal event or promotion. On-hand inventory has dropped to 168 units, and there is currently 0 in-transit inventory (all previous orders up to P28 have arrived or were confirmed lost). To prevent a stockout during this unexpected resurgence in demand while acknowledging the high volatility, I am setting mu_hat using a shorter window (recent_N=6) to capture the cooling period plus the recent spike. I am also using an explicit sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility (std dev of P28-P33 is ~235) to ensure the OR backend increases the base stock sufficiently to cover potential further spikes.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 33 (692 units) after a 5-week cooling period (avg ~119). Pipeline is empty as of Period 34; new orders are required to prevent stockouts if this demand level persists.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 and 34, we observed a massive and sudden demand spike (692 and 335 units). This represents a distinct departure from the 'post-summer cooling' regime (avg ~119) and likely signals a new seasonal peak or promotional event. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units). While a large order of 601 units was placed in Period 34, it won't arrive until Period 38 (given the stable 4-period lead time). With an empty pipeline and exhausted on-hand stock, immediate aggressive ordering is necessary. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1750, which covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at a forecast of 350 units/week (averaging the recent spike). I am also setting sigma_hat explicitly to 400 to reflect the sudden increase in volatility and to ensure the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to buffer against further spikes.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected starting Period 33: Significant spike (692 and 335 units) ending the post-summer cooling phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the SKU is in a state of stockout with 0 on-hand inventory following a significant demand surge in Periods 33-34 (totaling 1,027 units). Although demand cooled to 123 units in Period 35, the pipeline is critical. Orders were placed in Period 34 (601) and Period 35 (645), which are expected to arrive in Period 38 and 39 respectively, given the stable 4-period lead time. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 1,246 reflects these recent large orders. Since there are no arrivals due until Period 38, we remain at risk of stockouts if demand stays elevated. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime (average demand ~383 over P33-P35), ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for both the massive spike and the subsequent cooling while replenishing the depleted pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand volatility persists post-spike; P33-P35 average demand is 383.3 units. No arrivals expected until Period 38 (from P34 order). Pipeline of 1,246 units is sufficient if lead time holds.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a state of stockout with 0 on-hand inventory, following a significant demand spike in P33 and P34 (692 and 335 units). Demand has since stabilized back to lower levels (P35: 123, P36: 100). The pipeline is robust at 1,917 units from large orders placed in P34, P35, and P36. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the first major replenishment (P34 order of 601 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P37) and becomes visible in the next period's report. To determine the parameters, I am using a recent regime of 5 periods (P32-P36) which captures the spike and the subsequent cooling. This provides a mean weekly demand of 290.8 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent volatility while the pipeline catches up to satisfy the backlogged demand and future requirements.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike stabilization (P33-P36): After a massive spike in P33 (692), demand has retreated in P35-P36 (avg 111.5). The surge appears isolated or related to specific promotion/event rather than a sustained shift to a 600+ regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) following a demand spike in Period 33 (692 units) and Period 34 (335 units). Since Period 35, demand has stabilized at a lower level (avg ~115 units), but no arrivals have occurred to replenish stock. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the first major replenishment (ordered Period 34, 601 units) is expected to arrive in Period 38 (the current period). Following this, large orders of 645 units (P35) and 671 units (P36) are in-transit, totaling 1,917 units. Given the recent demand stabilization back to ~115-125 units, the pipeline is now heavily over-supplied. My strategy is to set lead time to 'calculate' (stable at 4) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (P33-P37) to capture both the spike and the subsequent cooling. This will result in no new orders this period while the system absorbs the massive incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization post-spike: After the Period 33 surge (692 units), demand for P35-P37 has averaged 115.7 units, suggesting the spike was a non-sustained event.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand spike in Period 33 (692 units) was a non-sustained event. Since then, demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P35-P38) to an average of 115.5 units, which is consistent with the early spring and post-summer cooling baselines. On-hand inventory is currently 486 units following the arrival of the Period 34 order. There is a very large pipeline of 1,316 units (from P35 and P36 orders) expected to arrive over the next two periods (P39 and P40). Given that lead time remains stable at 4 periods and the current inventory plus pipeline far exceeds the anticipated demand of ~115 units per week, no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this stabilized post-spike demand and setting L to calculate to maintain the confirmed 4-period lead time logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-649.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 464297007 shows a significant but short-lived spike in Periods 33-34 (692 and 335 units), followed by a return to moderate demand (Avg P35-P39: 140.6 units). The massive spike in Period 33 appears to be an outlier or event-driven, as demand has since stabilized near the spring/fall baseline of ~150-180 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (890 units) due to the arrival of orders from Periods 34 and 35. With 671 units still in-transit from Period 36 (expected to arrive in Period 40), the current pipeline is very healthy. I will use a recent_N method (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current stabilization trend (P33-P39) which averages ~247 units, ensuring we don't over-react to the single 692-unit outlier while acknowledging the slightly higher mean compared to the pre-spike cooling phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization post-spike confirmed: Following the P33 surge (692), demand for P35-P39 has averaged 140.6 units, indicating the extreme spike was not a permanent regime shift.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are moving into the late holiday shopping season. Recent demand in P39-P40 has shown an increase (241 and 387 units) compared to the post-spike baseline (avg ~140 in P35-P39), likely indicating a seasonal uptick for the 'Womens Lingerie' category. On-hand inventory is high at 1,174 units following the arrival of large orders placed during the Period 33-34 stockout crisis. Pipeline inventory is currently zero. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' as it has consistently remained at 4 periods. For demand, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 (Periods 35-40) to capture the recent stabilization and the start of the November uptick, resulting in a mean of approximately 181 units. This allows the high on-hand stock to be utilized while maintaining a base stock level that accounts for the observed seasonal growth without over-ordering and incurring excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand uptick detected: Demand in P39-P40 (avg 314) significantly exceeds the P35-P38 stabilization mean (~113), likely reflecting pre-holiday shopping for lingerie.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are seeing a sustained seasonal uptick in demand, likely related to the pre-holiday shopping period for lingerie. Demand for the last three periods (P39-P41) has been 241, 387, and 348 respectively, averaging ~325 units. This is a significant shift from the previous post-spike stabilization mean of ~140. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 826 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, existing stock covers approximately 2.5 periods of the current demand level. The OR backend will calculate a base stock target and place an order to cover the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), which at ~325 units/week is ~1625 units. This will trigger an order to replenish pipeline safety stock for the December holiday peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed starting Period 39: Mean demand increased from ~140 to ~325 (+130%) coinciding with late November/pre-December seasonality.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). Analyzing the demand history, a clear holiday regime shift occurred around Period 39 (Late Nov), with demand in the last 4 weeks (P39-P42) being 241, 387, 348, and 311 (average ~322). This aligns with the seasonal lingerie demand identified in earlier carry-overs. Current on-hand is 515 and pipeline is 450 (from P42), totaling 965. Given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 43 plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). At an average of 322 units, requirement is ~1610 units. Our current inventory position (965) is significantly below this. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this holiday regime specifically. For sigma_hat, I'll also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the current volatility in this holiday period. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a holiday demand regime (starting Period 39) with a mean weekly demand of approximately 310 units (P39-P43 average is 310.6). The current date is Dec 9, 2019, which is peak seasonality for lingerie items. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My base stock needs to cover L+1 (5 weeks) of demand at this higher rate. On-hand inventory is 249, and in-transit is 874 (from orders in P42 and P43), totaling 1,123 units. To maintain safety against holiday volatility and ensure availability for the next 4-5 weeks, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 weeks (N=5) to capture the sustained 300+ demand level, while keeping sigma_hat defensive to handle potential spikes similar to those seen earlier in the year.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday shopping period (2019/12/16). Demand has been elevated since Period 39, with an average of approximately 330 units per week (P39-P44: 241, 387, 348, 311, 266, 380). The most recent demand (P44) was 380 units, leading to a stockout (on-hand is 0). Although in-transit inventory is high (1283 units), these orders (placed in P42, P43, P44) are not expected to arrive until P46, P47, and P48 respectively, given the confirmed 4-period lead time. This creates a critical supply gap for Period 45. To bridge this gap and optimize for the remaining two periods of the game (total 47), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high-demand holiday regime (~322 units/week). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' at 4 periods as it has proven stable.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the holiday shopping season (late December). Starting in Period 39 (early November), we observed a demand regime shift to approximately 325 units per week. The most recent demand (P40-P45) has averaged 342 units, confirming this higher level. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), but pipeline inventory is robust at 1,611 units. Our Period 42 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 46 (as confirmed by the stable 4-period lead time). With 1 period remaining after this one, we must continue ordering to cover late-season demand and ensure adequate safety stock against the observed volatility (std dev ~48). Setting mu_hat to a recent 7-period average (capturing the holiday shift) and sigma_hat to the same period provides the necessary service level for the $1 profit/holding profile.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed (P39-P45): Mean weekly demand is ~340 units, a sustained increase from the autumn baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the holiday demand regime for lingerie (late December). Historical demand from Period 39 to 46 shows a sustained mean of approximately 340 units per week. Although Period 46 concluded with 92 units on-hand, we have a significant pipeline of 1,188 units. Following the promised lead time of 4 periods (which has been highly stable recently), orders from Period 43, 44, and 45 are expected to arrive in Periods 47, 48, and 49 respectively. Given the date (Dec 30), we expect holiday demand to sustain for another 1-2 periods before potentially cooling in mid-January. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current 340-unit regime, and sigma_hat with a similar window to account for holiday volatility. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the 4-period promise.
