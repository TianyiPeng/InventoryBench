Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Tilly', a women's jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 0, 0, 24, 58, 84. This indicates a seasonal ramp-up or a recently launched product gaining traction. Given the 'Womens Everyday Basics' category and the timing (approaching Spring), I expect demand to continue growing or at least stabilize at the higher recent levels. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to order immediately to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand to capture the recent growth (mean of 24, 58, 84 is 55.33), rather than the 'default' which would include the initial zeros. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the current demand regime. Lead time is set to 'default' as we have no historical arrivals yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a basic T-shirt. Looking at the history (including the seed data), demand has been ramping up significantly: 0, 0, 24, 58, 84, and finally 129 in Period 1. This suggests a strong upward trend as we move into the spring season. The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 105 units in transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 4, these units won't arrive until Period 5. To prevent further stockouts and account for the clear growth, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (average of 58, 84, 129 is ~90) to capture the recent high-growth regime. This will adjust mu_hat to approximately (1+4)*90 = 450. I will keep Lead Time at 'default' (4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest it differs from the promised value.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The item is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Demand has surged from the Jan base (avg ~33) to 129 in P1 and 268 in P2, likely due to spring season ramp-up and 'Everyday Basics' high demand periods. On-hand is currently 0, with 255 units in-transit (P1: 105, P2: 150). Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible P6). Because the profit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, z* = 0). I will use explicit forecasting to capture the rapid demand growth. The last three data points (Feb 4: 84, P1: 129, P2: 268) suggest a steep upward trend. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~300 per period over the 5-period horizon (L+1). L is set to default (4).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 666 units in-transit. We have experienced three periods of lost sales (demand: 129, 268, 233) because no stock has arrived yet. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect the first arrival in Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start message). Historical demand data shows a significant ramp-up from 0 in January to an average of ~210 units/week in February. For Period 4 (March 4th), we anticipate demand to stay high or increase slightly as spring approaches. I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the February demand regime (averaging ~210). Setting L=4 (default) as we have no evidence yet to contradict the promised lead time. Mu_hat will be based on the recent 3 samples to reflect the current high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected from Jan (0) to Feb (~210 avg). First arrival expected Period 5.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a women's basic T-shirt. Historical demand was zero in early January but surged in February (averaging ~201 units/period over the last 4 periods). Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (105 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 5 resolution phase, but since the system concludes the period after my decision, I still see 0 on-hand. In-transit inventory (995 units) covers the next several periods of expected demand. Because the demand regime shifted dramatically from the pre-game zeros to the Feb levels, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current active demand level (average 201) and volatility. Setting L to default (4) as we have no completed arrivals yet to suggest a drift.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Historical data since mid-January and throughout February/March shows a demand mean of approximately 165 units per week (Period 1-5 mean: 192.8, but following the '0' demand weeks of January, the February-March mean is closer to 190). Note: Demand in early January was 0, but since late January (2019-01-21), we see sustained demand. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P1-P5) had demands of 129, 268, 233, 174, and 160. Average demand of these 5 periods is 192.8. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). We are currently out of stock (ending OH=0 in P5) because the P1 order of 105 units was smaller than P5's demand of 160. Total in-transit is 900 (Orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=5 captures the active demand regime accurately while excluding the initial zero-demand phase. mu_hat needs to cover 5 periods of ~193 units (~965 total). Since in-transit is 900, the OR backend will order approximately 65 units to bridge the gap and maintain the buffer.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Active demand regime (Feb-Mar) mean is ~193 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Demand has stabilized into a high-season regime following the zero-demand period in January. The last 6 periods (Feb-Mar) show a mean demand of 195 units/period (129, 268, 233, 174, 160, 207). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because arrivals (105 in P5, 150 in P6) were insufficient to meet demand (160 and 207). There is a large pipeline (814 units) from orders placed in P3 (411), P4 (329), P5 (10), and P6 (64). The P3 order (411 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 7. To maintain stability, I will use a 6-period window (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the active spring demand regime, and set L based on the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a staple item as we enter April (Spring season). Demand has stabilized since the initial zero-demand period in January. Looking at the last 6 periods (Period 2 to Period 7), the demand mean is approximately 210.5 units (268, 233, 174, 160, 207, 221). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Currently, we have 190 units on-hand and 565 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). The next arrival (P4 order) is expected during Period 8 (visible in P9). Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand average of ~210 units per period over the 5-period window to ensure we maintain enough stock for Spring demand without incurring excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime (Feb-Mar) stabilized with a mean of ~211 units/period; Lead time consistent at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demand since the start of February (Period 1) shows a stable regime with a mean of approximately 205 units/period (129, 268, 233, 174, 160, 207, 221, 245). The lead time is confirmed to be exactly 4 periods based on the last four arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). On-hand inventory is 274, and in-transit is 512, totaling 786 units of pipeline inventory. This covers approximately 3.8 periods of demand. Given the lead time is 4, we need to order to cover about (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full active demand regime since Feb 11, and set L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now consistently established in the history.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-April, which is the heart of the spring season for a 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt. Demand has shown a clear regime shift since February, with a mean demand of approximately 213 units per period (N=7, Periods 3\u20139). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as originally promised (confirmed by arrivals in P5\u2013P9). Currently, we have 97 units on-hand and 740 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, the OR engine needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N for both demand and sigma will capture the current spring regime more accurately than the full history, which includes early-year zeros. I will set N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include the data from the stabilized spring period (starting from Period 3).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics), which is heading into its peak seasonal period (late spring/summer). Since Period 2, the demand has been consistently high, fluctuating between 160 and 268 units. The most recent demand (Period 10) was 252 units, and the average since the regime shift in Period 2 (9 samples) is approximately 217 units/period. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been perfectly consistent across all 6 observed arrivals (Periods 5-10). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to 161 units sold against 252 demand, indicating a stockout. However, the in-transit pipeline (859 units) includes the Period 7 order (162 units) arriving this period (Period 11) and the Period 8 order (276 units) arriving next period. Using N=9 for demand stats covers the entire active high-demand regime since Feb 18th (Period 2), which is more representative than the zero-demand Jan period. This will set a base stock level targeting approximately 1,085 units ((1+4) * 217) plus safety stock, which is appropriate for the current sell-through rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (since Period 2) remains stable with a mean of ~217 units/period; Lead time remains perfectly stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a basic jersey T-shirt, which typically has high, stable demand through spring. Since the demand regime shift in early February, the mean weekly demand has been approximately 211 units (averaging Periods 1-11). The last two periods (P10 and P11) saw slightly higher demand (~252 units), resulting in stockouts because recent arrivals (64 and 162 units) were based on parameters set during a period of lower immediate pipeline need or smaller historical samples. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a significant in-transit pipeline (920), I need to ensure the base stock levels account for both the 4-period lead time and the 1-period review cycle (L+1=5). I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the post-January regime (Period 2 onwards) which averages ~217 units/period, providing a robust forecast that balances recent high demand with stabilized spring trends.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The SKU 610776033 (T-shirt in lightweight jersey) is entering the warmer spring/summer period. Historical demand since Period 2 (when the product became active) has been stable. Demand from Periods 2-12 averages 217.4 units/period, with the most recent three periods (P10-P12) showing slightly higher demand (250.3). Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (30), but a large delivery (from P9 order) is expected in Period 13's arrival phase. The OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. I am using recent_N=11 for mu_hat (covering the active demand regime since P2) and recent_N=11 for sigma_hat to capture the variance of this active period. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). Demand for the product ('Tilly' Jersey Basic T-shirt) has shown a stable pattern since Period 2. The mean demand from Period 2 to Period 13 is approximately 218 units/period. The most recent demand (Period 13) was slightly lower at 147, but remains within the expected seasonal range for a spring/summer basics item. Lead time is perfectly stable at 4 periods, with every order from Period 1 to 9 arriving exactly on schedule. On-hand inventory is 121, with 844 units in transit (scheduled arrivals for Periods 14, 15, 16, and 17). To maintain service levels given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (50% service level target), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full stable regime since Period 2, ensuring the OR backend uses a robust estimate of mu and sigma for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a staple for late spring and summer. Historical demand from Period 1 to 12 averaged ~217 units; however, the last two periods (P13 and P14) have seen a significant drop to 147 and 114 units respectively. This suggests either a mid-season lull or a shift in the demand regime as we move into late May. Given this recent downward trend, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the cooling demand (averaging ~190 over four periods) while remaining slightly conservative. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival history. The OR backend will use these to maintain a service level appropriate for the $1 profit/$1 holding cost balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening detected in May: average demand dropped from ~217 (P1-12) to ~130 (P13-14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. We are seeing a sustained decrease in demand for this jersey T-shirt (Women's Everyday Basics). Demand has dropped from a mean of ~217 (Periods 1-12) to approximately 133 units over the last three periods (P13: 147, P14: 114, P15: 138). This suggests a regime shift or seasonal cooling. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand environment. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical conclusions, so I am using the 'calculate' method. Despite the drop, the OR backend's capped policy will manage the high on-hand (275) and in-transit (554) inventory relative to the lower demand, likely resulting in a zero or small order to minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the current $1 profit/$1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 13: mean demand decreased from ~217 to ~133 (-39%), likely reflecting a post-peak seasonal adjustment for this item.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. This SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a lower demand regime since Period 13 (beginning of May), likely due to a post-peak seasonal transition. Demand over the last 4 periods (P13-P16) has been: 147, 114, 138, 125, resulting in a mean of 131 units/period. This is a significant drop from the previous average of ~217. Current on-hand inventory is 330 units, with 374 units in transit (expected arrivals from P13-P14 orders in the coming periods). Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering while maintaining at least a 50% service level.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. We are managing a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand was high in Spring (Feb-Apr, ~217 units/period) but shifted to a lower regime in May (starting P13, ~133 units/period). However, Period 17 saw a sharp spike back to 219 units, which may indicate a resurgence in early June or just high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 369, and in-transit is 116 (ordered P14), totaling 485 units of pipeline inventory. Since the demand from P13-P17 averages ~148 units (147, 114, 138, 125, 219), setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 captures the lower May average while reacting to the recent Period 17 spike. L is set to calculated as it has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Significant demand spike to 219 units observed, following 4 periods of lower May demand (~130). Monitoring if this is a sustained June rebound or volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776033' is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Demand history shows a high-volume period (Feb-Apr, ~217 units/period), a dip in May (P13-P16, ~131 units/period), and a sharp rebound in June (P17: 219, P18: 262). This rebound likely correlates with the start of summer. The mean of the last two periods is 240.5. Given the seasonality of t-shirts in mid-June, I expect this higher demand level to persist or slightly increase. I will use an explicit mu_hat based on a forecast of 245 units/period across the (L+1) window (4+1=5 periods) to ensure sufficient stock for this summer peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 6 periods to capture the recent high volatility between the May valley and June peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand rebound confirmed: June demand increased significantly from May lows (~131) to ~240 units (+83%). Forecasting sustained summer demand levels.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. This SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which is exhibiting a strong summer seasonal demand pattern. Recent history confirms a significant demand regime shift: from a May mean of ~131 units (P13-P16) to a June mean of 284 units (P17-P19: 219, 262, 371). The demand in P19 (371) is a significant peak, and we are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the product's high relevance to the current summer season and the increasing demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus exclusively on the summer rebound. This will increase the base stock calculation to cover the current high-demand trajectory. sigma_hat will also be based on the last 3 periods to account for the increased volatility seen in the summer peak.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776033' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a summer demand peak (June/July). Period 19 and 20 showed demand of 371 and 306 units respectively, confirming a significant upward shift from the May lows (~133) to a current regime mean of approximately 338.5 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which means the orders placed in Periods 15, 16, and 17 (all 0 units) have resulted in a stockout in Periods 19 and 20, as no arrivals occurred. In-transit inventory of 973 units covers the orders from P18 (217), P19 (343), and P20 (413). With current on-hand inventory at 0, we must maximize the target stock level to recover from the stockout and meet the sustained summer demand. I will use the last 2 samples (P19-P20) for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the current peak intensity (mean ~338.5) and set \u03c3\u0302 based on this recent high-volatility period to ensure high service levels during the peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Demand increased to ~338 units/period in late June (P19: 371, P20: 306), significantly higher than previous June estimates.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which is currently in its peak summer demand regime (July). Historical demand has significantly increased: the last three periods (P19-P21) show demand of 371, 306, and 320, averaging ~332 units/period. This is a dramatic shift from May's ~130 units. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals up to Period 18). Currently, there is an inventory stockout (on-hand = 0) with a significant pipeline in-transit (1377 units), but no arrivals have occurred in the last three periods (P19, P20, P21). Based on the lead time of 4, the order from Period 17 (0 units) would arrive in Period 21 (visible now), but the orders from Period 18 onwards (which were placed to meet the summer surge) will only start arriving from Period 22 through Period 25. Specifically, Period 18's order (217 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 22). Given the high summer demand and current stockout, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the summer peak for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the OR backend targets the (L+1) period demand of ~1660 units (5 * 332).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776033' is a summer staple (Womens Lightweight Jersey T-shirt). Current date is July 15, representing the peak summer demand season. Since Period 18, demand has entered a high-velocity summer regime with an average of approximately 298 units/period (P18-22 activity: 262, 371, 306, 320, 231). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P18 order in P22 (Lead Time = 22 - 18 = 4). However, there is a significant inventory gap in the 'conclude' history: orders from Periods 15, 16, and 17 were 0, leading to the stockouts observed in P19-21. The pipeline is currently recovering, but 'on-hand' is 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this higher summer demand intensity (approx 298 * 5 = 1490), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period (L+1=5). Explicit sigma_hat is set to account for the high variance observed during the June/July fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: High-summer demand regime (July) confirmed: mean demand approx 300 units/period (P18-P22). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. This SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which is in its high-summer demand phase. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than spring, with the last 5 periods (P19-P23) averaging 300 units/period (371, 306, 320, 231, 272). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in P22 (ordered P18) and P23 (ordered P19). Although there was a slight dip in demand over the last two weeks, the overall summer regime remains strong. I will use N=6 for mu_hat (covering the shift from June to July) to capture this recent high-demand level (~290 on average) while allowing for the slight cooling observed. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same N=6 to reflect the higher volatility seen in the summer months.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in the peak of the summer demand regime for this SKU (Womens lightweight jersey T-shirt). Demand remains high but has stabilized slightly from the late June peak, with the last three periods showing demand of 320, 231, 272, and 229, averaging approximately 263 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals from Period 18, 19, and 20. On-hand inventory is 255 with 985 units in transit (covering orders from P21-P24). My objective is to maintain a base stock level that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the last 7 periods (since the start of June/summer rebound) provides a robust average reflecting the current seasonal level (~280 units/period). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this sustained high-demand period while filtering out the lower May data.

Carry-over insight: Summer high-demand regime sustained into late July: Mean demand for P19-P24 is ~288 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). For this product (Womens Everyday T-shirt), historical demand shows a clear seasonal cycle: a spring peak (~215), a May dip (~130), a significant summer surge (peak ~370, average ~288 in July), and now a downward trend at the end of July (P24: 229, P25: 175). August typically sees a tapering off of high-summer apparel demand before any late-summer/back-to-school shifts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent drop from >300 to <200 units, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use the last 5 periods (P21-P25) to capture this cooling trend (mean ~259) rather than the previous high-summer peak. On-hand + In-transit (1248) comfortably covers expected demand for the lead time, so a moderate order is expected from the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: End of summer demand decline: Demand decreased from ~300 to ~200 units/period (P24: 229, P25: 175), indicating a seasonal transition from the high-summer peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are observing a post-summer demand decline for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand has dropped from a July average of ~300 units to approximately ~173 units over the last two periods (P25: 175, P26: 171). On-hand inventory is healthy at 598 units, and arrivals from the high-order period in July (P23-P25) are still in the pipeline. With lead time stable at 4 periods, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to quickly capture this downward shift and prevent overstocking as we enter late August. This results in a forecast of approximately (1+4) * 173 = 865 units for the protection interval. Given the current 1077 units (on-hand + in-transit), the OR backend will likely place a zero or minimal order, which is appropriate for a cooling demand phase with high holding costs ($1/unit).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline confirmed starting Period 25: mean demand decreased from ~300 to ~173 units (-42%) in August.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal transition: a high-summer peak (Periods 19-24, mean ~288) has dropped to a post-summer regime starting Period 25. The last three periods (P25-P27) have shown demand levels of 175, 171, and 158 respectively, establishing a new mean of approximately 168 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 485 units on-hand and 434 in-transit (reflecting orders from P24 and P25 arriving in P28 and P29), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this latest downward regime shift for mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal decline.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (August) confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~168 units/period (P25-P27), down from the ~288 units/period summer peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Womens T-shirt) is currently in a post-summer demand decline that began around Period 25. The high-summer peak of ~300 units/period (July) has shifted to an August regime averaging approximately 175 units/period (P25-P28 demand: 175, 171, 158, 194). Currently, on-hand inventory is 542 units, which is remarkably high given the lowered demand. With 183 units still in-transit (ordered P25), the pipeline is sufficient to cover the next 4 periods (L=4) at the current demand rate (~175 * 5 = 875 total needed vs 725 total currently available). I will set mu_hat to reflect the last 4 periods (recent_N = 4) to capture this lower late-August/early-September volume and avoid over-ordering, as the high holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0), making inventory bloat very expensive. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' message (Ordered P24, Arrived P28).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Analysis of recent demand (Period 25-29) shows a stable post-summer regime with a mean of approximately 175 units (175, 171, 158, 194, 178). This is a significant drop from the high-summer peak of ~288 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 547 and in-transit at 148, the total pipeline is 695 units. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current mean of 175, total required stock is approximately 875 units plus a safety buffer. However, the OR backend's capped policy will manage the order size relative to 695. To ensure the backend uses the most relevant recent data for this post-summer phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to use recent_N with N=5 (covering the stable August period).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (September start) appears stable at ~175 units/period based on P25-P29 data.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for this Jersey Basic T-shirt has stabilized into a post-summer regime. Following the high-summer peak in July (~300 units/period), demand dropped significantly in August and has stayed consistently lower. Observations from P25 to P30 show demand values of 175, 171, 158, 194, 178, and 117. While Period 30 was a bit lower (117), the overall average for this recent window (P25-P30) is approximately 165 units per period. The lead time remains extremely stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 430 and in-transit at 329, the pipeline is relatively healthy. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current late-summer/early-autumn demand level (approx 165/period), which will result in a mu_hat of roughly 825 (5 periods x 165). This allows the OR backend to maintain safety stock for the current regime while preventing excess accumulation as the season cools.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (late Aug/early Sept) confirmed: Mean demand has leveled at approximately 165 units/period (P25-P30), down from the summer peak of ~288.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as we move from summer into autumn. Demand has transitioned from a summer peak (~288 units/period) to a lower post-summer level. In the last two periods (P30-P31), demand has dropped further to 117 and 109 units (avg ~113), which is lower than the previous August/early Sept baseline of ~165. On-hand inventory is relatively high (321 units) and there is a significant pipeline (398 units) compared to the current cooling demand. No arrivals were recorded in P30 and P31 because no orders were placed in P26, P27, and P28 (respecting the 4-period lead time). The next arrival is expected in Period 33 (from the P29 order). I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the most recent 7 samples (P25-P31) to capture the August-September cooling trend, which averages approximately 150 units/period. The lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand trend: Demand has further deceased from the August baseline (~165) to an average of ~113 units/period in the last two weeks (P30-P31), confirming the end-of-season decline for lightweight jersey tops.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is experiencing a clear end-of-season demand decline. Historically, demand peaked in summer (~288 units/period) and significantly decreased through August (~165 units/period) and now September (~103 units/period over the last three weeks: 117, 109, 83). The most recent demand (P32) of 83 units confirms this downward trajectory as autumn approaches. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, although no arrivals were recorded in the last three 'conclude' messages (matching the zero-order periods P26-P28). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this immediate seasonal decline and avoid over-ordering during the off-season. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the lowered volatility at these lower volume levels. This strategy aims to minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season decline intensified in September: mean demand dropped to ~103 units/period (P30-P32) from the August average of ~165.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Women's Lightweight Jersey T-shirt) is in a clear end-of-season decline as we enter late September/early October. The demand regime has shifted from an August average of ~168 units to a September average of ~106 units (P30-P33). The most recent demand was 117. With on-hand inventory at 269 and in-transit at 319 (totaling 588 units), and demand trending downwards, the current pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) at the current rate (~530 units needed vs 588 available). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower late-September demand floor and avoid further overstocking as the season ends.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a clear end-of-season decline as we move into autumn. In the last five periods (P30-P34), demand has been 117, 109, 83, 117, and 68, averaging approximately 99 units per period. This is a significant drop from the August average of ~165. On-hand inventory is currently high (382 units), and there are still 138 units in transit (expected from orders in P31 and P32). Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 520 units, which covers more than 5 periods of demand at the current rate (~99 per period). Given the seasonal nature of the product, I expect demand to remain low or continue to decrease. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (last 5 periods) and keeping L at the confirmed 4 periods. The goal is to avoid accumulating excess holding costs while demand tapers off.

Carry-over insight: October demand shift: Mean demand for P30-P34 has dropped to ~99 units/period, marking a continued seasonal decline from September levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, mid-autumn. Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a clear seasonal decline. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) has dropped to approximately 86 units/period (109, 83, 117, 68, 49), with even lower values in the most recent two weeks (Avg: 58.5). Since on-hand inventory (402) plus remaining in-transit (69) totals 471 units, and the current consumption rate is low, there is more than enough stock to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current autumn demand level, and L to 'calculate' as lead time has been highly consistent at 4 periods. This configuration will naturally suppress ordering since existing inventory significantly exceeds the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand decline confirmed: Mean demand for P31-P35 is ~86 units/period, with the most recent two weeks (P34-P35) averaging below 60 units. Previous September averages were higher (~113).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-409.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a clear end-of-season decline as we enter late October. The mean demand has dropped significantly from the early September baseline (~113 per period) to an average of approximately 49 units per period over the last three weeks (P34: 68, P35: 49, P36: 31). On-hand inventory is currently high (440 units) following the arrival of orders placed during higher demand periods. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the current downward trend, the strategy is to halt ordering and let the existing inventory satisfy the remaining seasonal demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted using a recent_N of 5 to reflect the most recent autumn demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand decline accelerated in late October: mean demand for P34-P36 dropped to ~49 units/period, significantly lower than the September average of ~103.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776033' (T-shirt in lightweight jersey) is in a significant end-of-season decline as of late October. Demand has fallen from a September average of ~103 to a late-October average (P34-P37) of ~49 units/period. The most recent demand was 49, and the trend is clearly downward. On-hand inventory is currently 391 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we are effectively covered for the next 5 periods (L+1) even if demand remains at the current level (5 * 49 = 245 units required). Since current on-hand (391) exceeds this requirement and demand is expected to continue decreasing or remain low as we approach November, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this low-demand regime and allow the OR backend to avoid ordering more stock while liquidating current holdings. No new orders are needed.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter transition confirmed: October demand has stabilized at a low regime of ~49 units/period (P34-P37), down from ~100 in early September.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late autumn/winter season (November). Demand has significantly shifted to a low regime since early October. In the last 5 periods (P34-P38), demand has been 68, 49, 31, 49, and 27, averaging 44.8 units/period. The current in-stock position (364 units) is extremely high relative to this new demand regime. With a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At current rates, 5 periods of demand is ~224 units, while we have 364 on hand. No further orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this low-demand state and avoid triggering accidental orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: November demand transition: demand has stabilized at a low winter baseline of approximately 45 units/period (P34-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt remains in its late-autumn/winter low regime. Over the last six periods (P34-P39), demand has consistently averaged approximately 45 units/period (68, 49, 31, 49, 27, 26). The current on-hand inventory of 338 units is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time (L=4), meaning no new orders are necessary. The OR backend will see that the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) exceeds the calculated base stock for this low-demand regime. I will utilize the recent 6 periods to establish mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized low-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime confirmed (Nov): Average demand has stabilized at ~42 units/period (P34-P39) following the autumn decline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Women's Everyday Basics Lightweight T-shirt) is currently in a sustained low-demand winter regime. Analysis of the demand history from Period 35 to Period 40 shows a consistent, low level of activity: demand values have been [49, 31, 49, 27, 26, 25], averaging approximately 34.5 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 313 units, with no units in transit. Given the current average demand (~35 units) and a lead time of 4 periods, your total coverage requirement (on-hand + pipeline) for L+1 periods (5 periods) is approximately 175 units. Since the current on-hand inventory (313) significantly exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this stable winter baseline, which will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while maintaining a safe service level for the limited winter demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). Historical demand analysis confirms a sustained low-demand winter regime. From Period 34 onwards, demand has consistently declined from ~68 units to an average of ~38 units/period, with the most recent Period 41 reaching a low of 12 units. The 'Tilly' lightweight jersey t-shirt is essentially out of season. Current on-hand inventory is 301 units, which is significantly higher than the projected demand for the final 6 periods of the game (expected total demand < 200 units). There are no units in-transit. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $1.0, and the high inventory-to-demand ratio, the priority is to avoid ordering any additional units and instead deplete the existing stock to minimize holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect this winter baseline (approx 36 units/period), while the current inventory level will sufficiently cover the 4-period lead time plus the remaining game duration, ensuring zero new orders are triggered by the backend.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (Nov-Dec) confirmed: Mean demand has dropped significantly to approximately 36 units/period (P34-P41) as the product moves fully out of season.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a winter low-demand regime. Period 42 showed a demand spike to 64 units, but looking at the trend from P34-P42 (68, 49, 31, 49, 27, 26, 25, 12, 64), the average is approximately 39 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 237 units, which is more than enough to cover the remaining 5 periods of the simulation (43, 44, 45, 46, 47) at the current demand rate (~39 * 5 = 195 units). Since holding costs are equal to profit ($1.00), and there is zero in-transit inventory, I will set parameters to stop further ordering. I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the winter regime mean of ~39 units, but because on-hand (237) is significantly higher than the calculated base stock (approx 39 * 5 = 195), the capped policy will result in zero orders, which is optimal to minimize further holding costs for this seasonal item.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-111.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776033' (lightweight jersey t-shirt) is in a winter/end-of-season demand regime. Recent demand in late November and early December (Periods 42 and 43) showed a slight uptick to ~63 units/period, likely due to holiday promotions or seasonal clearance, up from the deep-winter lows of ~12-25 units seen in Periods 40-41. Current on-hand inventory is 174 units with 0 in-transit. With 4 periods remaining (P44-P47) and a stable lead time of 4, any order placed now would arrive in Period 48/49, which is past the end of the simulation. Therefore, the strategy is to satisfy the remaining demand from the existing stock to avoid further holding costs and maximize final profit. The current inventory (174) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (approx 63 units * 4 = 252 units is an overestimate given the product's basic/lightweight nature and the usual December drop-off, but even if demand persists at 60+, the system should not order more due to timing). I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 samples (P41-P43) which captures the minor late-year volume shift (avg ~46), effectively ensuring the OR engine doesn't trigger unnecessary orders for units that cannot arrive in time.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Late-season demand uptick observed in Dec (P42-43 avg ~63 units) compared to Nov lows (~25), likely clearance-driven. Simulation end (P47) approaches; lead time of 4 prevents new orders from arriving within the window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-150.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is near its end (Period 45 of 47). With a promised and historical lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) will arrive in Period 49 (45 + 4), which is beyond the simulation's conclusion in Period 47. Currently, on-hand inventory is 162 units, and there are 58 units in-transit (ordered P44, expected arrival P48). Recent demand has been low and volatile, averaging ~36 units in the winter regime until a recent December uptick (P42, P43). However, given that current on-hand inventory (162) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining two periods of demand (P45, P46) even at the highest recent demand levels (~64/period), and that new orders cannot arrive in time to be sold, the priority is to avoid additional holding costs. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent winter regime (last 10 periods) to reflect the low current demand, while the inherent base-stock calculation will naturally result in zero new orders because the pipeline (162 on-hand + 58 in-transit) already exceeds any realistic base stock for the final two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-148.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), and the simulation ends at Period 47. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would not arrive until Period 50, which is beyond the game's horizon. Current on-hand inventory is 155 units, which easily covers the recent low winter demand (averaging ~36 units/period, with a slight late-December fluctuation). There are also 58 units in-transit from Period 44 that will arrive in Period 48, also after the simulation ends. Since holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), maintaining excess inventory is detrimental to the total reward. Therefore, I will set order parameters to suppress any new ordering to maximize the final reward R_t.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-143.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 is the final decision period (Date: 2019/12/30). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now would arrive in Period 51, well beyond the simulation's end. Currently, there are 149 units on-hand and 58 units in-transit (ordered P44, expected arrival P48). Recent demand has dropped significantly as the product ('Tilly' lightweight jersey T-shirt) is deeply out of season, with demands of 12, 7, and 6 units in the last three weeks respectively. Given the 149 units on-hand far exceed any plausible demand for the remaining duration of the simulation, no further orders are required. The parameters are set to reflect this low-demand winter regime to prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary orders.

Carry-over insight: Final period reached. Product is in a deep winter low-demand regime (<10 units/period) as of late December. Existing inventory of 149 units is more than sufficient for the remainder of the simulation.
