Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for item 554772003 (Women's V-neck T-shirt). The current date is 2019/02/11. The historical demand data provided (5 samples) shows mean demand of approx 45.8 units/week (24, 44, 55, 64, 42). There's no clear evidence of a regime shift yet, though the late January peak (64) followed by a drop suggests some volatility. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no on-hand or in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock to cover demand over (L+1) periods (approx 5 weeks). Using L=4, mu_hat needs to account for 5 weeks of demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture all available history and 'default' for other parameters to establish the initial pipeline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's V-neck T-shirt, an everyday basic. Historical demand (P-5 to P0) was 24, 44, 55, 64, 42 (Mean: 45.8). Period 1 demand was 38. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (71 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 4. We cannot confirm actual lead time yet. Since demand appears relatively stable (mean ~44.5 over the last 6 weeks), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most relevant demand pattern. mu_hat will be (1+L) * mean. With L=4, mu_hat should cover 5 periods of demand (~222.5). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend uses the latest 6 samples (including P1 demand of 38) to set the base stock level.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU 554772-003 is a Women's V-neck T-shirt. Historical data from early Jan shows demand around 24-64, but recent periods (P1: 38, P2: 91) show a sharp upward trend as we move towards Spring/Summer seasonality. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments have arrived yet (Promised L=4). Orders were placed in P1 (71 units) and P2 (68 units), totaling 139 units in-transit. Demand in P2 spiked to 91, suggesting a significant increase in consumer interest. Since L=4, the P1 order is expected to arrive in P5 (visible in P6). To capture the recent demand surge while acknowledging the low sample size of the new regime, I will use recent_N=4 for demand forecasting (including recent P1, P2 and late Jan data) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the higher throughput needed to meet upcoming Spring demand and recover from stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased significantly in Period 2 (91 units) compared to the Jan average (approx 45 units), likely driven by Spring seasonality for basic T-shirts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (March 4). The item is a 'Women's Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. Historically, demand was stable around 45 units in January, but it surged to over 90 units starting in mid-February, signaling a seasonal shift into Spring. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 are still in-transit (Total: 238 units), which is expected as the first order (P1) is not due to arrive until P5. I have 0 units on-hand, leading to stockouts because the initial on-hand was 0 and lead time is long. To address the demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on the high-demand regime (91, 94, and current expectations). Since demand has doubled, I will also use 'recent_N' (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this new regime. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (4) as we have not yet observed any completed deliveries to suggest a deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 2-3 average demand is 92.5 units, double the Jan average of 45.8, matching Spring seasonality for basic jersey tops.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is a women's basic V-neck jersey top. Historical demand in January averaged 45.8, but since mid-February (Period 2), we've seen a shift consistent with Spring seasonality, despite a dip to 41 in Period 4 (possibly due to stockouts or timing). The average demand from Periods 1-4 is 66. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 365 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, the order from Period 1 (71 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. To calculate mu_hat, I use the average demand of the last 4 periods (66 units) across the (L+1) horizon, where L=4. This results in mu_hat = (1+4) * 66 = 330. For sigma_hat, I use the standard deviation of all available samples (including the initial history) to capture the high volatility seen during this transition into the Spring season.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first shipment (ordered P1) arrived in P5 with exactly the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). On-hand inventory is 42, with a substantial pipeline of 348 units. Demand has been volatile: after a spike in P2-P3 (91, 94), it dropped in P4-P5 (41, 29). This cooling suggests the initial 'Spring' spike was a front-loaded seasonal burst or inventory pull-forward, and demand is now stabilizing at a lower but still significant level compared to January. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this post-January regime shift (avg ~64) which balances the spike and the recent drop. I will maintain L at default (4) as confirmed by the P5 arrival. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (4+1)=5 periods of demand, while the cap will prevent over-ordering given the massive pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P5 arrival of P1 order). Demand regime shift post-January confirmed: P2-P5 average is 63.75 units compared to January's 45.8, though recent P4-P5 show a cooling trend from the P2-P3 peak.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on Period 5 and 6 arrivals. Total pipeline inventory is high (333 units), involving orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6. For demand, we observed a massive spike in late February (Periods 2-3: ~92 units/period) followed by a return to more moderate levels in March (Periods 4-6: ~41 units/period). This suggests the initial spring burst was front-loaded. Using the last 5 samples (N=5 from Periods 2-6) covers both the peak and the subsequent cooling, yielding a mean demand of approximately 62 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering Periods 2-6) provides an estimate of (1+L)*62 = 310 units. Since current on-hand (56) + in-transit (333) = 389 units, which already exceeds our expected base stock requirement for a Lead Time of 4, the OR backend's capped policy will likely minimize new orders to prevent overstocking as we exit the initial spring peak.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a Women's V-neck T-shirt. Historically, demand peaked in February (Periods 2-3) and then stabilized. Recent demand reflects typical spring seasonality (Period 7: 89 units). Looking at lead times, we have three confirmed deliveries (P1, P2, P3) all arriving with an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: we have 66 units on-hand and 263 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). Specifically, the P4 order of 127 units is expected to arrive this period (P8). For parameters, I am using L=default (4). For mu_hat, demand has been volatile (ranging from 29 to 94 in the post-January regime). I will use a recent_N of 6 samples to capture the post-January spring shift while smoothing the abrupt peak/dip seen in March (mean ~61.3). This results in a mu_hat covering L+1 periods (5 * 61.3 = 306.5). Sigma_hat uses recent_N=6 to reflect this increased volatility compared to the initial January baseline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are entering the peak spring season for this women's jersey V-neck T-shirt. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). Demand has transitioned from a January mean of ~46 to a spring regime (P2-P8) mean of ~68.6. Recent demand (P7-P8) is higher at ~85.5. I will use recent_N with N=7 (covering the post-January shift) to capture this higher demand regime while maintaining stability. Current inventory (111 on-hand + 244 in-transit = 355 total) is healthy, covering ~5 periods of demand at the current rate (~70 units/period). Setting L to default (4) as lead-time has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime for SKU 554772003 (Everyday Basics) established: mean demand from P2-P8 stabilized at approximately 69 units, significantly higher than January's 46 units (+50%). Target inventory should reflect this elevated baseline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are in the peak spring season for this 'Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. Historical lead times for the last five arrivals (P5-P9) have consistently matched the promised lead time of 4 periods. The demand regime has shifted since Period 2. The pre-February mean was ~45, while the mean from Period 2 to Period 9 is 67.25 units. Recent demand (P6-P9) averages 70.75 units, indicating a stable but high spring baseline. The 'carry-over insight' from P9 confirms this stabilization around 69-70 units. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture this post-January demand regime (P2-P9) and to provide sufficient target inventory for the (L+1) period horizon (5 periods). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the localized volatility of this spring regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck tee, which is in a high-demand Spring/Summer season. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P5-P10 arrivals). Demand analysis: January mean was ~45; since P2, demand has fluctuated but maintained a higher average. Recent demand (P7-P10) has been 89, 82, 58, 92, resulting in a 4-period average of 80.25 units. The overall average from P2-P10 (9 periods) is 70 units. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a service level of 95% is targeted. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the sustained higher demand regime of the Spring season (P2-P10) while moderating the extreme volatility seen in individual weeks. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~350-400 units), accounting for the 269 units currently in transit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29) shows a stockout caused by a massive demand surge in P11 (146 units), the highest recorded. This surge aligns with late April/early May seasonality for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (T-shirts). The last 4 periods (P8-P11) have averaged 94.5 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~69. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Pipeline inventory is 345 units, but current on-hand is 0. To prevent further lost sales during this high-demand spring peak, I will set mu_hat using the recent 4-period average (94.5 * 5 = 472.5) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to pull in more inventory, while maintaining sigma_hat on the recent window to account for increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Demand spiked to 146 units, increasing the 4-week average to 94.5 (approx +37% over the previous 69-unit baseline), indicating a late-spring peak for jersey basics.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (Period 8 order arrived in Period 12). Current inventory status is low: 34 units on-hand with significant pipeline inventory (393 units). Current demand shows a late-spring peak. Period 11 saw a spike of 146 units, while Period 12 settled at 74 units. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 96.5, which is roughly 40% higher than the previous 69-unit baseline. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this elevated demand regime (mean 96.5). Sigma_hat will also be set using recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility (std dev approx 36.5). Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4, consistent with historical observations.

Carry-over insight: Late-spring demand peak confirmed for Periods 11-12: Mean demand increased from 69 to 96.5 (+40%) for 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted top.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' top shows a significant increase starting in Period 11, with demand averaging approximately 97 units over the last three periods (146, 74, 72). This matches the 'Late-spring peak' identified in carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 49 units on-hand and high pipeline inventory, the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). Period 11's spike to 146 suggests high volatility during this seasonal transition. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current 97-unit average, and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the recent variance, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the late-spring regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. This is a V-neck jersey fitted top (Everyday Basics), which is a staple item experiencing consistent spring demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on history (P10 arrived P14). Demand has shifted since mid-April (Period 11), with the average demand for the last 4 periods (P11-P14) being 95.25 units, compared to the previous regime's ~69 units. This represents a sustained jump of ~38%. We currenty have very low on-hand inventory (5 units) and need to maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts while waiting for the larger orders from P12-P14 to arrive. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for roughly 95-100 units/period over the (L+1) risk window.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. We are in the late-spring/early-summer season for SKU 554772003 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck). Demand has remained elevated following the shift identified in Period 11, with recent weekly demands of 146, 74, 72, 89, and 94. The average demand over the last 5 weeks (P11-P15) is 95 units per week, which is significantly higher than the mid-spring average of 69. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P15 arrival from P11 order confirms this). Although on-hand inventory is low (16 units), there is a massive pipeline of 494 units (orders from P12-P15), which includes large orders of 156, 156, 131, and 51 units. To avoid a significant overstocking situation as we move toward the end of the spring season, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-week average (N=5) to capture the current 95-unit baseline, and use the recent 5-week period for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L will remain at the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Late-spring/early-summer demand regime for 'Womens Everyday Basics' established: average demand from P11-P15 is 95 units (+37% over previous baseline of 69 units).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd. We are in a sustained late-spring/early-summer demand regime for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. Historical demand analysis shows the following: Jan (approx 46), Feb-April (approx 69), and May-present (approx 95). The last six periods (P11-P16) have shown demand values of 146, 74, 72, 89, 94, and 103, resulting in an average of 96.3 units. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 69 and a large in-transit pipeline of 414 units (scheduled arrivals from orders in P13, P14, P15, and P16), we are well-positioned for upcoming demand. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will set a base stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) at approx 96 units/period, minus pipeline inventory, ensuring high service levels while managing holding costs as shipments arrive.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10, entering the peak summer period for SKU 554772003 (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt). Demand has stabilized at a high level; the average demand from Period 11 to Period 17 is approximately 96.5 units, confirming the late-spring/early-summer regime shift noted in Carry-Over Insights. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 127 units with 357 units in-transit (P14-P17 orders). To maintain high service levels during this seasonal peak and avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I will move the mu_hat forecast to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this 96-unit demand baseline. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' for N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a staple V-neck jersey top. Demand had stabilized in a late-spring regime (P11-P15) with an average of approximately 95 units per week. However, the last three periods (P16-P18) show demand of 103, 98, and 45. The drop to 45 in P18 might be a random fluctuation or the start of a post-peak cooling period, but given the moving average is still elevated, I will use recent_N to capture the transition. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P11-P18) have a mean demand of 90.1 units. A lead time of 4 is consistently observed and confirmed by all arrival messages from P5 to P18. On-hand inventory is healthy at 213, and there is a significant pipeline of 316 units, which should cover the (L+1) horizon. Setting N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will balance the recent peak with the latest drop, avoiding over-reaction to the single P18 data point while recognizing the established seasonal baseline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24). The SKU 554772003 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted V-neck t-shirt. Based on historical data and seasonal context, we observed a demand regime increase in Period 11 (mid-April) that remained elevated through Period 17, with demand averaging approximately 96 units during that window. However, in the last two periods (P18-P19), demand has dropped significantly to 45 and 73 units respectively (Avg = 59). This likely indicates the passing of the late-spring/early-summer peak and a return toward the mid-spring baseline (~69 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (191) following the arrival of large orders placed during the peak. To prevent overstocking and high holding costs as demand cools, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 5-period window (P15-P19), which captures the end of the peak and the recent drop, resulting in a mean of ~73 units. L is set to calculate as lead times have consistently been the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand cooling detected: Demand transitioned from a high-peak regime (~96 units/period, P11-P17) to a lower summer regime (~59 units/period, P18-P19), signaling the end of the spring/early-summer seasonal spike.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/1. We are entering the core summer period for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck fitted T-shirt. Historical data from P18-P20 shows demand levels of 45, 73, and 87 (mean ~68). This confirms a cooling from the late-spring peak (average ~96) but remains higher than January's baseline (~46). Demand in Period 20 increased to 87, suggesting that while the peak is over, summer demand for basic tees is still robust and somewhat volatile. On-hand inventory is 180 and in-transit is 234, totaling 414 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average (P18-P20) to capture the post-peak summer baseline (approx 68 units/period). With L=4, the coverage target (L+1) is 5 periods. 5 * 68 = 340. Current inventory position (414) is above this, so the OR backend will naturally reduce the order size to prevent overstocking during the summer tail.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak summer demand regime confirmed (P18-P20): Mean demand approx 68 units/period, down from spring/early-summer peak of 96 (-29%) but significantly higher than winter baseline of 46.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8), demand for the 'Bob V-neck' womens fitted top has stabilized into a post-peak summer regime. The intense late-spring/early-summer spike (average ~96 units, P11-P17) has subsided. Analysis of the most recent four periods (P18-P21) shows demand values of 45, 73, 87, and 86, resulting in a mean of 72.75 units. This is a clear cooling from the peak but remains elevated compared to the early-year baseline (~46 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P21's arrival of the P17 order). With 193 units on-hand and 142 units in-transit (total 335), and a projected demand of ~73 per period across the lead time + current period (5 periods total), our current inventory level is slightly high (335 vs. requirement of approx 365). I will use the recent 4-period regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect this stabilized summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak summer demand regime confirmed (P18-P21): Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 73 units/period, following the late-spring peak of 96.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey tops has stabilized in a post-peak summer regime following the late-spring surge. Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has averaged 71.8 units (45, 73, 87, 86, 68), which is significantly lower than the peak of ~96 units but higher than the initial winter baseline. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 18 order in Period 22. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio for the service level is 0.95. The current on-hand inventory (215) and in-transit units (153) are sufficient to cover near-term demand, but the lead time (L=4) requires a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the current regime) to align the OR backend's forecast with the current 71.8 units/period mean, and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the volatility of this specific phase.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak summer demand regime stable (P18-P22): Mean demand is 71.8 units/period, down from the spring peak of 96 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The demand for the 'Bob V-neck' fitted T-shirt has stabilized in a post-peak summer regime. Over the last 6 periods (P18-P23), demand has averaged 70.1 units (45, 73, 87, 86, 68, 62), showing significant stabilization compared to the earlier spring/summer peak of ~96 units. The most recent three periods (P21-P23) show a slight downward trend (86, 68, 62), averaging 72 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (183 units) and substantial in-transit stock (177 units), the pipeline is well-saturated. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this stabilized summer demand regime (approx 70 units/period) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which allows the OR backend to set a base stock that respects the current lower but stable demand profile while safely drawing down excess inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772003 (Women's Everyday Basics V-neck) has transitioned into a stable post-peak summer regime. Demand over the last 7 periods (P18-P24) has averaged 67.5 units, significantly lower than the late-spring peak of ~96 units but remaining higher than the winter baseline (~45 units). Recent demand in the last 3 periods (P22-P24) shows a further cooling trend with an average of 60.6 units (68, 62, 52). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 146 and in-transit at 211, the current pipeline is sufficient to cover estimated demand for the next few periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the post-peak mean and use recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility in this stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak summer demand regime for P18-P24 stabilized with a mean of 67.5 units/period, down from the spring/early-summer peak of 96 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th. Demand for the 'Bob V-neck' (a womens jersey basic) has entered a late-summer cooling phase. Comparing the previous 4-week demand (P21-P24 avg: ~67 units) to the most recent period (P25: 36 units), there is a significant drop. This is consistent with the end of summer seasonality for light jersey tops. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 117 units, and in-transit is 244 units (total pipeline 361). Given the sharp drop in demand in P25 and the previous cooling trend noted since P18, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent local average (approx 61 units) while allowing the OR backend to adjust for the lower sales volume. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the current volatility in this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 25: Demand dropped to 36 units, significantly below the P18-P24 post-peak average of 67.5 units, signaling a further cooling of summer demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $882.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 25-26) suggests a secondary downward regime shift for this SKU ('Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck), as demand has dropped from the post-peak summer average of ~70 to an average of ~45.5 units over the last two periods. This aligns with late August cooling for basic summer tops. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the Period 26 arrival from Period 22. With 163 units on-hand and 155 in-transit (total 318), and expected demand significantly lower than previous months, the current inventory position is high. To avoid excessive holding costs during this cooling phase, I am adjusting mu_hat using a smaller N (recent_N=5) to capture the cooling trend while maintaining L=4. This will likely result in lower or zero orders for the current period until the pipeline is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Secondary cooling of summer demand confirmed at Period 26: Mean demand for P25-P26 is 45.5 units, down from the previous post-peak mean of 67.5 (-33%), reflecting end-of-summer seasonality.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19th, 2019. We are observing an end-of-summer cooling trend for the SKU (a fitted jersey V-neck t-shirt). Historical demand shows a transition from a spring/early-summer peak (~96 units) to a post-peak summer mean (~70 units), and most recently to a further cooled regime starting around Period 25. Demand for Periods 25, 26, and 27 was 36, 55, and 54 respectively, averaging 48.33 units. This confirms the secondary cooling identified in the carry-over insights. Total inventory position (on-hand 163 + in-transit 101 = 264) is currently quite high relative to this new demand level (approx 5 periods of cover at 48 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent cooling trend accurately and avoid over-ordering during the seasonal decline. The high on-hand inventory should buffer any volatility while the order quantity naturally tapers down.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. Historical demand shows a clear cooling trend from the spring/early-summer peak (~96 units/period). The most recent demand regime (P25-P28) shows a mean of 52 units/period (36, 55, 54, 63), which aligns with the end of summer for a basic cotton jersey top. Lead times have been consistently stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 149 units with 69 units in-transit (orders from P25, P26, and P28). Given the cooling trend and the shift towards late-August/early-September, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining sufficient stock for the transition into fall. This will help minimize holding costs without risking stockouts as demand stabilizes at this lower baseline.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed for P25-P28: Mean demand stabilized at approximately 52 units/period, down from the post-peak summer mean of 67.5 units (-23%), reflecting late-summer/pre-fall seasonality.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted tops has stabilized into a late-summer/pre-fall regime. As identified in the Period 29 carry-over insight, the mean demand for the period P25-P29 (the last 5 periods) is 50.6 units (36, 55, 54, 63, 45). This is a significant decrease from the summer peak but higher than the initial winter baseline. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods (P29 saw the arrival of the P25 order). On-hand inventory is healthy at 144 units with 100 units in-transit (P26-P29 orders). I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized late-summer demand level and avoid over-ordering as we move further into the autumn season.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Period 30 demand was significantly low (17 units), following a trend of stabilization in the low 50s. The 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck is moving into the early autumn season. While the last period was an outlier on the low side, the overall regime for P25-P30 has an average demand of 45 units per period. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (139) plus in-transit (136) total 275 units, which covers approximately 6 periods of demand at the current 45-unit rate. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P25-P30) to capture the late-summer/pre-fall cooling trend, as the previous summer regime (~67 units) is no longer valid.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Demand dropped to 17 units, contributing to a lower late-summer/pre-fall average of approximately 45 units/period (P25-P30), down from the previous regime of 52 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/16. We are in a late-summer/early-fall cooling regime. Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted top has significantly decreased from its spring peak (~96 units) and summer post-peak (~70 units) to a current regime of approximately 41 units/period (average of P25-P31). Specifically, the last two periods (P30-P31) saw very low demand (17 and 28 units), suggesting a potential further drop as we Enter the autumn season. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The Period 27 order of 0 units failed to arrive in Period 31 (as expected, since 0 was ordered), but it confirms the pipeline is moving correctly. On-hand is 111 units with 147 in-transit. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 (P25-P31) to capture the current low-demand regime (mean ~41) while accounting for the recent volatility. This provides a base_stock target intended to bridge the current inventory to the expected lower seasonal demand levels.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck has entered a significant late-summer/early-fall cooling phase. Over the last 8 periods (P25-P32), mean demand has dropped to approximately 39 units per period, with recent activity (P30-P32) averaging only 17 units. The order from Period 27 (0 units) correctly reflected the lack of arrivals expected, and the arrival in P32 confirmed that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P28 order arrived in P32 conclude). With 122 units on hand and 146 in transit, we are currently over-inventoried for the present demand level (approx. 6.8 periods of stock at a 39-unit mean). However, the OR backend's capping mechanism will naturally limit ordering. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current lower demand regime while avoiding over-reaction to the extremely low last three weeks, and maintain the standard lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late-summer/pre-fall (P25-P32): Mean demand has stabilized at approximately 39 units/period, a 42% decrease from the previous post-peak summer mean of 67.5 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772003 (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck) is experiencing a sustained reduction in demand as the season transitions from summer to early autumn. The recent demand regime (P25-P33) has settled at a mean of approximately 32 units/period (36, 55, 54, 63, 45, 17, 28, 6, 19), which is a significant drop from the mid-summer average of 67.5 and the late-spring peak of 96. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P30-P33) show an even lower average of 17.5 units, although we must be careful not to over-react to the very low P32 data. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite the P27 order being skipped (which correctly results in no arrival for P31). Current inventory (On-hand: 174, In-transit: 75) is very high relative to the current demand trend (total coverage ~249 units vs. expected 5-period demand of ~160 units at the P25-P33 average). I will use N=9 for mu_hat to capture the post-summer cooling (P25-P33) while maintaining a conservative buffer against further volatility. L remains calculated at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late-summer/early-fall (P25-P33) confirmed: Mean demand has dropped to 32.1 units/period, roughly 50% lower than the post-peak summer mean of 67.5 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted top is currently in a late-summer/early-fall cooling regime. Observed demand in the last five periods (P30-P34) has been 17, 28, 6, 19, and 11, resulting in a mean of approximately 16.2 units/period. This is significantly lower than the previous regime (P25-P28) which averaged ~52 units. On-hand inventory is high at 211 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the current demand rate for the next several periods, especially considering the 4-period lead time. Pipeline inventory includes 11 units from P31, 16 units from P32, and 3 units from P34. One shipment (P27) appears to be lost or severely delayed as it has not arrived by Period 35 (promised P31). Given the high on-hand stock and low demand, I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) to avoid over-ordering and minimize holding costs while the OR backend burns through existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime for early fall (P30-P34) confirmed: Mean demand has dropped to 16.2 units/period, a ~50% decrease from the late-summer mean of 32.1 units. Shipment from Period 27 (ordered 0 units - n/a) and Period 31 (11 units) are monitored for lead time consistency.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772003 (Women's Everyday Basics V-neck) is currently in an early fall low-demand regime. Demand from Period 30 to Period 35 has been consistently low, with observations of 17, 28, 6, 19, 11, and 12 units (mean of ~15.5 units). On-hand inventory is very high at 210 units, which covers over 13 periods of demand at the current rate. Pipelines are mostly clear, with only 19 units in transit. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock levels and declining demand, the OR backend needs to stop ordering to allow inventory to deplete and minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture the current low-demand regime (P30-P35) while maintaining the default lead time.

Carry-over insight: Early fall low-demand regime (P30-P35) confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at approximately 15.5 units/period, a significant drop from the late-summer mean of ~39 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted tops has significantly declined as we enter mid-October (early fall), and the trend is stable. Historical demand for the most recent 7 periods (P30-P36) reflects an average of approximately 14 units per period (17, 28, 6, 19, 11, 12, 6). Current on-hand inventory is 220 units, which is extremely high (covering over 15 periods of current demand) compared to the current demand regime. With 3 units in-transit (ordered in P34), total pipeline inventory is 223. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high inventory levels and the seasonal cooling, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 periods (N=7) to reflect the low-demand regime and prevent unnecessary ordering while maintaining a healthy service level for the remaining stock.

Carry-over insight: Early fall low-demand regime (P30-P36) confirmed: Mean demand has dropped to approximately 14 units/period, down from the late-summer mean of ~32 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772003 (Women's Jersey V-neck) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime characteristic of late autumn/early fall. Demand for the last 8 periods (P30-P37) has remained consistently low, with a mean of approximately 13.5 units/period (values: 17, 28, 6, 19, 11, 12, 6, 9), a significant drop from the summer and spring peaks. On-hand inventory is very high at 211 units, which is more than sufficient to cover demand for the remaining 10 periods of the simulation at current run rates. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory levels and low demand, the OR backend needs to minimize holding costs by avoiding further orders. Setting mu_hat using the most recent 8 periods (N=8) correctly captures this new low-demand baseline while the high on-hand/in-transit balance will naturally lead the system to place zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Late-fall low-demand regime (P30-P37) confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at approximately 13.5 units/period, down from the early-fall mean of 16 units and late-summer mean of ~32 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772003 (Women's Jersey V-neck) is currently in a late-fall low-demand regime. Demand over the last 9 periods (P30-P38) has averaged approximately 12.9 units per period (17, 28, 6, 19, 11, 12, 6, 9, 7). The most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) show an even lower average of 9 units. With 207 units on-hand and 0 in-transit (as the small orders from P31 and P34 have now arrived), the inventory position is extremely high relative to current demand (~23 periods of cover). There is no immediate risk of stockout. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting parameters to 'recent_N' with N=9 captures the current low-demand regime effectively, and since the on-hand inventory already significantly exceeds the backend-calculated base stock, the OR engine will continue to produce zero orders as desired to bleed down excess stock and minimize holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a late-fall/early-winter low-demand regime for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted top. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P30-P39) is approximately 11.5 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) averaging only 8.4 units. Period 39 demand was 8 units. With 199 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit, we have roughly 17-23 periods of cover at current demand rates. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P38 arrival from P34 order). Because on-hand inventory is significantly above any reasonable base stock level needed to cover L+1 periods (which would be roughly 70-100 units even with a safety buffer), the goal is to stop ordering and allow on-hand inventory to deplete to minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period regime to reflect this cooling, which will result in the OR backend calculating a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Early winter demand regime (P35-P39) confirmed: Mean demand has slowed further to ~8.4 units/period, down from the previous late-fall average of ~13.5 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, heading into late-year winter seasonality. The SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a low-demand regime. Average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) is 7.2 units/period, confirming a sustained slow-down compared to the early fall regime (~15 units). On-hand inventory is 193 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and low current demand, the inventory position already covers over 25 periods of demand at the current rate (193 / 7.2 \u2248 26.8). Any additional ordering would only increase holding costs without improving service levels. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the most recent regime (N=5) and allow the OR backend to determine that no new order is necessary. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late winter demand regime (P36-P40) confirmed: Mean demand has slowed further to ~7.2 units/period, a significant decrease from the early fall average (~15 units) and late-fall average (~13.5 units).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). Demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck fitted top remains in a late-season low-demand regime, with demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) averaging only 7.4 units/period (9, 7, 8, 6, 7). On-hand inventory is currently 186 units with zero units in-transit. Given the current low demand, 186 units provides over 20 periods of coverage, which far exceeds the lead-time requirements (L+1 = 5). No further orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent mean of ~7-8 units/period using recent_N=5 to minimize further stock accumulation and account for the significant drop from earlier seasonal peaks.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Period 42 saw a significant demand jump to 23 units, compared to the late-winter average of ~7 units (P36-P40). This likely signals a December/Holiday demand spike for this basic jersey top. However, on-hand inventory is currently very high at 163 units, which is more than enough to cover even a continued spike at this level over the remaining 5 periods of the game (total demand at 23/unit would only be 115). Pipeline is empty, but no new orders are needed given the high on-hand balance and the goal of minimizing ending inventory to reduce holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the recent uptick while still keeping base stock targets low relative to current inventory.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected at Period 42: Demand increased to 23 units from a late-winter average of 7.2 units (+219%).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), following a holiday demand spike in Period 42 (23 units). The product is a Women's Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt, which typically sees low demand in winter (averaging ~7-10 units excluding spikes). On-hand inventory is high at 157 units with zero in-transit. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (44, 45, 46, 47) and a promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in the final resolution of Period 48 (outside the game horizon). Therefore, placing additional orders would only increase holding costs without any possibility of generating additional sales. Given the current inventory of 157 units and an expected demand of less than 15-20 units per period for the remainder of the winter, we have more than enough stock to satisfy all remaining demand. I am setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to minimize any further ordering by the OR backend.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (Dec 16). Historical demand shows a persistent low-demand regime for this SKU ('Womens Everyday Basics' fitted top) during the winter months, with a brief spike in Period 42 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact). The last few weeks (P43-P44) have returned to very low levels (6 and 2 units respectively). On-hand inventory is currently 155 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate of ~4-8 units per period and only 3 periods remaining in the game (P45, P46, P47). No further orders are necessary as existing stock covers several times the expected demand for the remainder of the horizon. I am setting parameters to reflect the recent extremely low demand (last 5 periods inclusive of the spike, N=5) to ensure no new orders are triggered while maintaining a realistic statistical model for the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime (P40-P44) confirmed: Excluding the holiday spike in P42, mean demand has dropped to ~5 units/period. On-hand inventory is sufficient to cover all remaining periods in the game.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 of 47, which is the penultimate period of the simulation. The current date is December 23, 2019. The demand context is a very low-volume winter regime for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey tops, with demand consistently below 10 units (averaging ~5 units excluding a minor holiday spike in P42). On-hand inventory is currently 147 units with 0 units in transit. Since the game ends next period (Period 47) and the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would not arrive before the game concludes. Furthermore, the on-hand inventory of 147 units is more than enough to cover the expected demand for the final two periods (estimated demand < 20 units total). Therefore, no additional orders are necessary. I will set L to the promised lead time of 4, and use the recent 5-period average (P41-P45) for demand (approx 9.2 units per period) and volatility to maintain a stable but conservative base stock calculation that allows the stock to deplete.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47, the final period of the game. The current context for SKU 554772003 (Women's Everyday Basics V-neck) is a low-demand winter regime. Recent demand (P43-P46) has been extremely low, averaging 5.75 units per period. With 140 units currently on-hand and zero in-transit, our inventory far exceeds any possible demand for the remaining single period (estimated at ~6-8 units). Since this is the final decision phase, ordering more units would only increase holding costs without any potential for additional profit. Therefore, I am setting the parameters to ensure no further orders are placed by keeping the target base stock low while reflecting the current low-demand regime.
