Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 706016015 (high-waisted skinny denim). Historical demand samples for the last 5 weeks show: 484, 413, 366, 244, 255. There is a clear downward trend from early January peaks towards a more stable late January/early February baseline (avg of last two samples is ~250). The promised lead time is 4. Given we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the last 5 samples to estimate mean demand, but weigh the recent stabilization heavily. Using N=5 for mu_hat captures the drop while providing enough volume to prevent stockouts during the 4-period lead time. L is set to default (4).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a downward trend: 484, 413, 366, 244, 255. In Period 1, demand was 227. The average demand across these 6 samples is 331.5. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory because the order placed in Period 1 (522 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 4. We lost sales in Period 1 due to 0 inventory. Given the downward trend from Jan to Feb, I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the more recent, lower demand levels (average ~272 per week) rather than the earlier spikes. This helps prevent over-ordering as the product moves past a possible January peak. L is set to 'default' as we have no confirmed arrival data yet to suggest a lead time shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim (High-waisted jeans). Historical weekly demand (Jan-Feb) was approx 352 units. In the last two periods (Feb 11, Feb 18), demand was 227 and 192, slightly lower than the Jan average. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales. Promised lead time is 4. Total in-transit is 899 (522 from P1 + 377 from P2). These orders are expected to arrive in P5 and P6 respectively. Since we have no actual lead time confirmation yet (as L=4 means first arrival at P5), I will stick to the default L. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples (Jan lead-in + Feb history) show a mean of ~292. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this slightly lower demand regime compared to the early Jan peak.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The SKU is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a basic fashion item. Looking at the demand history (samples plus Periods 1-3), there is a clear downward trend since early January: Jan (484, 413, 366, 244) -> Feb (255, 227, 192, 167). The average demand over the last three concluded periods (Feb 11-Feb 25) is approximately 195 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods; we have not yet seen any arrivals (the order from P1 is expected Arrival Resolution in P5 and visible in P6 start). Total in-transit is 1264 units (Orders P1: 522 + P2: 377 + P3: 365). My goal is to set parameters that reflect the current lower demand level while maintaining the pipeline. I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current regime (~195/week) and use recent_N for sigma to reflect the current volatility. Lead time (L) remains at default as we haven't reached the first delivery window yet.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean weekly demand decreased from ~340 (Jan) to ~195 (Feb), a reduction of approx 40%.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The SKU is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS'. On-hand inventory is 0, while in-transit is 1264 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. No units have arrived yet. Based on the rules, orders placed in Period 1 (N=1) with L=4 should arrive during Period 5 (N+L=1+4=5) and be visible in the status update at the start of Period 6. Thus, the inventory shortage is expected behavior given the 4-period lead time. Demand (mu) has trended downward from initial samples (~350) to the last 4 periods (avg ~182: 227, 192, 167, 141). Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat correctly reflects this regime shift noted in Carry-over insights. For sigma_hat, recent_N=4 captures the current volatility. Lead time L is set to default (4) as no departures from the promised lead time have yet been confirmed via 'conclude' messages.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first shipment (ordered P1) arrived in P5 with exactly the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Using this confirmation, we set L to 'default'. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since February; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P1-P5) is approximately 175.8 units/week. Since the initial high demand in Jan/early Feb is no longer representative of the current 'Divided Collection' (fast fashion) skinny denim trend in late March, I am using recent_N (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime (~176 units/week). With 370 units on hand and 742 units in-transit (reflecting orders from P2 and P3), our pipeline is healthy relative to the current demand (~176 * 5 = 880 units needed for the full review + lead time cycle).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P5 arrival of P1 order). Demand regime stabilized at ~176 units/week (P1-P5 average).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. We are seeing a continued decline in demand for this item (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) from the high Jan/early Feb levels of 300-400+ to a recent average of ~131 units over the last 3 periods (P4-P6). Specifically, demand was 141 (P4), 152 (P5), and 101 (P6). The lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods based on two arrivals (P1 and P2 orders). With 646 units on-hand and 365 units in-transit (expected in P7, ordered in P3), the total current pipeline is 1,011 units. Given the declining trend and high current stock relative to the ~130-150 weekly demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma estimation to capture the most recent lower-demand regime. This helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering while we work through existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Weekly demand further softened from ~176 (P1-P5) to ~131 (P4-P6 average).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). Past 5 weeks of demand (P3-P7): 167, 141, 152, 101, 124. This shows a sustained downward shift compared to initial January samples (~350). The mean for these 5 periods is 137 units. Current inventory is high (On-hand: 887) due to arrivals from orders placed in P1-P3. In-transit is now 0. Lead time is confirmed as a steady 4 periods based on P5, P6, and P7 arrivals. Calculated target stock (1+L)*mu = 5 * 137 = 685. Since current on-hand (887) exceeds this target, the OR engine will likely place zero or minimal orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this lower regime, and keep the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing a Trousers SKU (high-waisted denim). Historical data shows a clear downward trend in demand from January peaks (average 350+) to a stabilized lower range in February/March (average ~130-150). Recent demand samples (P4-P8: 141, 152, 101, 124, 141) yield a mean of 131.8 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The current on-hand inventory is 746 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 659 units (131.8 * 5). Our current inventory of 746 units comfortably exceeds this, meaning no new order is required this period. I will set the OR parameters to reflect the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) and the confirmed lead time to allow the backend to maintain this safety level without over-ordering.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/15. On-hand inventory is 658 units with 0 units in-transit. Demand has significantly cooled from January levels (~350) and February levels (~200). Recent demand (P6-P9) averages 113.5 units/week (101, 124, 141, 88). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 658 units on hand and a mean demand around 114, we have over 5 periods of stock, which covers the (L+1)=5 week lead time window. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the current lower demand regime (approx 113.5 * 5 = 567.5). The OR backend will likely not place an order because current inventory (658) > base stock (~568 + safety stock). This is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs as demand continues to trend lower.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further at a lower level: P6-P9 average demand is 114 units/week, down from late Feb/early March levels (~130-170).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has been steadily declining from January peaks (~400s) to late April lows, with the most recent sample at 62 units. The average demand over the last four periods (P7-P10) is approximately 104 units/week, significantly lower than earlier regimes. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. My current on-hand inventory is 596 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At a forecast of ~100 units/week, I need approximately 500 units. My current inventory of 596 units is already above this base stock level, so I do not need to order more. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent low-demand trend (averaging roughly 103 units/week), which effectively signals the backend to stop ordering while I bleed off excess stock. Sigma_hat is also calculated over recent history to reflect the reduced volatility at these lower volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 8-10 average is ~97 units/week, down from Period 4-7 average of ~130 units/week.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016015' (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is experiencing a sustained downward trend in demand that started in February (~195 units/week) and has consistently dropped through March and April. The last four weeks (Period 8-11) show demand of 141, 88, 62, and 48, averaging ~85 units/week. The current on-hand inventory is 548 units. Given a lead time (L) of 4 periods, the next decision coverage window (L+1) is 5 periods. At a current demand rate of ~85 units/week, we require approximately 425 units of inventory to cover the lead time. Current on-hand (548) plus in-transit (34) equals 582 units, which is significantly higher than the projected need. To prevent excessive holding costs and maximize profit, I will use a recent_N method (N=4) to reflect the most recent low-demand regime and help the OR engine minimize further orders while the excess inventory is depleted. The lead time L is confirmed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: Period 8-11 average demand is ~85 units/week, down 40% from Period 4-7 average (~140).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016015' is a fashion denim item (Jade HW Skinny Denim). Analysis of recent demand (Period 8-12) shows a clear and sustained downward trend: demand has averaged only 80.6 units per week over the last 5 periods (141, 88, 62, 48, 64), which is significantly lower than the early February peak (~200+). Currently, the inventory position is 484 units on-hand plus 34 in-transit (total 518), against a lead time of 4 periods. With a 5-period horizon (L+1), expected demand at current rates is approximately 403 units (80.6 * 5). Given the current stock of 518 units, we are oversupplied compared to the current demand regime. The lead time is stable at 4 periods as previously confirmed. To minimize holding costs while the stock depletes to match the new demand level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the recent decline and sigma_hat similarly to reflect narrowed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: Period 8-12 average demand is ~81 units/week, down from Period 8-11 average of ~85.

Daily Reward (R_t): $756.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the high-waisted skinny denim trousers (SKU 706016015) has continued to decline and stabilize at a much lower level than the initial Jan/Feb samples. Over the last 6 periods (Periods 8-13), the average demand is approximately 77.5 units/week (141, 88, 62, 48, 64, 62). The most recent three periods (P11-P13) show an even tighter average of 58 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. Currently, the on-hand inventory (422) plus in-transit (54) totals 476 units, which is over 6 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. Given the promised lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect this lower regime (approx 77.5 * 5 = 387.5), and using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the decreased volatility. Since current inventory (476) exceeds our expected base stock (approx 387.5 + safety stock), the OR backend will likely not place a significant new order, allowing on-hand stock to bleed down and minimize further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level: Period 8-13 average is 77.5 units/week, down from Feb/Mar averages (>130).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant and sustained downward trend from ~400+ in early January to a stabilized average of approximately 61 units per week over the last four periods (P11-P14: 48, 64, 62, 69). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on early arrivals (P5, P6, P7). With 353 units on-hand and 90 units in-transit (total pipeline of 443), and expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1) being approximately 305 units (at 61/week), we are currently overstocked. However, to maintain the correct base stock level in the OR engine, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new lower-demand regime (mu_hat calculation will be (1+4) * 61 = 305). This informs the system of the lower demand and prevents significant replenishment orders until the on-hand inventory depletes to appropriate levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~61 units/week (Period 11-14 average), representing a 50% decrease from the February plateau (~130).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Late May/Early June (2019/5/27). Demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has shown a long-term downward trend since February, dropping from averages over 200/week to a current low-level stable regime of approx 50-70 units per week. The last 5 periods (P11-P15) show a mean demand of 58.4 units per week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P11 order arriving in P15). We have 338 units on-hand and 56 in-transit (orders from P13 and P14), totaling 394 units against a weekly demand of ~60. This inventory level covers approximately 6.5 weeks of demand, which is sufficient given the 4-period lead time. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current low-demand stability, and sigma_hat similarly to prevent over-ordering during this downward seasonal phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~58 units/week (Period 11-15 average), slightly lower than the previous insight of ~61.

Daily Reward (R_t): $382.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd. Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has shown a consistent downward trend since February, stabilizing at a much lower level. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), demand has averaged approximately 56 units per week. The most recent demand (P16) was only 36 units, which is the lowest recorded yet, suggesting that the product might be reaching the end of its seasonal life cycle as temperatures rise in early June. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (302) plus in-transit stock (56) totals 358 units. Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At a forecast of ~50-55 units/week, our current total stock of 358 is sufficient to cover over 6.5 weeks of demand. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining demand regime, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the most recent regime shift. No new orders are expected to be generated by the OR backend as current inventory levels are high relative to the forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: Period 12-16 average demand is ~56 units/week, down from the previous ~61 units/week signal. Demand appears to be tapering off as summer begins.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (heavy denim) continues to decline as summer arrives, with the recent 5-week average (Periods 13-17) at 47.6 units/week and the most recent observation at only 22 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 300 units, which at the current low demand rate represents over 6 weeks of stock. Pipeline inventory is 36 units (ordered Period 14, expected to arrive in Period 18). Total inventory (336 units) significantly exceeds the projected base stock requirement for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 240 units). Consequently, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand trend (N=5) and sigma_hat to default to account for the increasing volatility as demand tapers off.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: Period 13-17 average demand is ~48 units/week, a significant drop from the ~60 units/week observed in early May. Confirming seasonal decline for denim trousers in summer months.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' continues its seasonal decline as summer progresses. The demand for the most recent 5 periods (Periods 14-18) has averaged 40.8 units/week, with the last two weeks dropping significantly to 22 and 24 units. On-hand inventory is 312 units and there are 257 units in transit (expected in 4 periods), totaling 569 units. Given the low demand and high inventory levels, the current stock covers approximately 14 weeks of demand at current rates, well exceeding the (L+1) requirement. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent average of ~41 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages from Period 15, 17, and 18. This approach ensures mu_hat is aligned with the summer trough to prevent over-ordering while maintaining enough coverage for the OR backend logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: Period 14-18 average is ~41 units/week, down from the Period 13-17 average of ~48 units/week. The summer seasonal low for denim is firmly established.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). The SKU is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim NRS', which is a denim product typically seeing lower demand in summer. Historical demand has continued to decrease throughout May and June: Demand for the last five periods (P15-P19) was 49, 36, 22, 24, and 34, averaging ~33 units/week. This confirms the summer seasonal low noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P15, P17, P18). Current on-hand is 278 and in-transit is 257 (from a large order in P18). With a total inventory position of 535 and an expected weekly demand of ~33, we are well-covered for several months. No new orders are needed. \u03bc\u0302 is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current summer demand level (~33 * 5 = 165). \u03c3\u0302 is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed summer seasonal trough: Demand from P17-P19 has settled at an average of ~27 units/week, down significantly from the ~60 units/week observed in early May.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. We are in the middle of summer, which is the seasonal trough for denim trousers. Demand over the last three periods (P18-P20) has averaged 28.3 units/week, consistent with the 'summer seasonal trough' identified in Period 20. On-hand inventory is 251 units, which is quite high relative to current demand (~8.8 weeks of supply). Additionally, we have 257 units in-transit (ordered in Period 18, expected arrival Period 22). Total pipeline + on-hand inventory is 508 units, which covers over 17 weeks of current demand. Given this significant overstock position and the low seasonal demand, the priority is to avoid further orders and minimize holding costs. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this low-demand regime (average ~29 units/week) and use the default lead time of 4. This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than our current inventory position, ensuring the OR engine places no new orders.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' spiked in Period 21 to 121 units, a sharp departure from the summer average of ~27 observed in Periods 17-20. This likely marks the beginning of 'Back to School' (BTS) demand, as denim trousers are a core category for this seasonal transition in early July. Comparing the last three samples (Period 19: 34, Period 20: 27, Period 21: 121), the regime has clearly shifted from the summer trough. The mean of these three most recent periods is ~60.67. Given the BTS trend, I expect demand to continue high or increase further. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 130, with a large in-transit shipment of 257 units (ordered P18, expected to arrive P22/P23). By setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3), I allow the backend to respond to this sudden volume increase while the 257 units in transit should buffer the inventory level until further stabilization is observed.

Carry-over insight: Back to School (BTS) demand spike detected at Period 21: Demand increased from summer average of ~27 to 121 units, indicating the end of the summer seasonal trough for denim.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a significant demand shift (Back-to-School/BTS). After a summer trough where demand averaged ~27 units/week (P17-P20), Period 21 and 22 showed a sharp increase to ~121 units/week. This represents a new demand regime as we move into the late summer/early autumn season. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we must set parameters that allow the OR backend to replenish based on this higher plateau rather than the summer lows or the very high volumes of early spring. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this spike (P20: 27, P21: 121, P22: 122), which averages approximately 90 units/week. This provides a balance between the sudden jump and the preceding trough while the new regime stabilizes. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the increased volatility caused by the shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School (BTS) demand regime sustained: Period 21 and 22 demand (121, 122) confirms a jump from summer average (~27) to a new peak plateau of ~120 units/week.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Back-to-School (BTS) demand peak for denim trousers. Demand in the last three periods (P21-P23) has been 121, 122, and 137 units respectively, representing a significant jump from the summer trough of ~27 units. This shift is sustained, so I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime. Average demand for these three periods is 126.67 units/week. Setting mu_hat using N=3 will target a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+4=5 weeks). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P22 arrival of the P18 order. The pipeline inventory (on-hand 128 + in-transit 289 = 417) is being monitored to ensure we maintain service levels during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School (BTS) demand peak fully confirmed: Period 21-23 average demand is ~127 units/week, a massive increase from the summer trough of ~27 units/week.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Back-to-School (BTS) demand peak for denim. Following a massive demand spike in Periods 21-23 (averaging ~127 units), Period 24 saw a moderation to 76 units. However, looking at the historical samples from early 2018 (beginning of the history provided), demand in late January and early February was significantly higher (range 244-484). Given the current date of July 29, we are entering the peak of the BTS season, where high-waisted skinny denim trousers typically see maximum volume. The drop to 76 units in Period 24 is likely a temporary fluctuation within a high-demand regime rather than a descent back to summer levels. To avoid stockouts during this critical period, I am basing mu_hat on the average of the last 4 periods (P21-P24), which is 114 units per week. This results in a forecast of (1+L)*114 = 570. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=4 to capture the high volatility seen during this regime shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Back-to-School (BTS) demand peak for denim. Recent demand from Period 21 to Period 25 shows values of 121, 122, 137, 76, and 140. Apart from a temporary dip in P24, the demand is significantly elevated compared to the summer trough. The mean demand for this new regime (P21-P25) is approximately 119 units/week. In Period 25, we stocked out (0 ending inventory) because demand (140) exceeded on-hand inventory (52). Consequently, we lost 88 units of sales. We have 589 units in-transit (orders from P22, P23, P24, and P25), with the P22 order (109 units) expected to arrive in Period 26 (current period decision phase). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting L to default (4), mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the BTS regime, and sigma_hat using the same N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen in the transition from summer to fall.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School (BTS) demand regime sustained: Period 21-25 average demand is ~119 units/week (excluding Period 25 lost sales impact). Period 25 conclude showed a stockout, confirming demand exceeds current arrival rates.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016015' (Skinny Denim Trousers) is currently in a high-demand Back-to-School (BTS) regime. Period 26 demand reached 180 units, the highest since February, leading to a consecutive stockout (ending inventory 0). The recent 3-period average (P24-P26) is approximately 132 units/week, and the 6-period average (P21-P26) is 129 units/week. Since arrivals are lagging demand and lead time is stable at 4 periods, I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of this elevated demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this peak BTS performance while smoothing the recent jump. L is set to 'calculate' as historical lead times (P5, P6, P7, P15, P17, P18, P22, P26) consistently show 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: BTS Peak continues: Period 26 demand (180 units) confirms the upper bound of the current shift. Period 21-26 average is ~129 units/week, establishing the current seasonal high for denim.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained 'Back-to-School' (BTS) high-demand regime, which began around Period 21. Recent demand observations (P26: 180, P27: 184) indicate that demand is peaking higher than the early BTS average of ~120 units. On-hand inventory is zero due to stockouts in the last three periods, where arrivals only partially satisfied the high demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P22, P26, and P27 arrivals). To avoid further lost sales during this peak, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to a more recent window (N=5) to capture the current plateau of ~140-180 units/week. I will also use a recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level. The goal is for the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) at this elevated demand regime.

Carry-over insight: BTS Peak demand has intensified: Period 26-27 demand average is ~182 units/week, significantly higher than the initial BTS average of ~120.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak of the Back-to-School (BTS) and Fall transition season (late August). Looking at the demand history, we have seen a significant and sustained increase: Period 26 demand was 180, Period 27 was 184, and Period 28 spiked further to 272. We have stocked out for four consecutive periods (P25-P28) because arrivals (capped by earlier, lower forecasts) are insufficient to meet this accelerated demand. The current inventory is 0 on-hand with 661 in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward trajectory from ~180 to 272, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this intensified peak (Avg P26-P28 = 212 units/week). To ensure the OR backend generates a sufficiently large order to break the stockout cycle and cover the (L+1) window, I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility seen during these seasonal shifts (Period 27-28 jump).

Carry-over insight: BTS peak has intensified further: Period 26-28 average demand is ~212 units/week, with Period 28 reaching 272 (a ~50% increase over the early August level). Sustained stockouts since Period 25 confirm demand is outstripping supply.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016015 (denim trousers) is currently in a sustained Back-to-School (BTS) peak. In Period 29, demand was 215, confirming the shift identified since Period 26 (avg ~212). There is a consistent stockout situation: on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (215) exceeded arrivals (158). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P25 order arrived in P29). Total in-transit (pipeline) is 752 (orders from P26-P29). To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P26-P29) which captures the intensified BTS demand (avg 212.75). The OR backend uses (1+L)*demand_avg, covering 1063 units for the lead time plus current period. Since pipeline (752) is less than this requirement, a significant order will be triggered to bridge the gap and satisfy the high seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: BTS peak demand intensified: Period 26-29 average demand is ~213 units/week. Sustained stockouts since Period 25 confirm demand consistently exceeds supply levels despite regular arrivals.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016015' (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a sustained Back-to-School (BTS) peak demand phase. In Period 30, demand hit 300 units, the highest recorded in this regime, leading to a sixth consecutive week of stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0). Since Period 26, weekly demand has averaged approximately 230 units (180, 184, 272, 215, 300). The current 'In-transit' of 933 units corresponds to orders from Periods 27 through 30 (185 + 216 + 249 + 283). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high demand and the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), stock suppression is the primary risk. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this intensified peak (avg ~230/week), and sigma_hat using recent_N of 5 to account for the increasing volatility. This will ensure the base stock levels are high enough to satisfy the clear upward trend in the BTS season.

Carry-over insight: BTS peak demand intensified significantly between Periods 26-30, with demand averaging ~230 units/week (peaking at 300) compared to the previous ~120 units/week early-BTS average. Sustained stockouts since Period 25.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016015' (Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-demand phase driven by the 'Back-to-School' (BTS) season. Over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged approximately 242 units per week, significantly higher than the early-BTS average of ~120. We have experienced consistent stockouts since Period 25 because arrivals haven't kept pace with these peaks. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P30 and P31). To mitigate lost sales and cover the high demand across the review and lead time periods (1+L = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the intensified BTS demand regime (P26-P31), which averages approximately 232 units/week. This will result in a base stock target that accounts for the current high-velocity demand and helps recover from the current zero on-hand inventory position as pipeline inventory arrives.

Carry-over insight: BTS peak demand further intensified: Period 26-31 average demand is 232 units/week, with frequent peaks reaching 270-300. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the peak of the Back-to-School (BTS) season, with demand significantly outstripping supply. Demand over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) has averaged 238.5 units/week (180, 184, 272, 215, 300, 240, 279), with a clear upward trend compared to the early BTS phase. On-hand inventory has been 0 for 8 consecutive periods, resulting in substantial lost sales. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. To restore service levels and capture this high demand, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method. I'll use the recent average of ~240 units/week as the base. Thus, mu_hat = (1 + L) * 240 = 5 * 240 = 1200. I am maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in the weekly demand (ranging from 180 to 300).

Carry-over insight: BTS peak demand further refined: Period 26-32 average demand is ~239 units/week, which is double the initial BTS surge (P21-P24 avg ~114). Frequent stockouts confirm demand remains higher than scheduled arrivals.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016015' (High-waisted skinny denim) has entered a massive peak demand phase. In Period 33, demand skyrocketed to 704 units, more than double the previous peaks of ~300. This suggests we are in the 'super-peak' of the Back-to-School season or a specific fall promotion. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have been stocking out consistently since Period 25. The pipeline (1126 units) is substantial, but given the new demand level (704), we must adjust our base stock significantly to avoid further lost sales. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the 704 figure is a potential outlier or a very sharp regime shift, I will use an explicit forecast that weighs this new high mean while acknowledging the previous regime of ~240 (P26-P32). Setting a base stock to cover (1+L) periods, I'll forecast an average demand of ~350 units/week for the next 5 weeks (1+L), leading to a mu_hat of 1750. For sigma_hat, I will account for the high volatility seen in the jump from 279 to 704.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand hyper-spike detected in Period 33 (704 units), nearly triple the previous 4-week average of ~258. This indicates a transition from the general BTS season to a peak seasonal event or major promotion.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of high demand volatility following a massive hyper-spike in Period 33 (704 units) and a significant demand level in Period 34 (397 units). The current period is Oct 7, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear Back-to-School (BTS) ramp-up starting around Period 21, which intensified significantly from Period 26 onwards (averaging ~230+ units). The Period 33 spike likely represents a peak seasonal event or major promotion. However, Period 34 demand (397) has dropped from that peak but remains significantly higher than the pre-spike BTS average of ~239. To ensure we capture this higher sustained demand level and recover from the persistent stockouts (on-hand is 0), I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 1500. This is calculated as (L+1) * 300, where 300 is a conservative estimate of the current demand regime following the hyper-spike. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. sigma_hat is set explicitly to 450 (sqrt(5) * ~200) to account for the extreme volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Post-hyper-spike demand remains elevated (397 units in P34), suggesting a new high-demand plateau above the previous BTS average of ~230.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a high-demand phase following a major peak in late September (P33: 704 units). While demand cooled to 250 units in P35, this still represents a significant elevation from the early-BTS average (~120). We have transitioned from a phase of chronic stockouts to having some residual inventory (on-hand: 69) as large orders placed during the surge begin to arrive. The in-transit pipeline is very large (1838 units), reflecting the aggressive ordering response to the P33-P34 demand spike. Observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to set a high manual mu_hat to maintain readiness for sustained high demand while allowing the OR backend's inventory cap to regulate the flow, given the massive pipeline. I will use the average of the last 3 periods (P33-P35: ~450 units/week) as the basis for the forecast to capture the recent volatility and high plateau.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime established (Periods 33-35): Following the P33 hyper-spike of 704 units, demand has averaged ~450 units/week, indicating a sustained late-autumn high-demand plateau for denim.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3601.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant expansion in late Q3 and early Q4. After the hyper-spike of 704 in Period 33, demand has moderately retracted but stabilized at a high level (Period 34: 397, Period 35: 250, Period 36: 197). The mean demand of the last five periods (P32-P36) is approximately 365 units. Current lead time is stable at 4 periods. With high-waisted denim, we are likely entering a peak autumn season. I am using a recent_N (N=5) calculation for mu_hat to capture this elevated demand regime while smoothing the hyper-spike. For sigma_hat, recent_N (N=5) is used to capture the high volatility seen during the transition from BTS to the current peak season. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased mean and the substantial variance observed lately.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime stabilized: Average demand for Periods 34-36 is approximately 281 units, significantly lower than the P33 hyper-spike but higher than the early-August levels, suggesting a cooling after a major promotion or peak event.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 34-37: 397, 250, 197, 310) indicates that the peak 'hyper-spike' from Period 33 (704) has subsided, but demand remains significantly higher than the early summer trough and even the initial Back-to-School levels. The average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 289 units/week. While Period 36 was low (197), Period 37 rebounded to 310, suggesting a stabilized autumn/winter baseline for denim. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand and in-transit inventory, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this post-peak stabilization. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current volatility after the massive P33 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Post-hyper-spike demand regime stabilized (Periods 34-37): Demand has averaged ~289 units/week following the late September peak, significantly higher than the August BTS average (~120).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (early November), the SKU 706016015 (high-waisted skinny denim) is transitioning from the post-hyper-spike late-autumn regime. Recent demand (Periods 34-38) has averaged 301 units, following a peak event in Period 33. The last two periods (37 and 38) showed demand of 310 and 348, suggesting a resilient late-autumn plateau as we approach the holiday season. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 420 and a very large pipeline (in-transit) of 1496 units\u2014primarily driven by large orders in Periods 34-36\u2014the current total inventory position is 1916 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) covers the post-peak trend (~301 units/week). Despite the high pipeline, the OR backend's capped policy will manage the risk of over-ordering. I will maintain the recent volatility (sigma_hat) to handle the significant variation seen since the October peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-hyper-spike demand regime (Nov): Demand for Periods 34-38 has averaged ~301 units/week, maintaining a higher plateau than the early-BTS season (~120), indicating sustained late-autumn demand for denim.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the post-peak autumn demand regime for denim. Based on history, demand has transitioned from the 'hyper-spike' in Period 33 (704 units) to a fairly stable late-autumn plateau. Over the last few periods (P35-P39), demand has been 250, 197, 310, 348, and 257. The average for these most recent 5 periods is ~272 units/week. This is significantly higher than the early BTS level (~120) but lower than the hyper-spike. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 795, and we have 864 units in-transit (P36 order of 771 and P37 order of 93). Given the pipeline is mostly full and demand seems to be fluctuating around 270-300, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized post-peak regime and calculate for lead time as it remains reliable at 4. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture the current volatility without being skewed by the massive P33 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime stabilized (Periods 35-39): Demand has averaged ~272 units/week, maintaining a sustained high-demand plateau for late autumn, significantly above the summer and early-BTS levels.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has stabilized following the major peak in Period 33 (September). Over the last five periods (P36-P40), weekly demand has been: 197, 310, 348, 257, 260, averaging ~274 units. This confirms a late-autumn plateau significantly higher than summer or early BTS levels, but much lower than the 700+ hyper-spike. Inventory levels are currently very high (On-hand: 1306) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (P34-P36). With an average demand of ~274 and a lead time of 4, the target base stock is approximately (1+4) * 274 = 1370. Since current On-hand (1306) + In-transit (93) = 1399, and the system is in a high-stock state, I will set parameters to maintain this stabilized demand regime. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak stability (P36-P40), and keeping lead time at the promised 4 periods which has remained consistent.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Periods 36-40) stabilized at an average of ~274 units/week, down from the hyper-peak but significantly higher than the early BTS average (~120).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25. We are in the late autumn/pre-holiday season. Inventory levels are currently high (on-hand: 1156) following a massive surge in orders placed during the September/October hyper-peak (Periods 34-36). The demand has stabilized but remains higher than summer levels. For Period 41, demand was 243 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 283.6 units, and the last 3 periods (P39-P41) average is 253.3 units. The 'Post-peak' regime identified in carry-over insights suggests a range near 270-300 units. To balance the current high on-hand inventory with the risk of stockouts during potential December holiday spikes, I will use a conservative recent window (N=5) for demand forecasting. This includes the higher demand in Period 37-38. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized late Nov: Period 39-41 average demand is ~253 units/week, down from the post-hyper-spike average of ~300 in early November.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a significant demand jump to 598 units, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (late November). This is more than double the late-term average of ~253 observed in early November. With high-waisted skinny denim, this likely represents a seasonal holiday spike. I am shifting the mu_hat forecast to an 'explicit' value to account for this expected holiday volatility. I will set mu_hat (covering 1+L = 5 periods) based on a blended estimate of the recent hyper-spike (around 600) and the previous plateau (around 275). Using a projected average of 450 units/week gives a mu_hat of 2250. Sigma_hat is increased to 350 to provide a buffer for holiday demand variability. On-hand inventory is 558, and with 424 units in-transit, our total coverage is currently low relative to the detected spike. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected Period 42: Demand reached 598 units (approx. 2.4x the November average of ~250), corresponding with Black Friday retail timing.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike (598 units) coinciding with Black Friday, followed by a sharp drop to 131 units in Period 43. Historically, this SKU (denim trousers) shows a secondary peak around the Christmas/Holiday season in December. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (Periods 44-47), orders placed now in Period 44 will arrive in Period 48, which is beyond the game's horizon. Consequently, any inventory needed to satisfy demand for the remainder of the game must come from the current on-hand (427 units) and the existing in-transit pipeline (1132 units). The total inventory position (1559 units) is substantial. To manage remaining demand while minimizing terminal holding costs, I will set parameters to reflect the recent high-volatility demand environment. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to average the Black Friday spike and the subsequent cooling (approx 308 units/week), while sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility seen in the last 4 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand volatility: Period 42-43 showed a swing from 598 to 131 units. Holiday season (December) demand levels are expected to remain higher than the November average (~250) but lower than the Black Friday peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), following the Black Friday spike (P42: 598 units) and the typical early December lull (P43-44: avg 151 units). Historically for denim, we've seen high volatility in late autumn. Period 42 order is expected to arrive in Period 46, and Period 43 order in Period 47. Currently, on-hand is low (256) but pipeline is very high (1772), reflecting large orders placed during the recent volatility. Demand is likely to remain in a 'Holiday' regime, higher than the summer trough but lower than the hyper-peaks. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the shift from the Black Friday peak into the December post-peak period (P41-P44), which averages 285.75 units per week. This approach balances the extreme high of 598 and the lower December observations. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Dec): Period 42-44 average demand is ~300 units/week (despite P43-44 lull), maintaining a significantly higher level than the summer trough (~27) but consolidating from the late-autumn average (~270).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the peak holiday period (week of Christmas). Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has settled post-Black Friday. The Black Friday spike (P42: 598 units) was followed by a typical retail lull in the first two weeks of December (P43: 131, P44: 171, P45: 167). Historically, there is often a secondary peak or stabilization in late December/early January. The demand for the last three periods (P43-P45) averaged ~156 units/week, down from the post-hyper-spike November average of ~250. However, given the product type (skinny denim), demand likely maintains a floor above summer levels (~27). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 274 units on-hand and 1773 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed in P43 and P44 arriving shortly), the primary risk is overstocking as the holiday season concludes. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5, including Black Friday) to capture the current holiday regime while accounting for recent softening. This results in an average weekly demand of approx 247. Standard deviation is also calculated over this period to account for high holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Dec) confirmed: Demand stabilized at ~156 units/week post-Black Friday (P43-P45), down from the late-autumn average of ~250.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, marking the end of the holiday season and the beginning of the post-Christmas/New Year lull. Historical demand patterns for this denim SKU show that demand dramatically drops following peak events (as seen after the Period 33 hyper-spike and the Period 42 Black Friday spike). Recent demand has trended downward from 171 (P44) to 167 (P45) and finally 106 (P46). The average for the last three periods (P44-P46) is ~148, which is consistent with the 'post-holiday' cooling observed in early 2019 data. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this deceleration. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 407 with a massive pipeline of 1534 units (mostly from large orders in P43 and P44 arriving soon). Given the high pipeline and declining seasonal demand, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero or minimal ordering to prevent excessive holding costs during the January low season.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regime (Late Dec): Demand has decreased to an average of ~148 units/week (P44-P46), down from the early-December holiday average of ~300. This confirms a seasonal cooling as the year ends.
