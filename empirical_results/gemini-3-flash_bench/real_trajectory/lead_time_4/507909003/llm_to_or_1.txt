Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1: Initial decision phase for SKU 507909003 (Rebecca or Delphine shirt). Current date is Feb 11, 2019. Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows a mean of 86.2 units and a standard deviation of 12.87. There is no evidence of a demand shift yet, though the late January/early February values are slightly higher than mid-January. Promised lead time is 4. With L=4, the replenishment cycle covers 5 periods of demand. On-hand and pipeline inventory are currently 0. I will use the 'default' method for L (L=4), mu_hat, and sigma_hat to establish a baseline based on all 5 historical samples. This ensures the OR backend uses the promised lead time and historical statistics to calculate the initial base stock and order amount.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's tailored blouse. In Period 1, we experienced a demand of 111 units, which were lost as on-hand inventory was zero. An order of 107 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, this order is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible in Period 6). The historical demand data (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows an average demand of approximately 86.2 units. The Period 1 demand (111) is slightly higher than the historical average, potentially indicating a slight upward trend or seasonality as we move toward spring. For parameters, I will use a recent window of demand samples (N=6, including Period 1) to capture this slight shift. I will stick with the promised lead time (L=4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest deviation. mu_hat will be set to (1+L)*updated_mean and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)*updated_std to ensure the base stock covers the lead time plus the review period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's tailored shirt. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) was approx. 86 units/week. Since Period 1, observed demand has spiked significantly: P1=111, P2=159. This likely reflects the start of the Spring/Pre-Spring retail season for workwear/tailoring. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 223 units in-transit (P1 and P2 orders). With a promised lead time of 4, the P1 order (107 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5, and P2 in Period 6. Because we have zero stock and demand is trending upward, I will use recent_N to capture the higher demand regime. N=2 is the maximum available for the current high-demand period, but I will include the high P2 value in my lookback. I'll set L to default (4). The backend will calculate base_stock to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=2 for demand mean and sigma to capture the current upward momentum and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-January demand shift: Demand increased from an average of 86 (pre-Feb) to 135 (last 2 weeks), likely seasonal for women's tailoring.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand samples from January (avg ~84) were lower than the February values seen in the game history (P1: 111, P2: 159, P3: 126, avg ~132). This confirms the demand regime shift previously identified. The product is a women's blouse, which likely sees a spring seasonal uptick starting in February. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are at Period 4, the first order (placed at Period 1) is not expected to arrive until the resolution phase of Period 5. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 414 units in-transit (orders from P1: 107, P2: 116, P3: 191). The stocking policy should reflect the higher demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the February demand levels (avg ~132, std ~24), and stick with the default promised lead time (L=4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU is a women's tailored blouse. Historical data shows an average demand of ~86 in January, rising to an average of ~122 since mid-February (Periods 1-4). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced 4 consecutive periods of stockouts since the start of the simulation because the promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. There is no evidence yet that the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples (P1-P4 + last historical) average around 116 units, but given the seasonal nature of 'Womens Tailoring' in Spring, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher demand levels compared to early January. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. L remains at the promised value of 4.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's tailored blouse. Historical data shows an average demand of 86.2 in January, which spiked to 135 in early February, and has since moderated slightly in the last three weeks (126, 91, 92) to an average of 103. The promised lead time of 4 periods was confirmed by the arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5. We currently have 15 units on-hand and 528 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Total pipeline is high, so the OR backend will likely throttle ordering. To provide the backend with the most accurate forecast for the (L+1) window, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the post-January elevated mean (approx 115.4 per period) and the corresponding volatility. This covers the shift seen across Feb/March.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-February: After an initial breakout to 159, demand for the last 4 periods has averaged 102 units, establishing a new baseline above the January mean.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Reviewing lead times: Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and Period 2 arrived in Period 6 (L=4), confirming the promised lead time holds. Demand context: After a peak in February (159), demand has stabilized. The last 4 periods (P3-P6) show demands of 126, 91, 92, and 127, averaging ~109 units per period. This aligns with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 6. The product (Womens Tailoring Shirt) likely sees steady demand as we enter Spring. Inventory is very low (4 on-hand), but a large pipeline (502 units) is in transit, with the P3 order (191 units) expected to arrive during this period (visible in P8). I will set L=4 (default), and use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the stabilized post-peak regime while maintaining high service levels to avoid further lost sales.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a 'Gently tailored shirt in a stretch cotton blend', which typically sees consistent demand in spring for professional wear. Historical demand since Period 1 has been: 111, 159, 126, 91, 92, 127, 108. The average demand over these 7 periods is approx 116.3. Looking at the last 4 periods (91, 92, 127, 108), the average is 104.5. The 'Carry-over' already noted a stabilization around 102 units. Actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Total pipeline inventory is 389 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), which covers roughly 3.7 periods of demand at the current average. On-hand is 87 units. To maintain a safety buffer for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1=5), I will use the last 5 periods of demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the post-February stabilization while including some recent volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product (women's tailored shirt) is in a stable demand regime post-February. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 4-8) shows 91, 92, 127, 108, and 130, respectively, resulting in a mean of 109.6. This aligns with the previous insight that demand stabilized around 102-110. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in all concluded shipments (Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Pipeline inventory is healthy at 317 units, and on-hand inventory is 130. To maintain a service level consistent with a profit-to-holding ratio of 4:1 (q=0.8), I will set lead time to 4 (default) and use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the stabilization after the initial February peak. This ensures we cover the L+1 window of ~548 units (109.6 * 5) against our current inventory position (130 + 317 = 447), prompting a replenishment order to meet the forecasted demand.

Carry-over insight: Mid-spring demand stabilization: Weekly demand for Periods 4-8 has stabilized at an average of 110 units (up from 102 previously observed). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's tailored shirt, which typically sees consistent demand in spring. Looking at the history, actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). Demand has transitioned from a high-volatility February (breakout of 159) to a stable mid-spring regime. Since Period 4, demand samples are: 91, 92, 127, 108, 130, 113. The average for these last 6 periods is approximately 110.16. I am using recent_N=6 to capture this stabilized regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The pipeline inventory (405) plus on-hand (65) totals 470 units, which covers roughly 4.2 periods of demand, aligning well with the (L+1) coverage requirement for a 4-period lead time. Parameters are set to maintain this service level while avoiding excess holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand in Period 10 dropped significantly to 63, which contrasts with the previous 5-period average of 114 (Periods 5-9). Given this is a 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt' (Women's Tailoring), demand may be entering a post-Easter/Mid-Spring cooling phase or experiencing a minor fluctuation. All orders from Periods 1 through 6 have arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods, confirming a stable lead time (L=4). Inventory is currently healthy with 92 units on-hand and a large pipeline of 428 units. Because the Period 10 demand drop (63) is a single-point deviation and may not represent a sustained regime shift, I will use recent_N with N=6 for demand and volatility to encompass the mid-spring performance while acknowledging the recent dip. This N=6 covers Period 5 to Period 10, capturing the stabilized average of approximately 105 units. Lead time will remain set to 'calculate' as the 4-period arrival pattern is consistent.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019/4/29). For SKU 507909003 (Womens Tailoring Shirt), demand has shown a noticeable cooling trend over the last two periods (63 and 78 units), compared to the previous average of 110-113 units seen throughout April. This drop likely correlates with the end of the peak spring tailoring season. Historical lead time has remained exceptionally stable at 4 periods. With 92 units on-hand and 405 units in-transit (covering roughly 4-5 periods of demand even at the higher previous mean), we are well-stocked. To prevent over-ordering during this apparent slowdown, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5. This window captures the recent deceleration (averaging 92.4 units over periods 7-11) while still weighting the recent 100+ demand weeks, providing a cautious but responsive forecast. L remains 'default' (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed from Period 10: Late April demand dropped to an average of 70.5 units (Periods 10-11), compared to the previous stable baseline of 110 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-06. The product is a 'Gently tailored shirt' (Womens Tailoring), which typically sees higher demand in early spring and tapers off as summer approaches. We are observing a significant demand regime shift. Historical average was ~110 units (Periods 4-9), but demand for the last 3 periods (10-12) has dropped to 63, 78, and 86 (average 75.7). This confirms the 'deceleration' noted in Period 12 carry-over. I will set N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot to this lower demand level while maintaining the established lead time of 4 periods (consistent arrivals over the last 8 periods). In-transit inventory (351) is high relative to this new demand level (L+1 * 76 = 380), so the capped policy will likely reduce order quantities to prevent excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand dropped from 110 to 76 units over the last 3 periods (Periods 10-12), signaling the end of the spring peak for tailoring.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/05/13). Historical demand analysis confirms a downward shift for this 'Womens Tailoring' item (shirt) following the spring peak. While demand averaged 110 units from early March to mid-April (Periods 4-9), it has averaged 74 units over the last four periods (Periods 10-13: 63, 78, 86, 69). This represents a decrease of approximately 33%. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as seen in the last 9 concluded arrivals. With on-hand inventory at 174 units and a pipeline of 215 units (total 389), we are significantly over-stocked relative to the new demand baseline (~74 * 5 = 370). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent excessive ordering while the on-hand inventory is high.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Tailoring - Gently tailored shirt) has transitioned into a lower-demand regime following the spring peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 10-14) is 75.8 units, significantly lower than the previous mid-spring average of 110 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 204 units, with 103 units still in-transit (ordered Period 11). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high starting inventory and the confirmed deceleration in demand, I am using recent_N (N=5) to align mu_hat and sigma_hat with the current lower demand baseline. This will prevent over-ordering while the system works through the existing stock during this late-spring/early-summer period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for this tailored shirt has shown a recent uptick to 111 (Period 15) after a sustained period of lower demand (average ~75 units for Periods 10-14). This suggests either a late spring rebound or a minor shift in volatility as the season transitions toward summer. The on-hand inventory (148) and in-transit units (139) are relatively healthy. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (P11 order arrived in P15). I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L) to capture the most recent regime shift (N=6, covering the post-April deceleration through the current slight rebound), ensuring the OR engine bases its decisions on the current 70-110 range rather than the higher spring peaks of 130+.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a tailored stretch cotton shirt (Womens Tailoring). Historically, demand for tailoring peaks in spring (March-April) and tends to stabilize or slightly decline in early summer. Observed demand over the last 7 periods (Periods 10-16) has averaged 79 units, confirming the deceleration previously noted in Carry-over Insights (down from the 110-unit spring average). Specifically, demand has fluctuated between 63 and 111, with the most recent observation at 70. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on the most recent five arrivals (Periods 12-16). Given this demand stabilization, I am setting N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this post-peak regime. The pipeline inventory (202 units) and on-hand (125 units) total 327 units, which sufficiently covers the expected demand for the next 5 periods (~5 x 79 = 395). I will use the default lead time method as it is performing accurately.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand regime (June): Demand has stabilized at an average of 79 units (Periods 10-16) following the spring peak. Standard deviation in this regime is approximately 16.5 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand has stabilized into an early summer regime. Since Period 10, the weekly demand mean is approximately 81 units (calculated from Periods 10-17: 63, 78, 86, 69, 83, 111, 70, 73). While Period 15 showed a slight spike (111), the overall pattern is consistent. The promised lead time is 4 periods and the history consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) using recent_N=8 to capture this summer regime (8 * 81 = 648 approx). sigma_hat is also set using the same N to capture the moderate volatility within this stable window.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (mid-June). Demand since Period 10 has stabilized around an average of 79 units, characterizing the early summer demand for tailoring. In Period 18, we observed a stockout (demand 54 vs. 53 available) because the order from Period 13 (scheduled for arrival in Period 17) is missing. The 'In-transit' count of 371 confirms that Period 13's order (136 units) and all subsequent orders are still in the pipeline. Specifically, we expect arrivals from P13 (missing), P15 (91), P16 (110), P17 (103), and P18 (67). Since lead time had been consistent at 4 until the P13 shipment, I will maintain L=4 but monitor for further delays. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=9) to capture the stable regime from Period 10 to Period 18, which aligns with the early summer baseline of ~79 units identified in carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Missing shipment alert: Order from Period 13 (136 units) failed to arrive in Period 17, remains in pipeline. Stockout occurred in Period 18.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand has transitioned into a summer regime, significantly softening from the spring peak. Over the last 10 periods (since Period 10), demand has averaged approximately 72 units. Specifically, the most recent 3 periods show a sharper decline to an average of 53 units, suggesting either a late-seasonal slump or increased volatility. The major concern is the missing Period 13 order (136 units), which should have arrived in Period 17. Because it hasn't Concluded by Period 19, I am treating it as potentially lost or severely delayed. To protect against this gap in the pipeline and the recent stockout in Period 18, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining enough safety stock for volatility. I will keep L at the promised 4 periods for calculation, but the OR backend will naturally increase orders because the pipeline (minus the expected but missing units) is low relative to the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Persistent missing shipment confirmed - Period 13 order (136 units) is now 3 periods overdue (expected P17, now P20). Summer demand regime established (Periods 10-19) with an average of 72 units, notably lower than the spring baseline of 110.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory Status: Entering Period 21 (July 1st) with 141 units on-hand. In-transit pipeline total is 231 units (orders from P17, P18, P19, P20). The missing order from P13 (136 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost; I am excluding it from reliable replenishment planning. Demand Analysis: We are in a summer low for 'Womens Tailoring | Blouses'. Demand has dropped significantly in the last 2 periods (33, 27) vs. the June average of ~70. Setting N=11 for mu_hat (covering Periods 10-20) to reflect the post-spring decline while acknowledging the most recent sharp drop. Lead Time: Observed lead time for successful arrivals (P14, P15, P16) remains 4 periods. Setting explicit Lead Time L=4 to ensure the pipeline covers the next 5 periods of demand. Sigma reflects high recent volatility during the transition to the summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Lost shipment confirmed - Period 13 order is 4 periods overdue and effectively removed from replenishment planning. July entry indicates a deepened summer demand trough (last 2 weeks avg: 30) compared to the June average of 72.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 22 (July 8, 2019). The carry-over insights and recent history confirm a significant demand downturn in July compared to the spring peak (110 units) and even June (72 units). Demand for the last three periods (P19-P21) has been 33, 27, and 39 respectively, averaging approximately 33 units per period. This suggests a deep summer trough for tailored blouses. The lost shipment from Period 13 (136 units) is now fully accounted for as lost, and current on-hand inventory (205) plus in-transit (141) is more than sufficient to cover the current demand regime. With an average demand of ~33, base stock for (L+1=5) periods should be around 165 plus safety stock. Our pipeline inventory (~346) significantly exceeds this, so the OR backend should minimize further ordering. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect this lower July regime (approx 5 * 33 = 165) and leave L at default as lead times for completed deliveries remain consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: July demand trough confirmed: Average demand for Periods 19-21 has dropped to 33 units, representing a >50% decline from the June average of 72.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. We are in a confirmed summer demand trough for 'Womens Tailoring' blouses. Demand over the last 4 periods (P19-P22) has been 33, 27, 39, and 69, averaging 42 units. While P22 saw a slight uptick to 69, the overall trend is significantly lower than the spring baseline of 110. The lost shipment from Period 13 is no longer a factor as on-hand inventory is healthy at 203 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 23 through Period 27. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 samples (N=4) to reflect this lower summer regime while acknowledging the recent slight uptick. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to this recent volatility. The current high on-hand inventory (203) vs the in-transit (74) means the OR backend will likely order 0 or very small amounts, which is appropriate given the holding costs and lower seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime (P19-P22) average stabilizes at 42 units, confirming a deep seasonal trough for tailoring products during peak summer.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-07-22 (late July). We are in a confirmed deep summer demand trough for women's tailored blouses. Historical data from the last 5 periods (P19-P23: 33, 27, 39, 69, 53) shows an average demand of 44.2 units per week, which aligns with the Carry-Over Insights of a seasonal trough (~42 units). On-hand inventory is currently 192 units with 32 units in-transit (ordered P20-P21), while demand is significantly lower than the spring/early summer levels. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are planning for the period ending 5 weeks from now (late August). Women's tailoring often sees a 'Back to Office' or fall transition spike starting in late August. However, current on-hand inventory (192) already covers approximately 4.3 periods of current demand (192 / 44.2). Since the OR backend uses a capped policy (base_stock - pipeline), and our pipeline + on-hand (224 units) is significantly higher than the expected (L+1) demand (approx 5 * 45 = 225), the OR engine will naturally minimize ordering. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized July demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite the historical lost shipment from P13.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt' (Women's Tailoring/Blouses) is currently in a deep summer demand trough. Demand over the last 6 periods (Periods 19-24) has averaged 40.83 units, consistent with the previously identified 'July trough' regime. Specifically, the last three weeks of demand were 69, 53, and 24. We are currently sitting on significant inventory (on-hand 187) which is nearly 5 times the recent weekly average demand. With a lead time of 4 periods (L+1=5), our inventory position (on-hand + in-transit = 187 + 42 = 229) already covers approximately 5.6 periods of demand at the current average rate. Therefore, we should aim for a protective but lean base stock. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain L at 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods since the clear loss of the Period 13 order.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). Historical analysis shows a significant seasonal decline for 'Womens Tailoring' starting in mid-April and deepening into a July trough. Demand over the last 7 periods (P19-P25) has averaged 42.14 units, confirming a stable low-demand summer regime. On-hand inventory is currently high at 150 units, which covers approximately 3.5 weeks of current demand. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to maintain coverage for roughly 5 periods (L+1). Total pipeline (On-hand 150 + In-transit 37 = 187) provides over 4 weeks of coverage at the current mean. As we move into August, we should remain cautious of high holding costs while monitoring for any early Autumn collection pickup. I will use a recent_N of 7 to capture the established summer baseline for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the promised lead time of 4 as actual deliveries (excluding the lost P13 order) have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (July-August) stabilized at an average of 42 units (Periods 19-25). Pipeline reliability has returned to the promised 4-period lead time following the recovery from the Period 13 lost shipment.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand in Period 26 spiked to 76 units, which is significantly higher than the previous July-August regime average of 42 units (established in Periods 19-25). This aligns with a potential 'Back to Business/Back to School' transition for tailored garments as summer concludes. Historical data from early February (another business transition period) saw demands exceeding 100 units. To avoid a stockout during this transition, I am shifting the forecasting window to capture this emerging upward trend. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to weigh the recent demand increase (avg of Periods 23-26 is ~51) while balancing against the deeper trough. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-business demand transition: Period 26 demand (76) suggests an exit from the summer trough (avg 42) for tailoring products.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal shift: Period 26 demand was 76 and Period 27 demand was 136, confirming an exit from the July-August summer trough (average 42) into a 'back-to-business' or late summer peak for women's tailoring. The stockout in Period 27 (sold 74 out of 136 demand) signals urgent replenishment needs. Lead time has returned to the promised 4 periods following the Period 13 loss. To address the sharp demand increase, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (Periods 25-27) to capture this upward momentum (avg approx 87 units/period, or 435 for lead+review). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this transition. L is set to default (4) as recent arrivals have been consistent with promised times.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-business demand surge confirmed: Demand increased from summer trough (avg 42) to an average of 106 units over the last 2 periods (P26-P27), indicating the start of a late-summer/fall regime for tailoring.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/26. We are in a 'Back-to-business' demand surge for women's tailoring, confirmed by a significant increase in demand over the last 3 periods (P26-P28 demand: 76, 136, 85), moving away from the summer trough (avg 42). The average demand over the last 3 periods is ~99 units. We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) because the pipeline was lean during the transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P24 order in P28. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this new demand level (approx 100/wk) to ensure the OR backend orders enough to satisfy the (L+1) window, using N=3 for recent demand reflecting the new regime. Sigma_hat is calculated manually based on these recent samples to account for the volatility seen during the surge (76, 136, 85). pipeline_inventory (305) is monitored, but since on-hand is zero, we need aggressive replenishment to meet the fall peak.

Carry-over insight: Fall 'Back-to-business' regime confirmed: Demand for Periods 26-28 averaged 99 units (76, 136, 85), up from the summer trough of 42 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909003 (Women's Blouse) is clearly in a 'Back-to-Business' fall demand regime as of early September. Demand over the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 76, 136, 85, and 87, averaging approximately 96 units per week. This is a significant increase from the summer trough average of 42. Since Period 27/28, we have been stocking out (on-hand is currently 0) because the summer orders were based on lower volume. We have a pipeline of 450 units, but 313 of those were ordered very recently (P28 & P29) and won't arrive for another 3-4 periods. Lead time has returned to the promised 4 periods (P24 and P25 orders arrived exactly at L=4). To capture the new demand regime while managing the stockout recovery, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the ~96 unit average. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen during the regime shift (e.g., the 136 spike in P27). L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have normalized.

Carry-over insight: Fall 'Back-to-business' regime firmly established: Average demand for P26-P29 is 96 units, more than double the summer trough (42 units). Supply chain reliability confirmed at L=4.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in the 'Back-to-business' fall regime for women's tailoring (blouses). Demand spiked to 164 in Period 30, bringing the average for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) to 109.6 units, significantly higher than the summer average of 42. On-hand inventory is effectively zero due to this surge exceeding recent arrivals. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P26 order arrived in P30). The pipeline (477 units) appears large, but it must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of elevated demand. Given the sharp increase to 164, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this fall regime (average ~110), but I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=20) to ensure the OR engine provides enough safety stock to handle the high volatility (76 to 164 range) seen during this transition. This balances the high service level required by the 4:1 profit/holding ratio against the risk of further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Fall 'Back-to-business' regime demand surge confirmed: Period 30 demand reached 164; the 5-period average (P26-P30) is 110 units, establishing a new high-demand regime for the fall season.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909003 (Womens Tailoring Shirt) is currently in a high-demand fall 'Back-to-business' regime. Demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) has averaged 107.8 units (76, 136, 85, 87, 164, 99), with a noticeable peak of 164 in P30. This is a dramatic increase from the summer trough of ~40 units. We are currently facing on-hand stockouts (ending inventory 0 for 5 consecutive periods) due to this surge exceeding summer-weighted forecasts. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am setting L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current fall regime (P26-P31), resulting in a forecast of (1+4)*~108 = 540. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=6 to capture the increased volatility (Std Dev ~34) seen since the end of July, ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to recover from the current stockout and meet the seasonal demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The fall 'Back-to-business' regime initiated at Period 26 is firmly established. Over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), demand has averaged 105.8 units (76, 136, 85, 87, 164, 99, 94), significantly higher than the summer trough of 42. Recent data shows high volatility (std dev ~32), which requires a robust safety stock. Supply chain reliability has stabilized with a lead time of 4 periods observed consistently in recent concluded messages (P30, P31, P32). Pipeline inventory is high (445 units) due to aggressive ordering in the preceding periods to recover from stockouts. The current on-hand inventory of 66 units, combined with the large in-transit volume, should be sufficient to meet demand through the lead time, but we must maintain parameters that reflect the current high-demand regime to ensure the capped policy doesn't under-order if demand spikes further.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime established (P26-P32): Average demand is 106 units, reflecting a post-summer recovery for women's tailoring products.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The fall 'Back-to-business' regime is firmly established (late Sept/Oct). Demand has remained high, with the last 8-period average (P26-P33) around 101 units, though volatility is high (P30: 164, P33: 168). Current on-hand inventory is 51 units. Pipeline inventory (371 units) is robust, reflecting large orders placed during the surge. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand spikes recently observed, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (regime length P26-P33, N=8) to capture the current fall baseline (avg ~101). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to account for the increased volatility seen in the 160+ demand spikes. This set of parameters ensures the base-stock target (L+1 periods) is high enough to handle these late-season peaks while account for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime demand peaks: Demand spikes of 160+ (P30, P33) confirmed within the current regime (P26-P33 avg: 101), indicating high volatility in the tailoring category during peak autumn.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507909003' (Womens Tailoring Shirt) is currently in a high-demand fall regime that began in Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand has averaged approximately 110 units (P26-P34: 76, 136, 85, 87, 164, 99, 94, 168, 83). While there is significant volatility (peaks over 160), the average is stable. Lead time has normalized at 4 periods post-recovery from the lost Period 13 shipment. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%, which the OR backend will calculate. Given the recent consistency of the fall regime, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the statistics of this specific seasonal window (P26-P34). mu_hat will be estimated as (1+L) * ~110. Lead time remains 'default' (4) as confirmed by recent 'conclude' messages.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507909003' (Womens Tailoring) is currently in its peak fall 'back-to-business' season. Demand has shifted from a summer trough of 42 to a sustained autumn average of approximately 110 units (P26-P35 mean is 109.6). Although individual weeks fluctuate (83 to 168), the trend is strong and consistent with October retail patterns for professional attire. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. With 83 units on hand and 433 in transit, the pipeline is relatively healthy, but significant incoming demand necessitates maintaining a high service level. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this entire fall regime starting from Period 26. This allows the OR engine to react to the increased mean and the heightened volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 34) observed during this peak season while ignoring the significantly lower summer data.

Carry-over insight: Fall 'Back-to-business' regime (P26-P35) stabilized: Mean demand is ~110 units with a standard deviation of ~34, significantly higher and more volatile than the summer trough (avg 42).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand fall regime (Back-to-business/Autumn seasonality). Over the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 107 units per week, with significant volatility (highs of 164-168, lows of 74). The most recent period (P36) showed a demand of 74, but given the tailoring category's tendency for autumn spikes, we must maintain a robust stock level. Lead time has returned to a dependable 4 periods since the recovery from the Period 13 lost shipment. To capture the current regime's characteristics, I am using recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This N-value covers the entirety of the post-summer recovery and provides a stable representation of both the higher mean and the increased volatility observed in the fall. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand at the optimal service level (q=0.8).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the fall 'Back-to-business' regime for women's tailoring (shirts/blouses). Recent demand data (P34-P37: 83, 103, 74, 47) shows a softening trend from the peak seen in P33 (168). Specifically, the average demand of the last 4 periods is 76.75 units, compared to the previously established regime mean of ~110. This suggests we are moving past the main autumn peak into a late-fall stabilization or early-winter transition. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility in this SKU (std dev ~34), I will use a recent_N window for both mean and volatility to capture this shift. The window N=7 (P31-P37) encompasses the core of the post-peak period and the recent drop, providing a mean (168, 83, 103, 74, 47 are recent; P31-P33 were 99, 94, 168) that balances the recent slowing with the high-demand context. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late fall demand deceleration: Demand mean has shifted from ~110 (P26-P33) to ~77 in the most recent 4 periods (P34-P37), indicating a post-peak tailoring seasonal trend.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-04. We are observing a significant late-fall demand deceleration for the tailoring category (SKU 507909003). Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 71.2 units (83, 103, 74, 47, 49), which is a clear shift from the previous 'Back-to-business' regime (P26-P33) that averaged 106 units. The most recent two periods (47 and 49) suggest this trough is deepening. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 241 units on-hand and 259 in-transit, the pipeline is very heavy relative to current demand trends. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the deceleration phase) to reflect the new average of ~71 units per period, and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture current volatility. The OR backend should reduce order quantities to prevent excessive holding costs during this seasonal slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Late fall demand deceleration confirmed (Periods 34-38): Average demand dropped from ~110 units to ~71 units (-35%), signaling the end of the fall peak for women's tailoring.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a late-fall demand deceleration phase for women's tailoring products (blouses), which follows the post-summer 'back-to-business' peak. Recent demand for Periods 34-39 has been significantly lower than the fall peak, with an average of approximately 68 units (83, 103, 74, 47, 49, 52). Specifically, the last four periods (P36-P39) averaged only 55.5 units, confirming a sustained downtrend as winter approaches. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (294) plus in-transit stock (154) totals 448 units, which is quite high relative to the slowing demand. To prevent excessive holding costs during this trough, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the recent deceleration (avg ~68) while acknowledging the volatility observed earlier in the season. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 6 periods to reflect current fluctuation levels. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR engine due to the high existing inventory and lowering base stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Late fall/Early winter trough confirmed (Nov): Demand for Periods 37-39 has dropped to an average of 49 units, a ~55% decrease from the fall regime (avg 110). Inventory should be managed for lower seasonal throughput.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for tailoring products has entered a late fall/early winter trough as of early November. Demand for the last four periods (P37-P40) has been 47, 49, 52, and 44, averaging approximately 48 units per period. This is a significant decrease from the autumn peak of ~110. Currently, on-hand inventory is 346 units with 58 units in-transit (ordered P37). Given the current demand (avg ~48), the existing on-hand stock covers approximately 7 periods, which exceeds the review + lead time window (1 + 4 = 5). No new orders are needed. Parameters L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are adjusted using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation aligns with the current seasonal trough to avoid further overstocking and minimize holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-25. The tailoring category has entered a seasonal trough as evidenced by demand in the last 5 periods (P37-P41) averaging 49.8 units, a significant drop from the fall peak (avg 110). On-hand inventory is currently 347 units with 0 in-transit. Based on the current demand rate (~50 units/period) and L=4, the pipeline target (L+1) is approximately 250 units. Since 347 exceeds this target, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent low-demand regime using the last 5 samples to prevent over-ordering during the winter slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Winter seasonal trough confirmed: Demand for Periods 37-41 has stabilized at an average of 49.8 units, down from the fall peak of 110 units (-55%).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Recent demand history indicates a winter seasonal trough, with an average demand of approximately 50 units (Periods 37-41). Although Period 42 showed a spike to 141 units, this is likely a temporary peak related to late November sales events (e.g., Black Friday/Cyber Monday) rather than a sustained regime shift. The carry-over insights confirm a sustained drop from the fall peak (110 units) to a winter baseline of ~50 units. With 206 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we have over 4 periods of supply even at the slightly higher average of 49.8. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (including the spike) to remain cautious but avoid over-ordering during a low-demand season. The OR backend will likely recommend a zero order given the high current inventory relative to the winter demand baseline.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 141 in Period 42 aligns with late November retail events; however, the broad winter regime (Periods 37-41) remains at a significantly lower average of ~50 units compared to the fall peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the mid-December period (Period 44). Historical demand patterns and Carry-over Insights indicate a settled winter trough for women's tailoring, typically averaging around 50 units (Periods 37-41 avg: 49.8). The spike in Period 42 (141 units) is attributed to late November retail events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) and has already subsided in Period 43 (52 units). On-hand inventory is currently 154 units with 127 units in-transit (ordered Period 43). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high starting inventory relative to the winter demand mean (~50/week), the primary goal is to maintain a lean stock level to minimize holding costs while covering the lead time window. I will set mu_hat based on the recent winter regime (last 7 periods, including the spike, to be safe: P37-P43 avg = 63). This provides enough buffer for standard winter demand without over-ordering during the seasonal dip.

Carry-over insight: Mid-December demand remains in the winter trough regime; the late November spike (Period 42) was transient and has subsided as of Period 43.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a winter low-demand regime for women's tailoring, which stabilized after the late fall peak. Excluding the transient Black Friday spike in Period 42 (141 units), recent demand (Periods 37-44) has averaged approximately 50.4 units. I will use a the mean of the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this lower seasonal baseline while acknowledging the volatility observed throughout the year. The lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 102 units, and the pipeline contains 227 units from orders placed in Periods 43 and 44. Since we are approaching the final 3 periods of the simulation (closing at Period 47), parameters are set to maintain coverage for the remaining duration without overstocking, as holding costs would impact the final total reward.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. The product (women's tailoring) is in a stable winter trough following a brief transient spike in late November (Period 42). Demand for the last three periods (P43-P45) has been consistent at 52, 52, and 50 units, respectively. This confirms the 'Winter seasonal trough' regime identified in carry-over insights, with a mean near 50-55 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the consistent arrival schedule prior to recent zero-ordering periods). The backend OR engine needs to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at this lower consumption rate. I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=9 (covering the regime start from Period 37, excluding the Period 42 spike outlier) to avoid over-ordering based on the volatile fall history. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect the lower volatility in this winter regime compared to the autumn peaks.

Carry-over insight: Winter trough demand (P37-P45) confirmed stable at ~52 units (excluding P42 transience). Standard deviation has decreased significantly from the fall regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the final week of December (Date: 2019/12/30). The demand for 'Womens Tailoring' has been in a sustained winter trough since Period 37, averaging approximately 52 units per week (excluding a transient Black Friday/Cyber Monday spike in Period 42). Period 46 demand was consistent at 52 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a significant pipeline of 308 units. The first of these orders (127 units from Period 43 with L=4) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 47) and will be visible in the next observation. Given the seasonality of tailoring shirts, we anticipate demand will likely remain at the winter baseline of ~50-60 units before any potential early spring recovery in February. I will continue using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10, covering the stable winter regime) and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at L=4 based on historical performance.
