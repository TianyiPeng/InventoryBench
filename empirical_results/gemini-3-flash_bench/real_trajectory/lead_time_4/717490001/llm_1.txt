  "rationale": "This is Period 1. The product is a basic jersey cat T-shirt (Divided Basics), which typically shows stable demand but can be influenced by general retail seasonality. Historical data (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows demand ranging from 53 to 100, with a downward trend from the initial post-holiday peak (100 -> 66 -> 70 -> 62 -> 53). The average demand over these 5 weeks is approx 70 units/period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. To cover the lead-time window plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods), I need to account for demand in Periods 1 through 5. Based on the recent average of 70, the pipeline requirement is roughly 350 units. While demand has been trending down to the 50s, I will order 320 to initiate the pipeline, balancing the recent lower volume with the need to establish a safety stock given the 4-period lead time.",

Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) showed an average of 70.2 units per week, with a slightly declining trend into early February. However, Period 1 (Feb 11) recorded a demand of 41 units, which is significantly lower than the historical average, likely due to seasonal transition or post-holiday lull.

Using a conservative forecast of ~50 units/week (given the recent drop), total pipeline requirement is ~250 units. Since 320 units are already in-transit, I have sufficient pipeline to cover the lead time gap and rebuild safety stock once they arrive. However, I am currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and will remain so for several periods until the first shipment arrives. I will not place an additional order this period to avoid overstocking and high holding costs in the long run, as the existing in-transit quantity exceeds the 5-period demand estimate.",

Recent demand data (Periods 23-28) shows a generally declining regime (~57-87 units), with a significant outlier in Period 28 (178 units), likely due to a 'Back to School' peak or a clearance spike. Despite the spike, the overall trend for basic short-sleeve jersey tops in late August is downward. Inventory management currently shows a high on-hand balance of 437 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, I need enough stock to cover Periods 29 through 33. Total demand for 5 periods, if averaged at ~100 units (accounting for the spike), would be 500.

Given the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 46, just before the game ends in Period 47. We need to cover demand for Periods 42-46. Current pipeline: On-hand (59) + In-transit (700). The in-transit units are scheduled as follows: P38 (100) arrives P42; P39 (200) arrives P43; P40 (250) arrives P44; P41 (150) arrives P45. The total inventory currently committed to the pipeline covers expected holiday demand (estimated at 150-200 units per period) through the end of the game. Specifically, the P42 arrival (100) + on-hand (59) will likely just meet P42 demand. The large arrivals in P43-P45 will buffer against late December peaks. I will place a final order of 100 units to ensure no stock-outs occur in the very final period (P47), while avoiding excessive holding costs as the game concludes.",

  "rationale": "The product is a 'Cat Tee' (Jersey Basic T-shirt), which experiences seasonal fluctuations. We are currently in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). Historically, demand has been climbing through Q4 (Period 40: 121, Period 41: 141, Period 42: 174). With the Christmas holiday and end-of-year shopping approaching in the next 3-4 periods, demand is expected to remain high or increase further before the game ends at Period 47. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Orders placed today (P43) will arrive in Period 47, which is the final period of the game. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit pipeline includes: 200 (from P39, expected P43 arrival resolution), 250 (from P40, expected P44), 150 (from P41, expected P45), 100 (from P42, expected P46). Total pipeline for the remaining 5 periods (43-47) is 700 units. Expected demand for Periods 43-46 (the periods before today's order arrives) is approximately 180-220 units per period. 700 units over 4 periods is 175/period, which might be slightly short given the upward trend. Ordering 100 units now will cover potential demand spikes in the final period (P47) while accounting for the fact that terminal inventory has no value beyond the profit/holding calculation at P47.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a 'Cat Tee' (basic jersey t-shirt). Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand shows a typical Q4 pattern: a steady climb through November (averaging ~145 units from P40-P42), followed by a sharp drop in P43 (42 units) which suggests a temporary post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday lull before the final pre-Christmas push. Based on early-game data and seasonal trends, I expect a moderate recovery in demand for the next 2 weeks (P44-P45) as shoppers finish holiday purchasing, followed by the end-of-year clearance or post-holiday drop in P46-P47. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Orders placed now (P44) will arrive in P48, which is after the game ends (P47). Therefore, any order placed now will only incur holding costs if it arrived, and since it arrives at P48, it will not contribute to units sold or ending inventory during the game's duration. However, I have a significant pipeline: 250 units (ordered P40) arriving P44, 150 units (ordered P41) arriving P45, 100 units (ordered P42) arriving P46, and 100 units (ordered P43) arriving P47. Total inventory available to cover demand until P47 is 158 (on-hand) + 600 (in-transit) = 758 units. Over the remaining 4 periods, even at a high average demand of 150 units, I only need ~600 units. My current pipeline already exceeds expected demand. To maximize profit and minimize holding costs at the game's end, no further orders are needed.",

Our goal is to maximize profit from the inventory already on hand or due to arrive before Period 47. Currently, we have 369 units on-hand and 350 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory consists of: P41 (150 units, arriving P45), P42 (100 units, arriving P46), and P43 (100 units, arriving P47). Total inventory available for the remaining three periods (P45, P46, P47) is $369 + 150 + 100 + 100 = 719$ units. Recent demand has fallen sharply (average 40.5 over P43-P44) following a December 2nd peak, likely indicating the end of the holiday shopping surge for this basic jersey t-shirt. Even if demand returns to the November average of ~140, we have ample stock to cover the remaining periods. Adding more inventory through a new order would only incur holding costs or remains as ending inventory with no opportunity for sale. Therefore, the optimal action is to order 0 units.",
