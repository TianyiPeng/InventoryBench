Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'Ankle-length jeans in washed stretch denim', a staple ladies' denim item. Historical demand shows a significant jump in the most recent week (2019-02-04: 354) compared to the previous four weeks (avg ~253). This suggests a potential upward trend or a February seasonal shift. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and starting from 0 inventory, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5 periods). Using the last 5 samples for mean demand gives an average of 273.2. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent volume while acknowledging the latest spike. For sigma_hat, N=5 accounts for the recent volatility. L will be default (4) as no actual lead time data is yet available.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is Ladies Denim (Ankle-length jeans). Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: January mean was ~253, but Feb 04 leaped to 354, and Period 1 (Feb 11) hit 414. This suggests a seasonal 'Spring' ramp-up. On-hand is currently 0 because the first order (350 units) was just placed in Period 1 and the promised lead time is 4 periods. Since demand is currently 414 but we only had 354 as the last known pre-game data point, the OR backend needs a higher mu_hat to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture this recent spike (354 and 414) while ignoring the lower January values. L is kept at 'default' (4) as we have no data to suggest a lead time shift yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is Ladies' skinny ankle denim. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) showed a mean of ~273 units. However, observed demand in P1 (414) and P2 (399) shows a significant upward shift, likely due to spring seasonality for ankle-length denim. The promised lead time is 4 periods, so orders placed in P1 and P2 are not expected until P5 and P6 respectively. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts because the initial system state did not have enough stock to cover the lead time. Given the clear demand regime shift starting around early February (354 units on Feb 4th, then >390 in P1-P2), I will use the recent_N method to capture this higher demand level (N=3 to include the 354, 414, and 399 samples). I will stick to the promised lead time for now until observations prove otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-04: Average increased from ~250 to ~390 (+56%) as spring season begins for ladies denim.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' (Ladies Denim) is likely entering a spring seasonal peak. Historical demand samples showed ~250 units/week, but recent observed demand (Periods 1-3) has jumped to an average of 378 units/week. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started at Period 1, no orders have arrived yet (first arrival expected Period 5 if L=4). Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 1257 units (sum of orders from P1, P2, P3). To ensure we cover demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), and accounting for the recent regime shift, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and volatility calculation to reflect the higher spring demand level (~380/week). I will maintain the default promised lead time of 4 until arrival data proves otherwise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is 'Ladies Denim/Trousers', which typically sees strong spring demand. Looking at historical arrivals: promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 (placed at the start of P1) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (P1+4=5). We will only see this arrival confirmed in the Period 6 start message. Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced 4 periods of lost sales due to zero stock. The demand samples show a high of 414 and 399 in P1/P2, dropping to 321 and 247 in P3/P4. The average demand across these 4 periods is ~345. Given the spring seasonality for denim, I expect demand to remain elevated but potentially stabilize after the initial February surge. The pipeline (in-transit) of 1718 units covers approximately 5 periods of forecasted demand at the 345 rate. Using 'recent_N' with N=4 captures this post-regime-shift behavior while smoothing out the recent dip.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is ladies' denim jeans, which saw a demand spike in early February (approx. 400 units/week), but demand has moderated in the last three weeks (P3: 321, P4: 247, P5: 245). Period 1's order arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 4 periods (arrived P5). We have heavy 'in-transit' inventory (1522 units) from orders in P2-P5, which should begin arriving in P6 and P7. The current on-hand inventory is 105. Given the recent stabilization of demand around 246 units/week over the last two periods, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (P3-P5) to reflect this cooling trend while maintaining a buffer for the earlier spike. L is set to 'calculate' as the first lead time observation matched the promised 4 periods. sigma_hat will use the last 3 samples to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderated from the Feb peak of ~400 to ~246 (+/- 1) over the last two periods (P4-P5); Lead time confirmed at 4 periods from P1 order arrival.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019-04-01). Reviewing the history, the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, and 7 conclusions). Demand for this ladies' denim SKU has shifted: an initial spike in Feb reached ~400, followed by a moderation phase in March (~245-265), and now an uptick in the most recent period (Period 7) to 331 units. This upward movement aligns with the early spring/April shopping season. With on-hand inventory at 416 and 856 units in transit, we are well-stocked, but must account for the increasing trend. I will use a 3-period window (recent_N=3) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent upward trend (averaging ~280 units/period) without being overly reactive to the highest peak. Since variance has stabilized after the initial shift, recent_N=3 for sigma_hat is also appropriate to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains at the default promised/observed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend reversal: After moderating to ~250 in early March, demand rose to 331 at Period 7 (start of April), signaling potential mid-spring seasonality.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product (Ladies Ankle Denim) is in the middle of the spring season. Historical demand has fluctuated significantly: a peak in early February (~400), a dip in mid-March (~245), and a recent rise in early April (331 in Period 7, though Period 8 softened to 283). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the conclusion of orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. Currently, we have 594 units on hand and 610 in-transit (orders from P5, P7, and P8; the P5 order of 154 units is expected to arrive during this period). Total pipeline inventory is 1204 units. Given the seasonality, demand is expected to remain around the 300-330 range. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the demand stabilization and increase following the March dip. This N=4 window covers the Period 5-8 regime where demand averaged ~281, while acknowledging the potential for higher spring demand peaks.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we observe significant demand volatility for Ladies Denim. Demand peaked in February (~400), moderated in early March (~250), spiked at the start of April (331), and has now dropped to 201. This suggests a post-Easter or mid-spring lull. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by all historical arrivals (P1-P5 orders all arrived with L=4). Pipeline inventory (727) plus current on-hand (547) equals 1274 units, which is ample coverage for the current demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the recent volatility (265, 331, 283, 201) which averages ~270 per period, helping the OR engine adjust down from the higher historical averages and avoid excessive holding costs in a declining demand phase.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), we observe a significant downward trend in demand for this Ladies Denim SKU. Demand has dropped consistently from 331 in P7 to 130 in P10. This aligns with late spring where sales for specific heavy-wash denim styles often dip before early summer peaks. Period 10's order (ordered Period 6) did not arrive, but history shows a consistent 4-period lead time, meaning the P6 order (which was 0 units) resulted in the 'arrived=0' status. On-hand inventory (417) plus in-transit stock (905) is very high relative to current demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (last three samples: 283, 201, 130) to capture this cooling trend and prevent over-ordering while maintaining a buffer against volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: End-of-season cooling detected; weekly demand dropped from ~280-330 in early April to 130 by mid-April.

=== Period 11 Summary ===
399256001: ordered=0, arrived=241 units (ordered on Period 7, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=658, demand=173, sold=173, ending on-hand inventory=485

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29th, 2019. We are seeing a sustained drop in demand for this Ladies Denim SKU, likely due to end-of-season clearance or transitioning styles (April demand: 331 -> 283 -> 201 -> 130 -> 173). The average demand over the last 3 periods is ~168, significantly lower than the early spring peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 485 units on-hand and 664 units in-transit (total pipeline of 1,149), and a current consumption rate of ~170/week, we have approximately 6-7 weeks of supply. Given the holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit, and demand is cooling, we need to lower the base stock to avoid excessive stock-outs of capital into holding costs. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime. Note: The order from Period 6 appears to be missing/lost as it should have arrived in Period 10; however, the pipeline remains very high relative to current demand trends.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Demand cooled significantly in April, averaging ~168 over the last 3 weeks compared to ~280+ previously; Period 6 order (ordered P6, expected P10) is likely lost as P7 order arrived in P11.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256001' (Brooklyn Ladies Denim) is in a post-peak spring cooling phase. Demand in April (Periods 10-12) has averaged ~177 units, a significant drop from the 300+ observed in February/March. Period 12 demand was 227, which is a slight uptick but still within the lower regime. On-hand inventory (473) plus current in-transit (449) equals 922 units, which covers over 5 periods of demand at the current rate (177 * 5 = 885). The shipment ordered in Period 6 is confirmed lost (as Period 7 and 8 have arrived), which simplifies the pipeline calculation. I am setting L to explicit 4 to match the reliable observed lead time. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=3 to capture the lower late-spring demand regime (Periods 10-12), and sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the current volatility. This configuration ensures we don't over-order into a cooling season while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the 227 unit variance observed in Period 12.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late spring (Period 10-12) at an average of ~177 units/week, down from late March peak levels. Period 6 order is definitively lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $371.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the item (Ladies Denim) shows demand stability over the last three weeks with an average of approximately 208 units (223, 227, 173). The early spring peak (300+) has clearly subsided. The Period 6 order is confirmed lost (skipped over by Period 7, 8, and 9 arrivals). On-hand inventory is currently high (521 units), with an additional 231 units in transit (from Periods 10 and 13). Given the current holding cost burden and the cooling demand, the objective is to allow on-hand stock to deplete. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (approx 188 units/week) to reflect the late-spring demand level, and keep L at the promised 4 periods as actual lead times remain consistent for surviving orders.

Carry-over insight: Late-spring demand stabilized: Period 10-13 average is 188 units/week, significantly lower than the Feb/March peaks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for successful shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for ladies denim (Skinny Ankle jeans) has stabilized following an end-of-season cooling period in April. Over the last four periods (P11-P14), demand has averaged 218.5 units/week (173, 227, 223, 251), showing a slight recovery from the early April lows but remaining well below early spring peaks. The order from Period 6 remains lost. Lead time for all other recent shipments (P7, P8, P9, P10) is confirmed at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (448) plus in-transit stock (317, consisting of orders from P13 and P14) is 765 units. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (approx. 1092 units). I will use recent_N=4 to capture the stabilized late-spring demand pattern for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, helping the OR engine maintain a sufficient base stock to cover the L+1 period window while accounting for recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Late-spring demand regime (May) has stabilized at an average of ~219 units/week (P11-P14), which is higher than the April cooling period (~168) but lower than the Feb/March peaks (~350+).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/27. Demand has shown a moderate recovery in May, moving from the late-April lows (~170) to an average of 241 units over the last three weeks (P13-P15: 223, 251, 267). This suggests a stabilized late-spring/early-summer demand regime. On lead times: the Period 6 order is confirmed lost (skipped over by P7-P10 arrivals). The Period 11 and 12 orders were '0', so 'arrived=0' in the Period 15 conclusion for the P11 order (lead_time 4) is expected. The pipeline now contains orders from P13 (53), P14 (264), and P15 (273). Given the consistent 4-period lead time for successful deliveries, I will set L to 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent upward drift in demand (241 units/week), as the full-history mean is skewed by very high early-season peaks and very low mid-season troughs.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime (P13-P15) stabilized at higher levels than April (avg ~241 vs ~170).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. The demand regime for May (P13-P16) has been consistently higher than April, averaging approximately 241 units/week. Most recently, P16 demand was 223 units, however, the system stocked out (ending inventory 0, sold 181), likely resulting in lost sales. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 874 units, but significant arrivals are expected soon (P13 order of 53 units and P14 order of 264 units). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the reliable average for successful shipments. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P13-P16) to capture the stabilized May demand levels (avg ~241), ensuring the OR engine maintains a base stock level that covers this higher-than-April volume across the lead time plus review period (5 weeks total). This will help recover from the current stock-out while managing holding costs as summer approaches.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) due to a surge in demand in May and early June coupled with the loss of the Period 6 order and several zero-arrival periods (P15-P16). The Period 13 order arrived in P17 (Lead time 4). Looking ahead to Period 18, we are in June. Historically, demand has fluctuated: a late spring peak in May (~247 avg) followed by a slight cooling to 160 in Period 17 (June start). I expect June demand to remain around the 200-220 range based on the 'Ladies Denim' category's transition into summer. To recover from the stockout and manage the pipeline, I will focus on the most recent 4-week demand trend (P14-P17 avg = 225 units) to capture the current regime while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand at this rate.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred in Periods 16-17 due to pipeline gaps and the previously confirmed loss of the Period 6 shipment; demand in early June (P17) showed a sharp decrease to 160 from the May average of ~240.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (mid-June): Demand has trended downwards from a May average of ~247 (P13-P15) to a June average of ~150 (P17-P18), indicating a summer season shift for these skinny ankle jeans. On-hand inventory is low (124) due to recent stockouts caused by a lost Period 6 shipment and a pipeline gap in mid-May (P11-P12 had zero orders). However, a large in-transit volume (951) is coming, including expected deliveries from orders placed in P15, P16, and P17. Lead time is consistently 4 periods for successful shipments. I will set the demand forecast based on the most recent regime (P17-P18) to avoid over-ordering as we enter summer, setting N=3 for mu_hat (covering the drop from 240+ to ~150). This allows the OR backend to replenish based on current demand levels while considering the massive incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime shift detected in June: Weekly demand dropped from a May average of ~247 to a June average of ~150 (P17-P18), a roughly 40% decrease.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Demand analysis indicates a significant summer cooling trend in June: demand for the last three periods (P17-P19) has been 160, 140, and 113, averaging approximately 138 units/week. This follows the May average of ~247, representing a drop of over 40%. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods for successful deliveries. Currently, on-hand inventory is 284 and in-transit is 678, totaling 962 units. With demand averaging ~138, the pipeline covers approximately 7 weeks of demand, which is sufficient given the 4-period lead time. To align the OR backend with this lower regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the recent summer stabilization, and sigma_hat using the same window to capture recent volatility. L is kept at 'default' (4) as lead times are currently stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: June demand confirmed at an average of ~138 units/week (P17-P19), down from May's ~247 (-44%), reflecting summer seasonality for ladies denim trousers.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are entering the mid-summer demand regime for ladies skinny ankle jeans. Historical demand over the last 4 periods (P17-P20) shows a steady decline: 160, 140, 113, and 70. The average for this regime is approximately 120 units/week, significantly lower than the May average of ~247. On-hand inventory is healthy at 498 units, and with 394 units in-transit (Period 17 and 18 orders), we are well-covered for the (L+1) horizon. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp drop to 70 units in Period 20, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect this low-demand summer phase and avoid over-ordering, while keeping sigma_hat reflective of recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: July demand continues to decline, hitting 70 units in P20. Cumulative June/July average (P17-P20) is ~120 units/week, a -51% drop from May levels.

Analyzing the demand history, there is a clear downward trend consistent with summer seasonality for denim: P17 (160), P18 (140), P19 (113), P20 (70), and P21 (99). The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 116 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high at 676 units, and there are 117 units in-transit (from the P18 order, expected to arrive in P22). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given that on-hand inventory + pipeline (676 + 117 = 793) already covers over 6 weeks of current demand (793 / 116 \u2248 6.8), and the OR backend uses a base stock policy of (L+1) periods (which is 5 periods), the system is currently overstocked relative to the decelerating summer demand. To minimize holding costs while the backend drains excess inventory, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (last 5 periods) and keep lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: July demand confirmed to be in a low-season trough: Average demand for P17-P21 is ~116 units/week, down from May's high-200s.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256001' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a low-demand summer trough in mid-July. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P17-P22) is approximately 123 units/week. On-hand inventory is high at 638 units, and there is no inventory in-transit (pipeline). With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a calculation window of L+1 = 5 periods, the total projected demand for the look-ahead period is roughly 615 units (123 * 5). Since on-hand inventory (638) already slightly exceeds this projected demand and demand has been consistently low, there is no immediate need to order additional stock. The parameters are set using recent data (N=6) to reflect the summer demand regime and stabilize inventory until the autumn season transition begins.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a mid-to-late summer demand regime for ladies denim trousers (late July 2019). Demand has significantly dropped from its spring peak (~350+ units) and stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, demand over the last 7 periods (P17-P23) has averaged approximately 128 units/week (160, 140, 113, 70, 99, 155, 160). Period 23 saw a slight uptick to 160 units, which is consistent with the recent range but indicates we should not drop the forecast too aggressively. On-hand inventory is high (478 units) relative to recent demand. Since the lead time is 4 periods and we have 43 units in-transit (due to arrive in P27), our total inventory position covers more than 4 weeks of current demand. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift to the summer trough, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed (June-July): Average demand for P17-P23 is ~128 units/week, a significant decrease from the spring average (~240 units/week).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-29. Historical demand for the month of July (P21-P24) shows values of 99, 155, 160, and 59, demonstrating significant volatility but maintaining the low-season summer trough characteristic previously identified (average ~118 units/week). Retail cycles for denim trousers usually see a late-summer lull before a 'Back to School' or autumn refresh in late August/September. On-hand inventory is high at 419 units, with 229 units in-transit (P23 and P24 orders). Total pipeline + on-hand is 648 units. Given the current demand average, this covers approximately 5.5 weeks of supply, which is sufficient as lead time is 4 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 weeks (P17-P24) to capture the summer regime while allowing for the volatility observed in July. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to account for the high variance in July demand (59 to 160). Lead time is stable at 4.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019-08-12). Demand for ladies denim trousers has historically shown significant shifts based on seasonality. After a summer trough in June and July (averaging ~110-130 units/week), the most recent demand in Period 26 was 131, following a slight upward trend from Period 24 (59) and Period 25 (90). This suggests a transition toward late-summer or early-fall demand recovery. We are currently holding 198 units on-hand with 627 in-transit. Lead times for successful shipments remain stable at 4 periods. Given the transition out of the summer trough, I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this emerging recovery trend (averaging ~114 per period recently) while allowing for higher sensitivity as we enter the next season. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to use historical averages, acknowledging the stable 4-period pattern while accounting for the lost shipment in the pipeline history.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend detected in August: Demand increased from 59 in P24 to 131 in P26, suggesting the end of the summer trough.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256001' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is emerging from its summer demand trough. In August (P25-P27), demand has shown a clear recovery trend: 90, 131, and 174 units respectively. This aligns with typical pre-autumn/back-to-school retail patterns where denim interest renews. The current on-hand inventory is low at 67 units, while there is a substantial pipeline of 584 units. Specifically, the order from P24 (186 units) is expected to arrive during P28, and the order from P25 (26 units) in P29. While lead times have been consistent at 4 periods for successful shipments, the lost order from P6 remains a historical outlier. Given the recent demand acceleration (averaging ~132 units over the last 3 periods but trending upwards toward 174), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this local recovery trend. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 4 periods, and sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend confirmed in August: Weekly demand increased from a July low of ~59 to 174 in P27, indicating the start of the autumn sales cycle.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late August (2019-08-26), transitioning into the autumn sales cycle. Recent demand history shows a clear recovery from the summer trough (Period 24 demand: 59) to a sustained higher level (Period 27 & 28 demand: 174, 176). This confirms a new regime shift compared to the June-July average of ~128 units/week. Lead times are stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P27 and P28). I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P26-P28) where demand shifted to 131, 174, and 176 to capture this upward momentum for the autumn season. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility during this trend reversal. Pipeline inventory is currently high (485 units), but with a 4-period lead time and increasing demand, maintaining the base stock calculation ensures we don't stock out as the recovery continues.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery confirmed: Demand increased from July lows (~60) to a sustained average of ~160 units/week in August (P26-P28).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256001 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is entering the high-demand autumn cycle (September). Demand has recovered from the summer trough (~60-120 units) and stabilized at an average of ~172 units over the last 4 periods (P26-P29). However, a stockout occurred in Period 29 because the Period 26 order (372 units) is still in transit (expected to arrive in Period 30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To meet the autumn recovery and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the upward shift from the summer lows. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) as recent arrivals (P27, P28, P29) confirm that the supply chain is delivering reliably in 4 periods after the Period 6 loss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $613.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for ladies' denim has entered an autumn recovery phase following the summer trough (June/July). Weekly demand has stabilized and grown over the last five periods (P26-P30), with values of 131, 174, 176, 167, and 197. This results in a 5-period average of approximately 169 units/week. Given the date (Early September), this upward trend is expected to continue or stabilize as fall fashion cycles peak. On-hand inventory is currently 175, with 478 units in-transit (orders from P28, P29, and P30). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the recent arrival of the P26 order in P30. To maintain a sufficient base stock for the next 5 periods (L+1) while accounting for recent growth, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 5 demand samples (avg ~169) to calculate the 5-period forecast (~845). sigma_hat is also set based on these 5 periods to capture the recent moderate volatility in the recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery confirmed: Average demand for P26-P30 is ~169 units/week, a significant increase from the July trough of ~60-90 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the autumn peak season (September). We are currently experienceing a stockout at Period 31 due to demand rising to 232, which is significantly higher than the August average (~168). Starting 2019-09-02, a clear upward trend is visible (197 to 232). I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) to capture this acceleration, resulting in a weekly mean of ~200. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must protect against further seasonal increases. Pipeline inventory is currently 687 units (from orders in P28-P31), but we are currently at zero on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand acceleration confirmed: Demand increased from August average of ~168 to 232 by Period 31 (+38%), marking the start of the September peak season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late September peak season (Period 33, 2019/9/23). Demand has significantly recovered from the summer trough (~60-90 units) and accelerated in September, with Period 31 demand reaching 232 units. Although Period 32 demand was slightly lower (195), we are experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) because demand is outpacing arrivals. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a robust base stock to capture the autumn demand. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent autumn/September demand regime (avg ~195-200), ensuring the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time + review period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: September demand (P30-P32) has stabilized at an average of ~208 units/week, up from the August average of ~160.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256001' (Ladies Denim Trousers) has entered its autumn peak season. Period 33 demand was 317, significantly higher than the early September average of ~208, indicating a spike as we approach October. Current on-hand inventory is 0, having stocked out in the last three periods (P31-P33) despite arrivals, showing that recent orders were insufficient for the demand surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P29 order arriving in P33. To prevent further stockouts and capture the high autumn demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to focus on the September demand regime (P30-P33), which effectively captures the shift from ~197 to ~317. This will set mu_hat based on an average demand of ~236 units/period, ensuring the base stock covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak acceleration: Demand spiked to 317 in Period 33, significantly exceeding the previous September average of ~200; SKU has experienced stockouts for three consecutive periods (P31-P33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an autumn peak season (September/October), which has resulted in four consecutive periods of stockouts (P31-P34). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The demand average over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 240 units/week, with a significant spike of 317 in P33. To address the persistent stockouts and capture the high seasonal demand, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this heightened volatility and mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P28, P29, P30). The total pipeline (978 units) combined with a robust mu_hat should trigger the OR engine to maintain a high base stock to recover from the stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand for P30-P34 averaged ~240 units/week, causing sustained stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an autumn peak season (September/October), with demand averaging approximately 240 units over the last five periods (P31-P35: 232, 195, 317, 259, 218). Despite consistent 4-period lead times, the system has faced recurring stockouts (P31-P35) due to high demand and low on-hand inventory. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with a large pipeline of 1087 units. To optimize the base stock for the current regime and ensure replenishment covers the remaining 11 periods of the game, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime (N=5) and using a calculated lead time of 4. This will help the OR engine maintain a safety stock appropriate for the detected volatility while managing the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn peak: Demand from P31-P35 reflects a consistent high-demand regime averaging ~244 units/week, up significantly from August levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $937.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in an autumn peak demand regime (October), which has seen demand stabilize at a high level. Period 36 demand was 236 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 245 units/week. While there was a spike to 317 in P33, the recent trend suggests a sustainable level around 240-250. Previous stockouts from P31-P35 were resolved in P36 as the P32 shipment (243 units) arrived on time (L=4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this sustained autumn peak, and use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility during this peak. This should maintain a service level sufficient to avoid further stockouts while recognizing the current stabilization of demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the mid-autumn peak for ladies denim trousers. Demand has been high, causing sustained stockouts or near-stockouts since P31, with recent demand figures (P31-P37) being: 232, 195, 317, 259, 218, 236, 236. The average demand for this autumn peak regime (last 7 periods) is approximately 242 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of the P33 order in P37. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The pipeline (in-transit) is 1,110 units, which covers roughly 4.6 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the high demand and the stockout in P37, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this specific autumn regime (average ~242 * (1+4) = 1210). This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level that accounts for the current sustained peak while avoiding over-ordering as we approach potential year-end demand shifts.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P31-P37) remains sustained at an average of ~242 units/week, significantly higher than August levels (~168).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the autumn/early winter season for ladies' denim. Historical demand for the autumn peak (P31-P38) has been sustained at a high level, averaging 240 units per week. Although the most recent demand (P38) dropped to 197, the previous weeks (P33-P37) consistently ranged from 218 to 317. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P34 order arrived in P38). We currently have 133 units on hand and a large pipeline of 952 units (orders from P35-P38). To avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the year, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the autumn peak regime while allowing for the slight moderation observed in the most recent week. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a standard safety buffer for this volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the mid-autumn/early winter season for ladies' denim trousers. Recent demand (P31-P39) has stabilized into a high-demand regime averaging approximately 235 units per week (min 195, max 317). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P36-P39) show a consistent average of 222.75 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all recent successful arrivals (P30, P32, P33, P34, P35 orders all arrived with L=4). Pipeline inventory is healthy at 883 units (covering orders from P36-P39), which aligns with the observed mean demand over the lead time. Setting mu_hat to capture this recent sustained average (recent_N=9 covers Oct/Nov) to prevent over-ordering as we approach the end of the year, while sigma_hat is set using recent_N to reflect the current period's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-demand regime (P31-P39) confirmed at an average of ~235 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The SKU (ladies denim trousers) is in a stable autumn/winter high-demand regime. Average demand from Period 31 to Period 40 is approximately 233 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (Periods 35, 36, 38, 39, and 40 each saw shipments arrive exactly 4 periods after ordering). Current on-hand inventory is 232, with 791 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, P40). I will use the recent demand average (last 10 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock for the current (1+L) window (5 periods). The target service level is high due to the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The SKU '399256001' (Ladies Denim Trousers) remains in its Autumn/Winter high-demand regime. Average demand since the September stabilization (Period 30 to Period 41) is approximately 228 units per week. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) has been very consistent (236, 197, 222, 220, 209), averaging 217 units/week. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P33 through P37. Inventory is currently healthy with 262 on-hand and 761 in-transit, following a period of stockouts in Sept/Oct. For parameter setting, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained high-demand regime established in the autumn months. This provides a stable forecast for the OR backend to maintain the target service level as we move towards the end of the year.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (Dec 2). Period 42 showed a massive demand spike (467 units), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (Nov 22-Dec 2 window). This spike depleted all on-hand inventory. The autumn/winter baseline demand remains around 235 units, but we must account for this volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The pipeline is healthy (788 units), with a 249-unit arrival from Period 39 expected in Period 43's arrival phase. To prevent future stockouts while demand remains elevated for the holiday season, I will use a 12-week recent average (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime since September, including the recent spike. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to allow the backend to use the full historical variance, ensuring a sufficient safety stock for these volatile peak periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Significant demand spike in P42 (467 units) confirmed as a seasonal peak event (Black Friday window), significantly exceeding the autumn average of ~235.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (early December). Period 42 showed a massive spike (467 units) corresponding to Black Friday, while Period 43 returned to a more moderate level (181 units). The overall autumn/winter baseline (P31-P43, excluding the P42 spike) averages approximately 230 units/week. As we enter the mid-December period, demand typically remains steady or slightly increases for holiday shopping before a potential post-Christmas drop. My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5 weeks). Given the recent volatility and the risk of stockouts seen in P42, I will use a recent window (N=13, covering the autumn/winter regime) to calculate the mean demand, while ensuring the lead time remains at the established 4 periods. The current pipeline is high (930 units) due to aggressive ordering in response to the P42 spike, so the OR engine will likely moderate the order this period to prevent excessive holding costs as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday peak confirmed in P42 (467 units); demand normalized to ~181 units in P43, suggesting a return to the winter baseline of ~235 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019-12-16). We are moving past the Black Friday peak (P42 demand: 467) into a more stabilized winter demand phase. The last two periods (P43-P44) show demand around 180-200. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a pipeline of 1168 units. The period 41 order (209 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 45 resolution, as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Since we are approaching the end of the simulation (total 47 periods), we need to ensure we maintain enough stock to cover the remaining 3 periods (P45, P46, P47) while avoiding excessive holding costs on the final unsold items. mu_hat is set using N=5 (P40-P44) to capture the post-Black Friday normalization (average ~256 including the outlier, but the backend will use the raw mean) which should provide a safe buffer for year-end demand. L remains at the promised 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand normalization confirmed: Following the P42 peak (467), demand in P43-P44 averaged ~193 units, aligning with a stable winter baseline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-Christmas/Holiday week. Historically, the demand for ladies' denim trousers in late December tends to stabilize or slightly decline after the major Black Friday peak (P42). Recent demand (P43-P45) has averaged 190.3 units, signaling a normalization toward a winter baseline after the outlier spike. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 1 period remaining in the game (P47), the objective is to ensure enough stock to cover the final period's demand while minimizing ending inventory. On-hand inventory is low (24), but the pipeline is very full (1297 units), largely due to large orders placed in P43-P45 to restock after the P42 stockout. I will use the recent 3-period demand average (N=3) to set mu_hat, reflecting the post-peak normalization, and standard volatility to manage the final period's risk.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P45) has stabilized at an average of ~190 units/week, down from the winter average of ~235.

Daily Reward (R_t): $517.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final week of December. Historically, demand for this ladies' denim trouser product showed a post-Black Friday stabilization around 190 units/week (P43-P45), but Period 46 saw a further dip to 148 units, likely due to Christmas holiday timing. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P42 arrived in P46). On-hand inventory is low (75), but pipeline inventory is extremely high (1098 units), primarily from large orders placed in P43-P45 (391, 369, 338 units). These orders, placed during the Black Friday peak/recovery, are significantly larger than current demand requirements. Given the existing on-hand plus the massive incoming pipeline, no additional units are required. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak normalization while maintaining a safe buffer, but the OR backend's capped policy will ensure no new order is placed due to the 1000+ units already in transit.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling: Demand in Period 46 (148) dropped below the previous post-Black Friday average of ~190, signaling typical late-December retail deceleration.
