The SKU is transitioning from a 'new item' phase (0 sales) into active demand as we approach spring. The average demand over the last three active weeks is 30 units/period (14+47+29 / 3). Given the current date is mid-February, we should expect demand for 'V-neck blouses in airy weave' to steadily increase or stabilize as spring fashion cycles begin. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to order immediately to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). Based on an average of 30 units/period, the pipeline needs to be at least 150 units (30 x 5). Considering a target service level and the recent peak of 47 units, I will order 160 units to establish safety stock and cover the lead time gap.",

Since I have 160 units in transit covering roughly 6 periods of demand (160/26.5 \u2248 6), and no new lead time data is available yet, I will hold further ordering until I see the impact of initial demand and the first arrival to avoid excessive holding costs.

Historical data from early 2019 shows demand starting from zero in January and scaling up to 47 by February 4th. In the current periods, demand was 16 (P1) and 23 (P2), totaling 39 unmet units due to zero stock. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The Order placed in Period 1 (160 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (L=4: P1+4=P5). I will see this arrival reported at the start of Period 6. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Period 3, 4, 5, and 6 (the current period plus the L periods of lead time). Forecast: Based on the trend of 23-47 units and the seasonal shift towards spring, I estimate demand at ~40 units/period. Pipeline needed: 4 periods * 40 units = 160 units. Current pipeline (In-transit) is exactly 160 units. However, since the P1 order won't arrive until P5, I have missed P1 and P2 demand and will definitely miss P3 and P4 demand.

Following the timeline: the P1 order (160 units) is expected to arrive during P5 (P1+4=P5) and will be visible in the P6 START message. Therefore, I will not see physical stock until next period's arrival phase. The inventory pipeline (On-hand 0 + In-transit 200) covers roughly 8-10 periods of demand at the current average rate. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the 4-period lead time, I must avoid overstocking.

As of Period 15, on-hand inventory is 180 units and there are 50 units in-transit (ordered P11 and P12).

Based on the current demand regime of ~45 units, total demand over 5 periods (P15-P19) is expected to be ~225 units. Since on-hand plus in-transit (230) effectively covers this period with very little safety stock, and holding costs ($1) are 25% of profit ($4), I will place a conservative order to maintain inventory levels for the end of June/early summer without overstocking, as the spring peak has passed.",

In Period 27 (mid-August), demand spiked to 118, although it dipped back to 39 in Period 28; however, we were stock-constrained in Period 28 (starting inventory + arrival = 30, sold 30, demand 39), meaning actual demand was higher than sales. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. My target is to maintain enough stock to cover the upcoming 5 periods (Lead Time + current period). Pipeline inventory is currently 520 units. Expected demand for the fall regime is estimated between 80-120 units per week. I've placed significant orders in the last three periods (P26: 65, P27: 110, P28: 325) totaling 500 units. To reach a pipeline target of ~600 units (5 weeks * 120 demand), and considering I have 0 on-hand, I will order an additional 100 units to ensure consistent supply for the remainder of the peak season, while being mindful of potential overstocking if demand stabilizes lower.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' Blouse. A massive demand spike occurred in Period 42 (315 units, date: 2019/11/25), which corresponds to Black Friday week. This spike completely depleted the 100 units on-hand. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The current date is 2019/12/2 (Cyber Monday week), where demand is also likely to be elevated, though historically December demand for this type of basic apparel often moderates after the initial holiday rush. However, the system is now out of stock. In-transit inventory consists of 80 units (ordered P40, due P44) and 50 units (ordered P41, due P45). Total period is 47, meaning only 5 periods remain (43, 44, 45, 46, 47). I need to cover demand for the final weeks. Based on historical non-holiday troughs (30-40) and the recent spike, I will forecast a post-peak average of 50 units/week for the remaining duration. Total pipeline needed for the rest of the game (5 periods * 50) is ~250 units. Pipeline currently has 130 units. I will order 120 units to bridge this gap, ensuring availability for the final stretches of the year.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 739953002 (Women's V-neck blouse) is currently experiencing a massive Q4 demand surge. Period 42 (Black Friday week) saw demand hit 315 units, and Period 43 (Cyber Monday/early December) remained high at 144 units, resulting in a stockout. My current on-hand inventory is 0. Based on the 4-period lead time, deliveries from orders placed in Period 40 (80 units) and Period 41 (50 units) are expected to arrive in Period 44 and Period 45 respectively. However, given the sustained holiday demand (estimated at ~100-150 units/week through mid-December), the current pipeline (250 units total) is insufficient to prevent further stockouts and maximize profit. I am ordering 150 units to replenish the pipeline for the final periods (the game ends at Period 47), ensuring coverage for the remaining high-demand weeks before potential end-of-year tapering.",

Period 45 (2019/12/16) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'V-neck blouse in an airy weave', which typically sees holiday-related demand spikes for parties and gifting during December. Historical data shows two major surges: Black Friday (P42 demand: 315) and the subsequent week (P43 demand: 144). Period 44 saw a sharp drop to 29 units, which may be a temporary dip or a sign that the peak gifting season is tapering off as we approach December 16th. However, pre-Christmas shopping often sustains some elevated demand. Current on-hand is 51 units. In-transit consists of orders from P41 (50 units), P43 (120 units), and P44 (150 units). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The P41 order (50 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P45) and be visible in P46. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P45, P46, P47), any order placed now (P45) with a 4-period lead time will NOT arrive before the game ends (it would arrive in Period 49). Therefore, the priority is to manage current on-hand and already in-transit inventory to maximize sales and minimize final holding costs. No new orders are placed because they won't arrive in time.",

With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 46) would not arrive until Period 50 (Period 46 + 4), which is historical the game's end (Total Periods: 47). Consequently, no new orders can arrive in time to be sold. Furthermore, the in-transit inventory of 270 units includes the 120 units ordered in Period 43 (expected in Period 47) and 150 units ordered in Period 44 (expected after the game ends). Period 47's arrival of 120 units will likely cover the final period's demand, given that demand often spikes then trails off after holiday peaks (Period 45 saw 196 units). Because orders placed in Period 46 cannot reach the vending machine before the simulation concludes, the optimal action is to order 0 to avoid unnecessary costs or stranded capital.",
