Seasonally, we are in February (late winter/early spring). b) Demand Analysis: Historical data shows a clear upward trend: 55, 60, 66 (Jan) -> 88, 108 (early Feb). Demand is accelerating, likely due to spring/summer inventory building or early spring shopping. The average is ~75, but the latest point (108) suggests a higher regime. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is Period 1, no arrivals are expected yet. d) Pipeline Assessment: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. My pipeline is completely empty. e) Order Logic: I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (L+1 periods) before the first order arrives at the end of Period 5 (visible P6). Given the growth (108 last week), I will forecast an average of ~115 units per period over the lead time. 115 * 5 = 575 units total needed to avoid stockouts while the pipe fills.",

Total in-transit is 575 units (ordered P1, expected P5). I will forecast a slightly higher demand of ~110 units per period to account for the growth trend. Total target inventory for 5 periods = 110 * 5 = 550 units. My current in-transit (575) already covers this target through Period 5. However, since the replenishment won't arrive until Period 5 (L=4) and I am currently stocking out, I will place a smaller maintenance order of 100 units to begin building a buffer for Period 6 onwards, while monitoring if the lead time holds true.",

No orders have arrived yet (P1 order of 575 is expected to arrive in Period 5). There is no evidence yet to suggest lead time differs from promised, though the current 'sold=0' is due to 0 on-hand stock.\n\nInventory & Forecast: Demand is currently averaging ~130 units/week over the last 3 periods. Total In-transit is 900 (575+100+225). Forecast for next 5 periods (Lead Time 4 + 1 for current period): 130 * 5 = 650 units. \nPipeline check: On-hand (0) + In-transit (900) = 900. \nWhile 900 covers the immediate forecast of 650, demand is trending upward seasonally.

Historically, demand rose through March and April (averaging ~200-240), but P13 saw a sharp drop to 128 (coinciding with early May). However, early May volatility is common, and the approaching true summer months (June/July) usually sustain high demand for basic T-shirts. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P9 arrived at the start of P14). On-hand inventory is 518. In-transit pipeline includes: P10 (250 units, arriving P15), P11 (300 units, arriving P16), P12 (300 units, arriving P17), and P13 (50 units, arriving P18). Total pipeline + On-hand = 1418 units. This covers the next 5 periods (L+1) at an average burn rate of 283 units/period. Given the recent dip in demand to 128 and the high stock level (518 units) which incurs $1/unit holding cost, I will place a conservative order of 150 units to maintain a steady flow for peak summer (arriving P19) while avoiding excessive overstock if the P13 dip persists.",

(b) Demand Analysis: Demand peaked in mid-to-late April (267 units) but has softened significantly in the last two weeks (128 and 171 units). This suggests the initial spring rush has leveled off, though summer weather typically keeps demand for basic tees between 180-230 units. (c) Lead Time: Confirmed at 4 periods based on systematic arrivals (P10 ordering arrived at P14). (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is high (597 units). In-transit consists of P11 (300 arrival P15), P12 (300 arrival P16), P13 (50 arrival P17), and P14 (150 arrival P18), totaling 800 in-transit. Safety stock is high.

At an estimated demand of 200-220 units per week, 5 periods of demand equals ~1,100 units.

  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9, 2019) out of a total 47 periods. The product is a short-sleeved jersey baby tee, which is highly seasonal and currently in its terminal winter phase. Demand has stabilized at a very low secondary floor, averaging approximately 18-24 units per week over the last month (P40-P43 average: 21). With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P44, P45, P46, P47), total expected demand is approximately 80-100 units. Our current on-hand inventory is 243 units, which is more than double the required amount to satisfy all remaining demand. Since the holding cost is $1.0/unit and the profit is only $1.0/unit, maintaining excess stock is detrimental to the total reward. No further orders are required, and the goal is now to minimize total holding costs by liquidating the existing stock through natural demand.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved jersey basic), which is highly seasonal and currently in its terminal winter phase (mid-December). Demand has consistently hovered between 15-28 units per week over the last five periods, with a clear downward trend as the year ends. Current on-hand inventory is 228 units. There are 3 periods remaining in the game (Periods 45, 46, and 47). Given the current demand rate of approximately 15-20 units, the total expected demand for the remainder of the game is roughly 45-60 units. Since on-hand inventory (228) significantly exceeds this requirement, any further ordering would only increase holding costs without contributing to additional sales. The lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (P45) would not arrive until Period 49, which is beyond the game's end (P47). Therefore, the optimal strategy is to maintain a zero-order position.",

On-hand inventory is 172 units, which is far more than enough to cover the demand for this final period (P47 demand resolution occurs after the decision phase).
