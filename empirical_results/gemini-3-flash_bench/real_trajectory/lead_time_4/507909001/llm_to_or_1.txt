Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of the simulation (Period 1, 2019-02-11). The historical demand for this cotton-blend shirt (SKU 507909001) shows a slight downward trend over the last 5 weeks: 80, 144, 194, 176, 129. The mean of these 5 samples is 144.6. Given the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean (144.6 * 5 = 723), I'll set 'mu_hat' to default and 'L' to default to establish an initial inventory position. 'sigma_hat' is also set to default to capture the historical volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (P1) saw a demand of 250 units, which is significantly higher than the average of the initial 5 samples (avg: 144.6). The historical demand trend shows a steady increase from 80 to 194 before a dip to 129, but the P1 leap to 250 suggests a potential seasonal ramp-up or a new demand level for this 'Gently tailored shirt'. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order of 218 units placed in P1 is expected to arrive in P5. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 218 units in transit. Since we only have one period of operational history and five initial samples, I will use a hybrid approach: 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) focusing on the last 3 samples (including the P1 spike) to capture the upward trend without overreacting entirely to one data point, while remaining conservative on volatility (sigma_hat) using all available history including P1 to account for the high variance observed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's tailored shirt, likely experiencing a seasonal upswing as spring approaches. Historical demand from early Jan to early Feb (80, 144, 194, 176, 129) averaged ~145. However, Period 1 and 2 demand (250, 454) shows a significant and rapid escalation. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, no orders (placed in P1 or P2) could have arrived yet (P1 order due P5, P2 order due P6). Currently, on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 500 (218 + 282). We are experiencing high stockout costs (Profit $1) vs holding costs ($1), and a clear upward trend in demand. I will use a recent_N (N=2) to capture the recent spike in demand for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default promised lead time (L=4) as we have no evidence to the contrary yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt' is a women's tailored blouse. Demand samples from history (Jan-Feb) were [80, 144, 194, 176, 129] (mean ~145). However, the game history since Period 1 shows a significant jump in demand: P1=250, P2=454, P3=312. This suggests a seasonal shift or a higher baseline for the current period (Feb-Mar). The promised lead time is 4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in P6). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 1090 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). For Period 4, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand levels (avg ~338 per period). Since L=4, mu_hat will be calculated as (1+4)*338. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility in the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 1 (avg increased from ~145 to ~338). No lead time data yet as the first order (P1) is not due until P5 resolution.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a women's shirt (blouse), and the date is mid-March, which typically aligns with the start of Spring fashion demand. The initial five historical samples (Jan-Feb) had a mean of ~145, but the four periods of live play (Feb-March) have shown significantly higher demand (250, 454, 312, 214), averaging ~307. Based on this regime shift, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volume and volatility. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (218 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's resolution and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at P6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 1601 units in-transit. I will stay with the 'default' (promised) lead time until we observe actual arrivals to confirm any drift.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. The demand for 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt' (Women's Blouse) saw an initial spike in Period 2 (454 units) and has since moderated (190 units in Period 5). Historical data (Jan-Feb) showed mean demand ~145, but since Period 1, the mean has risen to approximately 284 units (250, 454, 312, 214, 190). Lead time is 4, so we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Current inventory position: On-hand (28) + In-transit (1383 minus 218 arrived = 1165) = 1193 units. Using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime which is higher than the initial pre-game samples but appears to be stabilizing/trending downwards after a peak. This will help the OR engine set a base stock that accounts for the observed volatility and higher mean.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Post-Jan demand regime (P1-P5) average is 284 units, significantly higher than pre-game average of 145.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The item is a women's tailored shirt. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 145, but Period 1-6 demand averaged 265.5 (250, 454, 312, 214, 190, 173). There is a clear downward trend in the last 4 periods (312 -> 214 -> 190 -> 173). The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in P5 and P6. Currently, we have 137 on-hand and 1110 in-transit. The OR backend will calculate base_stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent N=4 for demand captures the recent decline better than the full-game average, while still acknowledging the level shift from the pre-game data. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to capture the high volatility seen in the early weeks of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-shift (starting P1) shows a cooling trend: P1-P2 average was 352, while P3-P6 average fell to 222.25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-217.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1st) shows the product (a cotton blend blouse) is entering the spring season. Historical demand shows a significant spike in February (avg ~338 units), followed by a cooling trend in March (avg ~208 units). The most recent demand was 255. Given the product type, demand is likely to remain steady or slightly increase as spring progresses. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (472) with a large in-transit pipeline (520). To avoid overstocking while holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering Periods 3-7) which captures the stabilization after the initial February peak. This provides a balanced forecast of approximately 228 units per period (1140 for L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized in March (Periods 4-7) at an average of 208 units per week, following the higher February peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-275.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a women's tailored shirt, which typically sees demand spikes in late spring and early summer as people refresh their work and formal wardrobes. Looking at recent demand history, there was a significant uptick in Period 8 (demand=354) compared to the March average of ~208. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 629 and 161 in-transit (ordered P6 and P8), the total pipeline is 790. To account for the observed spring demand increase, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 (covering Periods 6, 7, and 8) to capture this upward shift while maintaining a buffer. The Lead time (L) remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand shift detected: Period 8 demand (354) is 70% higher than the March average (208), corresponding to seasonal patterns for women's tailored shirts in April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (2019/04/15). The 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt' is a women's tailored blouse. Historical data shows a seasonal peak in February (averaging ~338), followed by a cooling in March (averaging ~208). Period 8 showed a spike (354) followed by a sharp drop in Period 9 (147). Given the 'Women's Tailoring' category, mid-April often transitions away from early spring peaks before late-spring demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). mu_hat needs to capture the recent volatility and the overall trend since the start of the game. I will use recent_N with N=9 to cover the entire active game history (averaging ~260 per period), as the pre-game samples (avg 145) are no longer representative. This results in a mu_hat of (1+4)*260 = 1300. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=9 to reflect the observed post-launch volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 starts on 2019-04-22. We are in the mid-to-late April spring season for women's tailored shirts. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 1 (February) compared to the pre-game January data, followed by stabilization in March around 208 units, and then a spike in Period 8 (354 units). The last two periods (9 and 10) had lower demand (147 and 218), but April generally represents a transition month. The average demand since the Period 1 shift is 255.7 units per week. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. There is a missing shipment from Period 5 (ordered 0, so ignore) and an expected arrival in the current period from the large order in Period 7 (none placed). In-transit inventory (814) includes orders from P8 (152), P9 (410), and P10 (252). I am setting L to the confirmed lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=10 (covering the entire post-P1 regime) to capture the higher mean compared to early January, resulting in (1+4)*255.7 = 1278.5. Sigma_hat is set to default to cover the observed volatility across this period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/04/29) context: Demand for the 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt' has shown significant volatility throughout April. After a peak of 354 in Period 8, demand settled to 147, 218, and 140 in the subsequent three weeks. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 214.75, which aligns closely with the March average (208) and indicates the early April spike was a temporary peak rather than a sustained regime shift. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent conclusions (P1-P4 and P6 arrivals). Total pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 1011 units, which includes orders from P8 (152), P9 (410), P10 (252), and P11 (197). On-hand inventory is 133 units. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is q = 0.5 (z=0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent stabilized demand behavior (Avg ~215) and account for the standard lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: April demand spike (P8) was temporary; demand has returned to a stabilized mean of ~215 (P8-P11 average).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13 (2019/05/06). The product is a women's tailored shirt, which experienced a seasonal demand spike in early April (Period 8) but has since stabilized. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 163.25 units, which is lower than the previous regime of ~215 observed earlier in spring. This suggests a secondary cooling as we move further into May. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time remains 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P12) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is high (859 units), largely due to orders from P9, P10, and P11 which are expected to arrive in P13, P14, and P15 respectively. An order from P7 (0 units) would have arrived in P11, and no order was placed in P12. Given current on-hand (137) and expected arrivals, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the stabilized lower demand (approx 163 units/week), ensuring the OR backend handles the current stock levels without over-ordering during this stable phase.

Carry-over insight: Post-April demand stabilized at a lower mean of ~163 units/week (Periods 9-12), down from the ~215 mean observed in early spring.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14 (May 13), we are entering a late spring/early summer phase for the SKU '507909001' (Womens Tailoring Shirt). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival from Period 9 in Period 13's conclusion. Demand analysis shows a significant cooling trend: the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has dropped to 151 units, compared to the previously observed stabilized mean of ~215. The most recent demand (Period 13) of 112 units marks a clear decrease. Currently, we have 435 units on-hand and 449 in-transit, totaling 884 units of inventory. With a projected weekly demand of ~150 units, this inventory covers approximately 5.8 periods, exceeding the lead-time demand plus review period (L+1 = 5). Therefore, the system should allow the current high inventory levels to deplete. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent low-demand regime, and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~215 to ~150 (-30%) over the last 5 periods (P9-P13).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), demand for the women's tailored shirt has entered a sustained low-traffic regime. The last three periods (P12-P14) recorded demand of 148, 112, and 86 units respectively, confirming the downward trend noted in the P14 insight. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 133.2 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is high at 601 units, which is approximately 4.5 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. There are also 197 units in-transit (ordered P11, due P15 resolution), which will bring total coverage to nearly 6 weeks. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, the OR engine seeks a 50% service level for the base stock. However, current inventory already significantly exceeds any base stock level calculated from recent demand. I am setting L to 4 as established by history, and using recent_N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current cooling trend while awaiting the expected arrival of the P11 order.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Mean demand from P10-P14 has dropped to 133 units, following the post-April seasonal decline for tailored blouses.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507909001 (Women's tailored shirt) is in a clear seasonal decline as we move into late May. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) has dropped to approximately 117 units (140, 148, 112, 86, 97), significantly lower than the early spring peak. We currently have 701 units on hand and 0 in transit. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning we aim to keep roughly (L+1) periods of demand. Given our current inventory of 701 units, we have nearly 6 weeks of coverage at current demand rates (701 / 117 \u2248 5.9). Since 5.9 > L+1 (5), we are currently overstocked. I will set the demand parameters using the most recent 5-period window to capture this downward regime shift and allow the OR backend to minimize further ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: Late May demand (P11-P15) has declined to an average of 117 units/week, down from the mid-spring average of ~150.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd (Period 17). Historical demand data and carry-over insights indicate a significant downward trend in demand for this SKU (Womens Tailoring / Blouses) as we move further into the summer season. Demand has consistently dropped from an average of ~215 in April to ~150 in early May, and most recently to 117 units/week. Period 16 showed a further drop to 64 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 637 units, which exceeds the total expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods) given the current mean of ~112 units/week (last 5 periods avg). Additionally, all in-transit inventory has now arrived. To avoid further excessive holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (P12-P16) to capture the current plateau, and keep L at default since lead times have been stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand decline confirmed: Demand mean for P12-P16 has dropped to 101 units/week, a 33% reduction from the P9-P13 average (~150).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10), we are seeing the continued impact of the summer demand decline for tailored blouses. Demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) has averaged 109.6 units, but the most recent period (P17) saw a spike to 189 units. Despite this spike, on-hand inventory remains high at 448 units due to the recent large arrivals from April orders. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and we have a target cycle of 5 (L+1), we have roughly 4 weeks of inventory based on the current mean. No orders are currently in-transit. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the lower seasonal demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a shorter window (N=5) to capture the recent low-demand regime while acknowledging the recent volatility. The OR backend will likely not place an order this period because the current on-hand inventory of 448 far exceeds the expected demand for the next 5 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (summer). We are observing a significant demand shift. Demand in P17 (189) and P18 (176) has spiked above the previously established 'summer decline' average of ~100. This suggests a potential mid-summer sale or a seasonal rebound for tailored blouses. The mean for the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is ~122, but the last two periods show a clear upward trend. To avoid a stockout given the 4-period lead time, I am adjusting \u03bc\u0302 using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the recent spike while smoothing the noise. Standard deviation (\u03c3\u0302) is notably high due to this volatility (64 to 189 range), so I will use a recent_N of 5 for \u03c3\u0302 to reflect current variability. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods according to the system history.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected in Periods 17-18: Weekly average increased to ~182, up from the P12-P16 average of 101.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (mid-summer). Demand has shown a marked rebound in the last three periods (P17-P19), averaging 214 units/week (189, 176, 277), which is a significant increase from the previous average of ~100. This spike has depleted on-hand inventory to zero. Promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P12, P13, P14, P15) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since demand has shifted abruptly, I am using recent_N with N=3 to capture this new summer rebound regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the recent high volatility (especially Period 19's demand of 277). Lead time is set to default (4) as it has remained stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound regime shift confirmed at Period 20: average demand over the last 3 periods (P17-P19) increased to 214 units/week, up from the summer low of ~100.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are experiencing a stockout with 0 units on-hand and an in-transit balance of 621 units. The demand has shifted upward significantly since mid-June (Period 17). Over the last 4 periods (P17-P20), demand has averaged 211.75 units per week, compared to the summer low of ~100. This rebound corresponds to the seasonality of 'Womens Tailoring | Blouses' likely driven by early-summer office wear or late spring resets. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P14 conclude for P10 order). Our current in-transit (621) consists of orders from P18 (100), P19 (216), and P20 (305). The P18 order (100 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 22. To align with this new demand regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the current mean (~211.75) and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1) = 5 weeks of demand (~1059 units) minus our current pipeline, while accounting for the high unit profit relative to holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507909001 (Womens Tailoring) has undergone a regime shift starting in mid-June (Period 17), rebounding from a summer low of ~100 to an average of ~218 units/week over the last 5 periods (P17-P21). Current data shows: P17: 189, P18: 176, P19: 277, P20: 205, P21: 200. This shift is likely seasonal, as summer inventory cycles transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (last observed arrive/order pair P15/P11). Currently, there is a severe stockout with on-hand inventory at 0 and cumulative demand in P19-P21 significantly exceeding available stock. Orders from P18 (100 units), P19 (216 units), P20 (305 units), and P21 (286 units) are in-transit and expected to arrive in P22, P23, P24, and P25 respectively. To address the current rebound and cover the lead time (L=4), I am using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound shift at Period 17 confirmed: Average demand increased from ~101 to ~218 units/week (+115%) over the last 5 periods (P17-P21).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 23 (July 15). Demand has been in a rebound phase since Period 17, with the average demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) being 204.1 units. The most recent demand (P22) was 178, confirming the shift reported in the carry-over insights. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 947 units (ordered P19-P22: 216+305+286+140). Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the P19 order (216 units) is expected to arrive during the Period 23 resolution, followed by P20 (305 units) in Period 24. Since the OR engine's objective is to cover (L+1) periods of demand, and we are currently seeing a sustained mean of ~204 units, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this rebound regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909001 (women's tailored shirt) is currently in a state of high demand volatility following a mid-summer rebound. Weekly demand since Period 17 has fluctuated significantly: 189, 176, 277, 205, 200, 178, and most recently 105 in Period 23. While the last period shows a sharp drop, the average demand over the last 7 periods (P17-P23) is approximately 190. The carry-over insights confirm a demand shift starting around Period 17, likely due to a mid-summer sale or seasonal restocking cycle. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P22 and P23). Current on-hand inventory is 111, with 805 units in-transit (orders from P20-P23). Since demand appears to be retreating from its July peak (averaging ~211 in P19-P22 vs 105 in P23), I will set mu_hat using a recent window of 5 periods (P19-P23) to capture the cooling trend while still protecting against the higher baseline compared to early summer. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to account for the high variance observed during this rebound phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend observed after the July rebound: Period 23 demand (105) is significantly lower than the P19-P22 average (211).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-182.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/29. After a significant demand rebound in late June and early July (averaging ~218 units in Periods 17-21), demand has cooled significantly in the last two periods (P23: 105, P24: 117), averaging 111. This suggests the summer peak has passed and we are entering a lower demand regime, likely aligning with late summer/pre-autumn transitions for blouses. On-hand inventory is 299, with 549 in-transit units (ordered P21-P24). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), the target cycle service level is 50%, making the OR backend highly sensitive to excess inventory. To avoid overstocking during this cooling period, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the transition from high to low demand (average ~150), and N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This provides a bridge between the recent peak and the current trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Average demand for P23-P24 is 111 units, a ~50% decrease from the P17-P21 average of 218.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Gently tailored shirts' has entered a cooling phase following the July rebound. As analyzed in Carry-over Insights (Period 25), demand for Period 23-25 has averaged ~105 units (105, 117, 92), which is a 50% decrease from the high-summer average of 218. Currently, the SKU has 493 units on-hand and 263 units in-transit (total pipeline of 756 units). At the current stabilized mean of ~105 units/week, the 756 units in the pipeline cover approximately 7.2 weeks of demand. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we are already protected against demand for the next L+1 (5) periods. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent cooling trend (Periods 23-25) and use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the lower volatility of this regime. This strategy aims to minimize holding costs while the high on-hand inventory is depleted by current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend sustained: Average demand for P23-P25 is 105 units (a ~50% decrease from P17-P22 average of 211).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gently tailored shirt' has entered a sustained low-demand regime following a mid-summer peak in July. Over the last four periods (P23-P26), demand has averaged approximately 114.5 units per week (105, 117, 92, 144), which is roughly half of the average seen during the P17-P22 rebound (approx. 211 units). The current On-hand inventory of 489 units is more than sufficient to cover immediate demand, especially as the system is still clearing the high-volume orders placed during the July rebound (123 units remaining in-transit). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P18 through P22. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this stabilized lower demand level, ensuring the OR backend avoids over-ordering while maintaining a safety buffer for the high variance observed in this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-139.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/19. For Period 27 conclude, demand was 212, which is a significant jump from the previous three weeks (92, 117, 144) and the 'cooling trend' noted in the history. This suggests a potential end to the late-summer trough and a return to the mean seen earlier in the rebound phase or potentially a pre-autumn surge for tailored blouses. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is ~134. However, focusing on the last 3 periods (P25-P27) gives a mean of ~149, which better captures the recent upward trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 351 with 49 in-transit units (total 400). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the low floor but account for the recent rise, which resultingly provides a buffer for the observed demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected at Period 27: Demand increased to 212, moving the 3-period average to ~149, up from the ~105 average observed in Periods 23-25.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/26 (Late August). Demand history shows a recurring pattern: a summer low followed by a late-summer/early-fall rebound. Specifically, Periods 27 and 28 demand (212, 232) confirms a shift back to a higher mean compared to the late-July/early-August cooling (avg ~105). This rebound mirrors the shift observed in Periods 17-21. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 168 and in-transit at 213 (total 381), and demand rising, I need to adjust mu_hat to capture this recent upward trend. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters (covering Periods 26-28) to focus on the active rebound while maintaining safety stock for the lead time of 4+1 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand rebound confirmed: Average demand for P27-P28 is 222 units, returning to levels seen in the P17-P22 regime after the mid-summer lull.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Rebecca or Delphine shirt (women's tailoring) has entered a late-August/early-September rebound, confirmed over the last three periods (P27-P29) with an average of approximately 233 units/week. This follows a mid-summer lull (~105 units/week) and aligns with seasonal patterns for business wear as consumers return from summer holidays. The current inventory is 0 on-hand with 485 units in-transit (orders from P28 and P29). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current period (P30) demand will further deplete inventory before reinforcements arrive, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the new confirmed mean of ~233 units per week across the (L+1) horizon. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this specific rebound while using recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed during regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: September demand rebound confirmed: Average demand for P27-P29 is 233 units, representing a 120% increase from the mid-summer lull (P23-P25 average of 105).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), we are observing a significant autumn demand rebound for women's tailored shirts. The last 4 periods (P27-P30) show a clear upward trend in demand: 212, 232, 255, and 344 units, with a 4-period average of 260.75 and a most recent 3-period average of 277. This confirms the 'September demand rebound' note in the insights. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With 0 on-hand inventory and the last two orders (P29, P30) in transit, we are currently stock-out. To capture this momentum while maintaining the OR backend's service level, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the accelerating autumn demand, and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the increasing volatility during this transition. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current high-demand regime rather than the summer lows.

Carry-over insight: September demand acceleration: Demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P27-P30), rising from 212 to 344 units. Avg demand for P27-P30 is 261, signaling a strong autumn season for tailored blouses.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn season (September) for the 'Gently tailored shirt'. Demand has surged from a mid-summer average of ~105 units to a recent 4-period average (P28-P31) of 290 units, with the most recent three periods all exceeding 250 units (232, 255, 344, 329). On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is significant pipeline inventory (1168 units), primarily from large orders placed in Periods 28-31 as part of the autumn ramp-up. The Lead Time is stable at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history. Due to the rapid acceleration in demand observed since August (from ~100 to ~330), I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture this autumn regime, and N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with the high-demand peaks.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909001 (Womens Tailoring Blouse) is in a strong autumn demand regime. After a mid-summer lull (~100 units/week), demand surged in late August and has stabilized at a high level. Recent demand (P30-P32) shows values of 344, 329, and 339, yielding a mean of roughly 337. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and the pipeline contains 1237 units. The Lead Time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P28 arrival in P32), meaning orders placed now handle demand in Period 37 and beyond. The current strategy must focus on maintaining a high base stock to satisfy this sustained autumn peak while accounting for the existing pipeline. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the shift from the ~230s to the ~330s seen in September effectively.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime confirmed: Demand for Periods 30-32 has stabilized at an average of 337 units/week, up from the late-August transition average of ~230.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '507909001' (Womens Tailoring Blouses) has entered a high-demand autumn regime. Period 33 demand reached 378 units, continuing a sustained peak. The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P30-P33) is 347.5 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of an 'Autumn peak regime'. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand, and although 272 units arrived in Period 33, they were entirely consumed by demand, resulting in stockouts. The pipeline inventory is 1312, consisting of orders from P30 (326), P31 (357), P32 (282), and P33 (347). The order from P30 (due in P34 resolution) should help alleviate the stockout. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this current high-demand regime, and sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the current volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909001 (Women's tailoring blouse) is currently in a sustained high-demand autumn regime. Recent demand from Periods 30-33 averaged ~337 units, though Period 34 saw a dip to 208. Given the autumn seasonality, I treat the Period 34 dip as a likely outlier or minor cooling rather than a full regime collapse, as earlier insights confirmed an autumn peak. I will use a 5-period average (P30-P34) to set mu_hat, which averages to 319.6 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals. On-hand inventory is low (118) and we have experienced several stockouts in the last 6 periods, so I am maintaining a robust mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime sustained (P30-P34 avg: 320), despite a single-period dip in P34 (208). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '507909001' (Womens Blouses) is currently in a cooling phase following the autumn peak. After a period of high demand (P30-P33 averaging ~350), the last two periods have seen a significant drop (P34: 208, P35: 128). This decline aligns with the transition from early autumn tailoring demand into mid-October. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the recent steep decline in demand, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this downward trend (averaging P32-P35) while maintaining seasonal awareness. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the increased volatility during this transition. This approach prevents excessive over-ordering as we move past the seasonal peak and helps manage holding costs while maintaining enough stock for potential stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed starting Period 34: Average demand for P34-P35 has dropped to 168 units units, a 50% decrease from the autumn peak (P30-P33 average of 347).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the gently tailored shirt (507909001) has entered a significant cooling phase following the autumn peak. After averaging ~337 units in Periods 30-32, demand has dropped sharply to 208, 128, and 127 in the last three periods (P34-P36). This matches seasonal expectations for mid-to-late October as the autumn transition concludes. The current on-hand inventory (502) and in-transit units (841 from orders in P33-P35) are more than sufficient to cover the current forecast. Specifically, the pipeline contains orders for 347, 383, and 111 units due to arrive in Periods 37, 38, and 39 respectively. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), we aim for a roughly 50% service level. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent precipitous drop (P34-P36 average is 154.3 units) and avoid excessive overstocking as we enter what appears to be a late-autumn/early-winter low period.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Average demand for P34-P36 has dropped to ~154 units, a 54% decrease from the autumn peak (P30-P32 average of 337).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gently tailored shirt' has undergone a significant cooling phase as we move deeper into autumn (late October), following the September peak. The last four periods (P34-P37) show demands of 208, 128, 127, and 158 respectively, yielding a mean of approximately 155 units/week. This is a 50%+ reduction from the 'Autumn peak regime' (P30-P33) which averaged ~347. Given the high on-hand inventory (691 units) and significant units in transit (494), we are currently overstocked relative to this new lower demand regime. Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 1,185 units, which covers over 7 weeks of the current 155-unit/week demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the last 4 periods (N=4) to align the base stock with the current cooling trend and prevent further inventory build-up.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-862.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November, and demand has clearly decelerated from the autumn peak. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged approximately 145 units/week (208, 128, 127, 158, 106). This is down from the previous month's ~337 avg. Stock levels are currently very high (968 on-hand) due to large orders placed during the peak arriving now. With demand dropping, we must minimize additional ordering to avoid excessive holding costs, especially as we approach the final 8 periods of the year. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the last 5 weeks of the cooling trend) and using 'calculate' for lead time, which has been consistent at 4 periods. The high on-hand inventory relative to the pipeline and forecasted demand will correctly lead the OR backend to stop ordering, protecting the total reward from holding cost erosion.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand cooling confirmed: Average demand for P34-P38 has stabilized at 145 units/week, a 57% decrease from the September peak (P30-P33 avg of 347).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Rebecca/Delphine shirt has confirmed a cooling trend since Period 34, following the autumn peak. The average demand over the last six periods (P34-P39) is approximately 138.5 units/week. Currently, the system has 975 units on-hand with zero in-transit, as all previous orders have arrived. Given the lead time is 4 periods and the current inventory covers roughly 7 weeks of demand (975 / 138.5 \u2248 7.0), we are overstocked. To minimize holding costs while the demand is in this lower regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (since the start of the cooling trend) to reflected this reduced need. This will naturally prevent any new orders from being placed until the inventory level drops closer to the safety stock requirement for this demand level.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt' continues its post-autumn cooling trend. The average demand over the last seven periods (P34-P40) is approximately 132 units, while the most recent five periods (P36-P40) average 118 units. Current on-hand inventory is 879 units, which is significantly high given the current demand regime. With no units in transit and a stable lead time of 4 periods, the current inventory already covers over 7 periods of demand at the recent mean (879 / 118 \u2248 7.4). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the stabilized lower demand levels of late autumn. The OR backend should naturally result in zero orders due to the high on-hand balance relative to the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend stabilized: Average demand for P36-P40 is 118 units/week, down from the P30-P33 peak of 347.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a low late-autumn level after the September peak. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 113.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is 774 units with no units in-transit. With 5 periods remaining in the game (P42, P43, P44, P45, P46), the total expected demand until the end of the game is approximately 114 * 5 = 570 units. Since current on-hand (774) already exceeds the entire projected demand for the remainder of the session, no further orders are required. The OR backend needs to be instructed to maintain a base stock lower than the current inventory. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable low-demand regime (approx 115/week), which effectively results in a zero order given the excess inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). The demand for 507909001 (women's tailored shirt) has been in a stabilized low regime since mid-October. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is ~112 units. Recent demand in P42 showed a slight uptick to 150, but it remains well below the autumn peak. Our on-hand inventory is 624 units, which is significantly high given the current demand rate (~112 units/week) and the remaining 5 periods of the game. Our current inventory alone covers more than 5 weeks of demand at the current rate. There is no in-transit inventory. Since our on-hand inventory already exceeds any reasonable base stock level calculated for the remainder of the game (Base Stock \u2248 (1+L)*\u03bc + z\u03c3), the OR engine will naturally place zero orders. We will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the post-peak cooling trend while acknowledging the recent slight increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a low-volume stabilized regime post-autumn peak; average demand for P38-P42 is 112 units/week. Dec 2 starts the final 5 periods of the game with excessive on-hand inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 of 47, with only 4 periods remaining in the game. On-hand inventory is 574 units, which is significantly higher than the current stabilized demand regime (P38-P43 average is ~102 units/week). At the current demand rate, we have enough inventory to cover the remaining periods of the game without further ordering. The promised and actual lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now would not arrive until the game has virtually concluded (Period 48 resolution), making further orders economically non-viable given the high holding cost (equal to profit). I will maintain the stabilized mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods (P38-P43) while relying on the OR backend's logic to see that current pipeline + on-hand far exceeds requirements.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game depletion phase: Current on-hand inventory (574) exceeds projected total remaining demand for Periods 44-47 (~400-450 units).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47, specifically the end-of-game depletion phase. The current on-hand inventory is 471 units. Given that there are only 3 periods of demand remaining (Periods 45, 46, 47) and recent weekly demand has stabilized at approximately 100-110 units (Period 43: 50, Period 44: 103), the total projected demand for the rest of the game is roughly 300-330 units. Since 471 units on-hand already significantly exceeds this projected demand, any further ordering will only increase holding costs without increasing sales. We will maintain L at its calculated value and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to reflect the current low-volume stabilized regime (~102 units/week). No new orders will be triggered by the OR backend as on-hand exceeds base stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47, the penultimate period of the game. The current on-hand inventory is 357 units, with 33 units in-transit (ordered P45, arriving post-game). Based on recent history (P43-P45), demand has stabilized at a low-volume regime with a mean of approximately 89 units (P43: 50, P44: 103, P45: 114). The projected demand for the remaining two periods (P46-P47) is likely between 150-250 units total. Since the on-hand inventory (357) already significantly exceeds this projected demand and any additional order placed now (lead time 4) would never arrive within the game's timeframe, no further ordering is required. My goal is to minimize ending inventory to reduce final holding costs. I set parameters to reflect the recent low-demand regime and verify that no order will be triggered.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-219.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47, the final period of the game. Our objective is to maximize reward, which at this stage means minimizing end-of-game inventory to avoid holding costs, as any units remaining after Period 47 are subject to penalty without further sales opportunity. Currently, we have 288 units on-hand. Additionally, 165 units are in-transit (33 from Period 45 and 132 from Period 46), but with a lead time of 4 periods, these will NOT arrive before the game ends. Therefore, we only need to consider the 288 units currently on-hand. Historical demand over the last several periods (P43-P46) has been consistently low, averaging approximately 84 units per week. Even with a generous late-December demand estimate, the 288 units on-hand are more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand. Placing an additional order now would only incur holding costs or decrease the final reward. Consequently, I am setting parameters to ensure a zero order quantity.
