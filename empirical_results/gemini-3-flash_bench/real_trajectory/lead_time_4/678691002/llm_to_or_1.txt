Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a high-support sports bra. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks ranges from 48 to 81, with a mean of 68.4. Since this is the first period, we have no observed history of actual lead times or arrivals. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. I will use recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation based on the provided 5 samples to capture the immediate past trend. I will use the default promised lead time of 4 until actual arrival data is observed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a high-support sports bra, reflecting steady demand. History (5 samples) shows demand between 48-81, with the most recent observed demand at 56 in Period 1. Since on-hand inventory was 0 at the start of Period 1, all 56 demand units were lost sales. An order of 89 units was placed in Period 1; with a promised lead time of 4, it is not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start message). Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 89. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting (N=5 to include the provided historical samples + Period 1) to capture the current mean more accurately than the full history if it were longer. Since lead time hasn't been observed yet, I'll use the promised lead time (default). Sigma will also use 'recent_N' to reflect recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. Orders were placed in Period 1 (89 units) and Period 2 (82 units), totaling 171 in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible in the Period 6 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand (56 in P1, 60 in P2) cannot be met. Historical demand samples (81, 48, 71, 68, 74) plus recent demand (56, 60) show a mean of approximately 65.4. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 (all available data points) to project demand. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q = 0.5 (Safety stock z* = 0). The OR backend will aim for a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods. I will keep L at default (4) as there is no evidence yet of lead-time deviation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is a high-support sports bra, and the date is March 4, 2019. Historical demand samples (Jan/Feb) range from 48 to 81, with recent period demand (Feb 11 - Feb 25) consistently between 54 and 60. The promised lead time is 4 periods. No orders have arrived yet (Period 1 order is expected during Period 5 resolution and will be visible at the start of Period 6). We are currently experiencing stockouts (0 on-hand), but there are 256 units in-transit (P1: 89, P2: 82, P3: 85). I will use recent_N for demand forecasting (N=5 using provided history and period records) to capture the stable demand mean (approx 68.4). Since demand is stable and we are still within the promised lead-time window, I will stick to the default lead time (4) and standard deviation calculations to maintain service levels while we wait for the pipeline to arrive.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The SKU is a 'CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA' (Sports Bra). Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (totaling 312 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 4, the Period 1 order (89 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts for the first 4 periods. Historical demand (including the 5 pre-game samples and 4 game periods) is relatively stable, ranging from 48 to 81, with a mean of approximately 65. Since no orders have concluded yet, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4) and use the most recent 5 samples (P0-P4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent demand trend (mean ~63). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~315 units), which is roughly what is already in-transit, but we must maintain the parameters to ensure continuous replenishment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 after a lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, due to the lead time delay, the system has incurred significant lost sales from Period 1 to 4. Demand for this high-support sports bra (678691002) has been relatively stable, with the last 5 samples (including those before Period 1) being 81, 48, 71, 68, 74 and the game history samples being 56, 60, 54, 65, 52. The current mean demand is 64.3 units. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. \u03bc\u0302 = 68.3 * 5 = 341.5. On-hand is 37 and In-transit is 223 (Orders from P2, P3, P4). Total pipeline = 260. The OR engine will order (base_stock - pipeline). To ensure we recover from the initial stockout and account for the steady demand, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the full history since the demand is stable but slightly lower than the initial pre-game samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is a sports bra. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks has been relatively stable, averaging 68.4 units/week. Recent samples (P1-P6) show an average demand of 59.5, with a slight upward trend in P6 (70 units). Since the promised lead time (4 periods) has been confirmed by arrivals in P5 and P6, I will use lead time L=4. This requires mu_hat to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=6 for demand mean (average ~60) results in mu_hat around 300. The current pipeline inventory is 196 (in-transit) + 49 (on-hand) = 245. Given the OR capped policy formula, setting mu_hat based on the recent average demand will trigger a replenishment order to reach the base stock level. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 6 available periods of in-game data to capture the current regime more accurately than the pre-game samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a high-support sports bra. Historical demand shows relative stability with a mean of ~61 units over the last 12 weeks (samples: 81, 48, 71, 68, 74, 56, 60, 54, 65, 52, 70, 63). No significant seasonal trend is yet confirmed for early April based on the data. Carry-over insights confirm the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). Using N=12 for demand parameters captures all available data (5 pre-game + 7 in-game samples) to maintain a stable forecast. Pipeline inventory consists of orders from P4 (56), P6 (55), and P7 (53), totaling 164 units. On-hand is 71. The OR backend will use these to determine the P8 order while accounting for the target base stock (calculated as roughly (L+1)*mean plus safety stock). Service level target is 50% (profit=holding=$1), meaning z=0.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a high-support sports bra, and we are entering the spring season, where interest in fitness apparel typically increases. Demand in the last sample (Period 8) was 81, which is a significant jump from the previous weeks' average (~60). Historical samples from January/February also ranged from 48 to 81, suggesting potential high volatility or a subtle upward trend as the season changes. Promised lead time is 4 periods, and 'Period 8 conclude' confirms the actual lead time is stable at 4 periods (Period 4 order arrived in Period 8). Currently, we have 46 units on hand and 188 units in transit (ordered in Periods 6, 7, and 8). To ensure we cover demand over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the recent uptick while smoothing the noise. The backend will calculate base stock using a q-ratio of 0.5 (Profit $1 / (Profit $1 + Holding $1)), targeting the median demand to balance the high holding cost against potential sales.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a high-support sports bra. Demand has been relatively stable with a recent average around 60-65 units/period, though Period 9 saw a dip to 35. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. In Period 9, no arrival occurred because no order was placed in Period 5 (ordered=0), which is expected. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (11 units) but there are 272 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Specifically, the P6 order (55 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 10 (today), as L=4. Given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (the median), meaning the base stock level should target the expected demand over (L+1) periods. I will use the last 9 samples to capture the historical mean while acknowledging the volatility, setting L=4, mu_hat with recent_N=9, and sigma_hat with recent_N=9.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/4/22), we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10). However, the order placed in Period 5 (ordered=0) resulted in no arrival in Period 9, which is expected. Demand shows a potential regime shift or seasonal softening. Initial demand (P1-P8) averaged 62.6 units. The last two periods (P9-P10) show a significant drop to 34.5 units. Given this is a high-support sports bra, demand may be stabilizing after a spring peak. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining a buffer. Pipeline inventory is healthy (232 units), and on-hand is 32. Setting L to 'calculate' handles the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~63 to ~35 (-44%) over the last two weeks.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) has shown a significant demand drop since Period 9 (late April), coinciding with a possible post-peak period for spring fitness shopping. Average demand has decreased from ~63 (Periods 1-8) to ~34 (Periods 9-11). On-hand inventory is 53, with 198 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which results in a low target service level (q = 0.5), it is critical not to overstock during this lower demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new lower demand average (~34 per week) across the 5-period horizon (L+1), which will signal to the OR backend to restrict further ordering until pipeline inventory clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 9 confirmed: sustained drop in weekly demand from ~63 to ~34 (-46%) over 3 consecutive periods (P9-P11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) has undergone a significant demand regime shift. Periods 1-8 showed an average demand of ~62.6 units. However, since Period 9 (April 8th), demand has plummeted to an average of ~38 units (35, 34, 32, 51). This likely reflects post-New Year fitness resolution seasonality tapering off as we move further into Spring. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P8 order arrived in P12). Current on-hand is 82 units with 118 in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11). Given the high holding cost equal to profit ($1.0), it is critical to lower the base stock to prevent excess inventory. I will use the recent N=4 samples (the current lower demand regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain L at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-72.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated through P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, and P9 arrivals). Demand experienced a significant drop starting in Period 9 (from ~63 units to ~34 units). However, the most recent two periods (P12 and P13) show a slight recovery/stabilization towards 47-51 units. I will prioritize the last 5 periods (P9-P13) to capture this lower but slightly rebounding demand regime (average ~40 units/period). With On-hand inventory at 119 and In-transit at 34 (Total: 153), and a requested L=4 (covering L+1=5 periods of demand), the system is currently overstocked relative to the new demand level (5 periods * 40 units = 200 base stock vs 153 current). I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the OR engine to adapt to this stabilized lower demand while accounting for the high holding cost which equals profit. This will likely result in a small or zero order to burn off current stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~40 units/period over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) following a sharp drop from earlier averages of ~63.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a sports bra with high support. Analysis of the demand history shows a clear regime shift: from P1-P8, the average weekly demand was approximately 62.6 units. Starting at P9 (early April), demand dropped and has stabilized significantly. Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), demand values were 35, 34, 32, 51, 47, and 36, averaging 39.17 units. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, and P14 all reflect a 4-period lag from order to arrival). The on-hand inventory is 98 units, and with 65 units in-transit (P11: 19, P14: 46), the pipeline is healthy compared to the 39-unit demand regime. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand level (39 vs 63) while maintaining a lead time value of 4 via the calculate method.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical data for this high-support sports bra showed a significant regime shift starting in Period 9 (April 2019), where demand dropped from an earlier mean of ~63 to approximately ~40. However, Period 15 showed a sudden spike to 66 units, which may be a outlier or a seasonal pre-summer bump. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (covering Periods 9-15) to capture the lower regime while acknowledging the recent spike, resulting in a more balanced forecast than looking at the entire history. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across multiple data points (P1-P4 and P6-P11 orders). The current on-hand inventory (51) plus in-transit (79) is 130 units, which covers roughly 3 periods of the current demand regime. Given the lead time is 4, additional ordering via the OR backend is appropriate to maintain service levels.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra). Reviewing history, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P8 and P10-P15). However, there is a missing shipment from the Period 12 order which should have arrived in Period 16 conclude; instead, 'arrived=0' was reported for an order expected after 4 periods. Since orders placed in P13, P14, P15, and P16 are still within the promised lead time window, they are not yet overdue. Demand shifted around Period 9 from ~63 to a lower regime. Between P9 and P16 (last 8 periods), the mean demand is 42.25. Recent demand (P15-P16) shows some volatility (66 then 37). I will use a recent window of N=8 to capture this stabilized but slightly volatile post-shift regime. Specifically, mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the mean of ~42.25 per period (multiplied by 1+L by the backend). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current volatility while ignoring the much higher variance from the early weeks. The Lead time (L) is maintained at 'default' (4) as the historical evidence strongly supports this being the operational norm, despite the potential loss/delay of the P12 order.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: Current date June 10, 2019. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has recently averaged around 45 units over the last 5 periods (P13-P17: 47, 36, 66, 37, 40), which is higher than the previously stable level of 40 but lower than the initial average of 63. Critically, shipments from P12 and P13 (0 units ordered) resulted in 0 arrivals in P16 and P17 as expected. However, we have a total of 198 units in-transit (from orders in P14, P15, P16, P17). The order from P14 (46 units) is expected to arrive during P18. Stockout occurred in P17 (14 sold vs 40 demand), so we must ensure future coverage while accounting for the lumpy arrivals inherent in the 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average demand ~45) and sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility (including a high of 66 and low of 37) and L=calculate to stay aligned with the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~45 units/period (P13-P17) following the previous drop-off; volatility remains moderate.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 6 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Period 9, the demand has shifted to a lower regime. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P9-P18) is approximately 42.1, compared to the initial regime average of ~63. Recent periods show a range of 32 to 66. I will use recent_N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting this stable 'lower' regime while capturing recent volatility. Lead time (L) remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent delivery (P14 order arrived P18). The in-transit pipeline (180 units) represents orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18. Given L=4, we expect the P15 order to arrive in P19 resolution and the P16 order in P20 resolution. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current demand distribution and the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P20 (2019/6/24). On-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in P19. There are 170 units in transit. Historical demand analysis shows a stabilizer regime around 45 units/period (P13-P19 avg ~45.7). Recent lead times consistently follow the promised 4 periods (as seen in P18 conclude: P14 order arrived; P19 conclude: P15 order arrived). However, orders from P12 and P13 appear lost or significantly delayed as no arrival was recorded in P16 or P17. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual lead time performance. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=7 (P13-P19) to capture the stabilized demand regime of approx 45.7 units/period, ensuring the base stock level (1+L periods of demand) is calibrated to current consumption rates even while waiting for replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 12 and Period 13 are confirmed as missing/lost (promised lead time 4, now at Period 20 with no arrival).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Demand has recently stabilized after a regime shift, averaging approximately 45.4 units over the last 7 periods (P14-P20), compared to the earlier historical average of ~63. While there was a significant dip to ~35, the most recent 3-5 weeks show demand between 40-55. On-hand inventory is low (13), and while in-transit (166) is theoretically high, we have confirmed that orders from Period 12 and Period 13 are lost. The OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock. Because 0 units were ordered in Periods 12 and 13 (as seen in history), the 'lost' units don't technically exist in the in-transit count. However, the system shows 166 units in-transit, which aligns with orders from P17 (55), P18 (28), P19 (23), and P20 (60) [55+28+23+60=166]. This suggests all recent orders are accounted for and the 'lost' status for P12/P13 is moot as the order quantity was 0. I will set L to 4 (promised) and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand level (avg ~45) and recent volatility, ensuring the OR engine maintains a base stock covering approximately 225 units (5 weeks * 45).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at 45.4 units/period over P14-P20 following the P9 drop; volatility is moderate.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678691002 has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial periods. Since Period 9, demand has averaged approximately 40-45 units per week, following a drop from the previous ~63. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has been 40, 40, 55, 51, and 25, averaging 42.2 units. Volatility remains moderate. Promised lead time is 4 periods, and recent successful arrivals (P14, P15, P16, P17) have consistently arrived with a lead time of 4. Orders from Period 12 and 13 remain missing and are confirmed lost, which effectively decreases the pipeline inventory used in the backend's calculation. To ensure the OR engine targets the current demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=13) to capture samples from Period 9 onwards. For L and sigma_hat, the default settings are appropriate given the stability in lead time and volatility within the new regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) has settled into a lower demand regime since Period 9. Over the last 14 periods (P9-P22), the average demand is 41.3, and over the most recent 7 periods (P16-P22), it is 42.0. The on-hand inventory is 33 units with 141 units in-transit. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods for successful arrivals, but shipments from Period 12 and 13 are officially lost. I am using recent_N (N=14) to capture the demand shift since Period 9. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand. Since the current pipeline is healthy (141 units covering roughly 3+ periods of demand at the new mean), the capped policy will prevent over-ordering while maintaining service levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Carina High Support Bra) is in a stable demand regime after a significant drop around Period 9. Over the last 10 periods (P14-P23), demand has averaged approximately 43.6 units per week, showing moderate volatility. We have confirmed through history that Period 12 and 13 orders were lost, but subsequent orders (P14-P19) have arrived with a consistent lead time of 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (8 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 154 units. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the target service level is q = 0.5, implying the base stock should focus on the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will set L to the promised 4 periods, and use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging ~43.6 units/period) while ignoring the higher demand from the start of the year.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (High Support Bra) exhibits a demand regime that stabilized around Period 9, shifting from an early average of ~63 to approximately 42 units/period (P9-P24 mean). Recent demand has been lower (Avg P21-P24 = 33.75), but given the nature of 'Extra firm support' sports bras, demand is generally steady. Actual lead time has consistently returned to the promised 4 periods (P14 through P20 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). There are no current indications of new missing shipments since P12/P13. With 44 units on-hand and 150 in-transit, we are well-covered. I will use recent_N=16 for mu_hat to capture the post-drop regime (P9-P24) and recent_N=16 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility level. L is set to default as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Historical demand shows a consistent downward trend or stabilization since Period 9. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is approximately 37.6 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) have averaged even lower at 32.8 units. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods for all successful arrivals. Two shipments (P12 and P13) were previously identified as lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 69 units, and in-transit is 108 units (from orders P22-P25: 4+36+56+12=108). Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (the median demand), meaning the OR engine should target the mean demand. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P21-P25) reflects the most recent low-demand regime. This helps avoid excessive holding costs as the sport bra category may be exiting a peak summer demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at approximately 33 units/period over P21-P25, lower than the previous ~45 average observed in P14-P20.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Carina High Support Bra (SKU 678691002) has entered a new lower-demand regime. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P21-P26) shows an average demand of approximately 33 units per period (25, 38, 48, 24, 29, 34), with P23 being an outlier. This is a significant drop from the ~45 average observed between P14-P20. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P22 order in P26. Given equal profit and holding costs, the OR backend aims for a 50% service level. I am using recent_N=6 to capture this lower volume regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Pipeline inventory (104) plus current on-hand (39) total 143 units, which covers approximately 4.3 periods of current demand (143/33), roughly aligning with the L+1 coverage requirement.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a high-support sports bra with a profit-to-holding cost ratio of 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. The current date is 2019/08/19. Analysis of demand shows a settled regime since Period 21 with a mean of approximately 34.4 units (P21: 25, P22: 38, P23: 48, P24: 24, P25: 29, P26: 34, P27: 57). The spike in Period 27 (57 units) may be a pre-fall seasonal uptick. Actual lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods despite the historical loss of shipments from Period 12 and 13. I am setting L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the demand regime starting from P21, which includes the recent spike while maintaining a stable average (avg ~36.4). Sigma_hat will also use N=7 to reflect the moderate current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 has stabilized at an average of ~36 units/period (P21-P27), showing a recent slight increase in volatility compared to earlier periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 21-28) is stabilizing at an average of approximately 35.3 units/period (25, 38, 48, 24, 29, 34, 57, 27). Although volatility has increased slightly in recent weeks, the overall level remains lower than early-game peaks. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods for all successfully delivered shipments (P14-P24). On-hand inventory is 47, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 91 (Orders from P25: 12, P27: 22, P28: 57). Shipments from P12 and P13 remain lost. To compute the order for Period 29, I will use a 4-period lead time and set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the stabilized lower demand level of approximately 35 units/period. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 8 periods to reflect the slightly higher recent variance.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a high-support sports bra with steady demand. Analysis of recent history shows demand has stabilized following a regime shift from ~45 to ~36 units per period starting around Period 21. Over the last 9 periods (P21-P29), the mean demand is 34.7 units with a standard deviation of 12.0. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (orders from P21-P25 arrived exactly in 4 periods), although history shows sporadic lost shipments in the past (P12, P13). Current on-hand inventory is 28 units, and in-transit inventory is 118 units (Orders from P26: 0, P27: 22, P28: 57, P29: 39). The OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (\u03bc\u0302). However, the cap protects against over-ordering. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the current demand regime (P21-P29).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 following a stockout in Period 30 where demand (41) exceeded starting inventory (28). An arrival was expected in Period 30 (ordered in Period 26), but 'Period 30 conclude' shows arrived=0, and the order from Period 26 is still in-transit. This marks a potential lead time extension or delay for specifically the Period 26 order. The demand regime from Period 21-30 has averaged 36.4 units/period with moderate volatility. I will use recent_N=10 to reflect this current demand regime. For lead time, I will stick with 'calculate' to incorporate historical performance, acknowledging the current delay might be localized. The pipeline inventory (146) is relatively high, but with 0 on-hand units and 4-period lead times, maintained coverage is essential.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Shipment from Period 26 is delayed (expected arrival Period 30, but arrived=0). Demand regime P21-P30 stabilized at an average of 36.4 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we are facing an inventory stock-out (On-hand: 0). History shows that the shipment from Period 26 (expected in Period 30) is likely lost or significantly delayed, as we are now in Period 31's conclusion data and it has not arrived. However, the shipment from Period 27 arrived on schedule (LT=4) in Period 31. This confirms the lead time is still effectively 4 periods for successful shipments. Demand has stabilized into a regime starting around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 31, mean demand is approximately 35.5 units (sum=391 / 11 periods). We will use recent_N=11 to capture this specific regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will target using these parameters. We will keep L at default (4) as the calculation method remains consistent with observed successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 26 is confirmed lost (exceeded promised lead time + 1 period with no arrival, while subsequent Period 27 order has arrived). Demand regime P21-P31 is stable at 35.5 units/period.

678691002: ordered=19, arrived=57 units (ordered on Period 28, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=57, demand=16, sold=16, ending on-hand inventory=41

Daily Reward (R_t): $-25.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Carina High Support Bra has stabilized around an average of 35.5 units per period over the most recent 12 weeks (P21-P32), with Period 32 showing a lower demand of 16. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms actual lead times consistently meet this (as seen in P31 and P32 arrivals), despite the lost shipment from Period 26. In Period 32, we had an arrival of 57 units (ordered P28), leaving us with 41 on-hand units. However, current in-transit inventory (117) includes orders from Period 29 (39 units), Period 30 (28 units), Period 31 (31 units), and Period 32 (19 units). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (P21-P32) while smoothing out the recent lower demand of 16 in Period 32. L is set to 'default' as the lead time has consistently been 4 periods for all non-lost shipments.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Carina High Support Bra (678691002) has been in a stable regime since Period 21, averaging approximately 34.6 units per period (P21-P33). Although Period 33 saw a spike to 54 units, the overall average remains consistent with the established lower-demand level observed throughout late summer and early autumn. The Lead Time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P31, P32, and P33), despite the loss of the Period 26 shipment. Current on-hand inventory is 26, plus 86 units in-transit (orders from P30, P31, P32, P33). I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering P21-P33) to capture the current stable demand regime and its associated volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level tailored to the current 34.6 units/period average while accounting for recent variation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 is confirmed stable at an average of 34.6 units/period (P21-P33) despite occasional single-period spikes.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 21 to Period 34 is stable, averaging 34.3 units per period (sample: 25, 38, 48, 24, 29, 34, 57, 27, 31, 41, 27, 16, 54, 30). Although there was a spike in Period 33 (54 units), it was followed by a return to 30 in Period 34. Current on-hand inventory is 24, with 113 units in transit. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods, with the exception of the lost shipment from Period 26 (confirmed lost in Period 32). Orders from Period 31, 32, 33, and 34 are currently in the pipeline. I will continue using a 14-period window (N=14) for both demand and lead-time calculations to reflect the stable regime since Period 21, which helps smooth out occasional spikes while accurately capturing the current lower mean compared to earlier in the year.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. The product is a high-support sports bra, which typically sees stable demand but may experience variations due to seasonal fitness trends. Analyzing the demand history, a regime shift was identified around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 35, the average demand is approximately 33.1 units per period (sum=497, N=15). The most recent few periods (P32-P35) show lower demand (16, 54, 30, 12), averaging 28 units, suggesting a possible slight downward drift or volatility. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat to capture the current stable regime since P21. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=15 to capture the volatility of this regime. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (excluding occasional lost shipments like P26), so I will use the 'default' promised lead time. Inventory check: On-hand is 43, In-transit is 117 (from orders P32, P33, P34, P35). Total pipeline is 160. Given L=4, base stock covers 5 periods of demand (~165 units). The current position is nearly sufficient, so the OR backend will calculate a small or zero order to maintain the target service level.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) has shown a sustained decrease in the most recent periods. While the regime starting at Period 21 averaged ~34.6 units, the last several periods (P32-P36) have shown even lower demand (16, 54, 30, 12, 19), with a 5-week average of 26.2. Given that this is a sports bra and we are entering late October, a seasonal dip is plausible. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this recent lower-demand regime (N=5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P27-P32 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). There are no currently missing shipments to account for; the pipeline inventory of 103 units, combined with the current on-hand of 43, is sufficient to meet forecasted demand (L+1 = 5 periods) at the current rate of ~26 units/period (total need ~130). Parameters are set to maintain a service level balance where profit equals holding cost (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected starting Period 32: Average demand decreased from ~35 to ~26 (-25%) over the last 5 periods (P32-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P38 (2019/10/28). Demand has significantly shifted since P32, dropping from a stable mean of ~35 units to approximately 26 units (P32-P37: 16, 54, 30, 12, 19, 17; mean = 24.6). The spike in P33 (54) appears to be an outlier in this new regime. On-hand inventory is 34, with 95 units in-transit (orders from P34: 55, P35: 35, and P36: 5). With a lead time of 4, the P34 order (55 units) is expected to arrive during P38 and be visible in P39, which will adequately cover demand given the lower regime. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P32 order arrived P36, P33 order arrived P37). I will set L to 'default' (4) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (P32-P37) to capture the current lower demand trend while maintaining safety stock for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 32 confirmed: Average demand decreased to ~25 units/period (P32-P37) from previous ~35 average.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the high-support sports bra (678691002) has entered a lower-demand regime starting Period 32. Over the last 7 periods (P32-P38), demand has averaged 26.0 units, significantly lower than the ~35 units observed in the preceding period. Current on-hand inventory is 55 units with 40 units in-transit (ordered P35-P36). Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods, with the P34 order arriving exactly as expected in P38. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should target the mean demand. With 95 units total inventory (55 on-hand + 40 in-transit) and a forecast for the (L+1=5) period window of approximately 130 units (5 * 26), the system will likely place a small replenishment order. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime while maintaining moderate volatility estimates.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are managing a high-support sports bra. A significant demand drop occurred around Period 32 (mid-September), where demand shifted from an average of ~35 units to ~25 units per period. The most recent demand (P32-P39) averages 25.875 units. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods for all recent successful deliveries. The pipeline inventory is currently 40 units (orders from P36, P39), and on-hand inventory is 65. The backend OR logic will use recent_N=8 to capture this lower demand regime (P32-P39). Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=8 will reflect this lower baseline (~26 units/period). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture current volatility. No new shipments are confirmed lost since the Period 26 incident.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-18.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Carina High Support Bra has entered a lower-volume regime starting around Period 32. Analyzing demand from P32 to P40, the average is 21.4 units/period (16, 54, 30, 12, 19, 17, 34, 25, 26), which is significantly lower than previous averages (~35). While Period 33 was a spike (54), the overall trend is consistent with the lower forecast noted in the carry-over insights. I will set N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime (P32-P40). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent conclusive arrivals from Periods 35 and 36 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The on-hand inventory of 44 and in-transit of 60 (orders from P39, P40) are being managed by the OR backend to align with this lower demand forecast while balancing the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), implying a target service level of 50% before considerations for safety stock and lead time coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 32 has stabilized at an average of 21.4 units/period over the last 9 periods (P32-P40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting Period 32 (P32-P41) has stabilized at an average of 22.3 units/period (223 total/10 periods), confirming a significant drop from previous averages. The 'In-transit' balance of 86 units consists of orders from P37 (0 units), P38 (0 units), P39 (35 units), P40 (25 units), and P41 (26 units). Based on the 4-period lead time, no arrival was expected in Period 41 (from P37 ordering 0), but the P35 order of 35 units arrived in P39 and P36 order of 5 units arrived in P40, both maintaining the 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 14. We now set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect the 22.3 avg demand across the lead time + current period (L+1=5). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to capture current volatility. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 4 periods as recent arrivals (P39, P40) follow this pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 32 has stabilized at an average of 22.3 units/period (P32-P41), down from previous regime (~35 units).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

In Period 42, we observed a significant demand spike of 123 units. Given the date (2019/11/25), this clearly corresponds to the Black Friday/Cyber Monday retail week. Our current demand regime (since P32) had averaged ~22 units, making this a massive outlier. For Period 43 (Dec 2), we expect demand to remain higher than the pre-spike average due to continued holiday shopping, but likely lower than the peak Black Friday volume. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 118 units in-transit. To avoid over-correcting for a one-time event while still protecting against holiday seasonality, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=11 (dating back to P32) to capture the base regime while being influenced by the recent spike. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' to account for the significantly increased volatility introduced by the 123-unit demand period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical consistency.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand leaped to 123 units (up from ~22 avg) due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday timing.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (2019/12/09). A significant demand spike (123 units) occurred in Period 42, which matches the Black Friday/Cyber Monday shopping period for sports bras. The demand in Period 43 returned to a more normal level (22 units). Given the high demand in Period 42 and the fact that we are approaching the end of the game (Period 47), we must ensure sufficient inventory for any lingering holiday demand or potential end-of-year clearance effects. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (e.g., Period 39 order arriving in Period 43). mu_hat should account for the recent post-spike stabilization while acknowledging that Period 42 was an outlier. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (covering the regime from Period 32 to 43) to capture the base demand while reflecting the high volatility introduced by the holiday spike.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization: Demand returned to 22 units in P43 following the P42 spike of 123. The regime P32-P43 maintains an average demand of 30.7 units/period with significantly increased variance due to the outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-20.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history is heavily skewed by the Period 42 Black Friday spike (123 units). Post-holiday demand has normalized quickly: P43 (22 units) and P44 (9 units). For Period 45 (mid-December), we expect low to moderate demand before any pre-Christmas or year-end activity. Using a 3-period window (N=3) for mu_hat (P42-P44) results in a high forecast (~51 per period) due to the spike; using N=13 (since P32) averages to ~30. However, the most recent non-spike average (P32-P41) was ~22. Given the game is near its end (P45 of 47) and we have significant inventory in-transit (132 units), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P40-P44) to capture the spike while remaining cautious. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since holding cost equals profit ($1/$1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level, essentially aiming for the median demand. A higher sigma_hat is necessary to account for the extreme volatility introduced by the holiday spike.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization: P44 demand dropped to 9 units. Seasonal volatility remains high due to recent extreme outlier (P42, 123 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late December (Period 46, Dec 23). Historical demand shows extreme volatility due to the holiday season: Period 42 (Black Friday) saw 123 units, and Period 45 just recorded a massive spike of 211 units, likely due to pre-Christmas shopping. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 155 units (from orders P42-P45), but these will not arrive for several periods. Given the high volatility and stockout in P45, the priority is to rebuild inventory to cover the remaining holiday tail and early January demand. The most recent demand regime (P32-P45) is heavily skewed by outliers (211, 123). Using a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat captures this entire high-volatility window. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=14 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed holiday variance, effectively raising the base stock level to prevent further stockouts during this peak season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed: Period 45 saw a significant spike to 211 units (pre-Christmas), following the Period 42 spike of 123 units (Black Friday). Current inventory is depleted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) is experiencing extreme seasonal holiday demand. Period 42 (Black Friday) saw 123 units, Period 45 (Pre-Christmas) saw 211 units, and Period 46 saw 185 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 193 units in-transit. Date is 2019/12/30; we expect a sharp post-holiday drop-off as January begins, typical for retail cycles following the gifting season, although 'New Year, New Me' fitness resolutions may keep sports bra demand slightly higher than the pre-holiday floor of ~22 units. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 250 (50 units/period * 5) to account for the (L+1) window, balancing the recent extreme peaks with the expected seasonal cooling. Sigma_hat is set high using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatility and maintain a high service level to recover from stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization expected after Period 46: Demand peaked with holiday spikes of 123 (P42), 211 (P45), and 185 (P46). January demand likely to stabilize above pre-holiday levels (~22) due to fitness seasonality but significantly below December peaks.
