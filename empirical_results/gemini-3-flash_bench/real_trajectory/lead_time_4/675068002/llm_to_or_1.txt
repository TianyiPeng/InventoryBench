Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Straight-cut shirt' in a cotton weave, which is a staple apparel item ('Womens Everyday Collection'). Current inventory is zero. Historical demand shows a slight upward trend over the last 5 weeks: [41, 41, 41, 47, 51], with a mean of 44.2. As we approach the spring season (February/March), demand for lighter cotton shirts typically increases. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Since we have no historical lead time arrivals yet, I will use L=4. Given the clear upward momentum in the last two weeks, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the shift from the stable 41s to the higher 47-51 range. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on (1+4) * mean(41, 47, 51) = 5 * 46.33 = 231.65. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock sufficient to cover the lead time plus the review period demand during this emerging spring uptrend.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's cotton blouse. In Period 1, we experienced a significant demand spike (158 units) compared to the pre-game historical samples (avg ~44). This spike resulted in 158 units of lost sales because on-hand inventory was 0. We currently have 55 units in-transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, this order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Given the sudden increase in demand, I will adjust mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture the most recent high demand signal (158), which is significantly higher than the previous samples. For the lead time L, I will remain at the 'default' promised 4 periods as we have no evidence yet of a deviation. For sigma_hat, I will use 'explicit' to provide a conservative volatility estimate given the sudden regime shift, as the standard deviation of only a few points would be unreliable.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand (pre-game) was stable around 41-51 units. However, in Period 1 and 2, demand exploded to 158 and 392 respectively. This suggests a significant regime shift or seasonal peak (e.g., Spring collection launch). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 250 units in-transit (55 from P1, 195 from P2). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible P6). No arrivals have occurred yet, which is consistent with L=4. Given the massive demand spike, the historical mean is no longer relevant. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the new high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will force the OR engine to calculate a much higher base stock to meet the new demand levels, even with high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 1: demand increased from ~45 to 158 (+250%), then to 392 in Period 2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product (Womens Everyday Blouse) entered a high-demand regime starting Period 1, likely due to spring seasonality/new collection launch. Historical demand for the last 3 periods is 158, 392, and 359 (average ~303). Promised lead time is 4 periods. The earliest order (Period 1) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 5 and visible in Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 798 in-transit (55 + 195 + 548). To cover demand during lead time (L) plus the review period (1), we need to set mu_hat for (1+4)=5 periods. Using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat captures the 303 average, which the OR engine will multiply by (1+L). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the high volatility seen in the transition from P1 to P2/P3. L is kept at default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead time shift.

Carry-over insight: Established high-demand regime (Avg ~303/period) starting Period 1 vs. pre-game levels (~44/period).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a women's cotton blouse, which saw a demand regime shift starting in Period 1 (averaging ~293 units/period over the last 4 weeks compared to ~44 pre-game). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed Period 1) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since it was placed in the P1 decision phase, L=4 means it should arrive during P5's arrival resolution phase and be visible at the start of P6. Thus, the inventory gap is expected until next period. Total in-transit is 1310 (P1:55 + P2:195 + P3:548 + P4:512). I will set L to the promised 4 periods as we haven't confirmed any arrivals yet. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a moving average of the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the high-demand regime (Avg: 293). The OR backend will compute the base stock for (L+1)=5 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to capture the high volatility seen in the new regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product is a cotton blouse, which experienced a high-demand regime relative to pre-game data (~273 avg vs ~44 pre-game). We have confirmation that the lead time is indeed 4 periods (Period 1 order of 55 arrived in Period 5). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing high demand, we need to maintain a strong pipeline. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 periods and use the history from Period 1 to Period 5 to forecast demand (N=5). The mean demand over these 5 periods is approximately 273 units per period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~1365 units). Our current in-transit is 1410, so the system is well-buffered to recover once shipments arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $163.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 1 order arrived in P5; Period 2 order arrived in P6). Demand has stabilized after an initial surge. The regime shift starting in Period 1 shows demand values of 158, 392, 359, 263, 192, and 179. The mean across these 6 periods is approximately 257. However, the last three periods (P4-P6) show a cooling trend (263, 192, 179) with an average of 211. Since the product is a 'Straight-cut shirt in an airy cotton weave', it is highly relevant for the spring season (late March). We currently have 16 units on hand and 1,215 in transit (mostly from large orders in P3 and P4). To avoid over-ordering as earlier large shipments arrive, I will use a N=5 window for mu_hat to capture the current demand level while smoothing the peak, and set sigma_hat using the same window to reflect recent volatility. Lead time remains at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued and started declining from Period 2 peak (392), averaging ~211 over the last 3 periods (P4-P6). Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-2.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1st) shows the product is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' cotton shirt. Demand peaked in Period 2 (392) and has since trended downward, settling into a lower range (average of last 3 periods: 217). The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7. Currently, on-hand inventory is 283 and in-transit is 821, following a large arrival of 548 units from the Period 3 order. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to support demand for L+1=5 periods. The historical demand data provided (Jan/Feb) reflects pre-season levels, while gameplay periods (Feb-Mar) show a high-season spike that is now tapering. I will use a recent_N (N=4) Window to capture the declining 'post-peak' demand trend (averaging ~228 per period) while maintaining the default lead time. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 0.50 (the median). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 will result in about 1140 total demand (5 * ~228), and with in-transit + on-hand already at ~1100, the OR backend will place smaller orders to avoid excessive holding costs as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand decay: Average demand dropped from ~303 (P1-P4) to ~228 (P4-P7) as the spring transition concludes.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on arrivals from P1-P4. Current on-hand inventory is 436 units, and in-transit is 349 (P5: 155, P6: 0, P7: 154, P8: 40). Demand in Period 8 spiked to 359, likely due to pre-Easter shopping (Easter was April 21, 2019), contradicting the previous decay trend. For women's blouses, we anticipate sustained demand through late spring. To avoid the stockouts seen in P1-P5, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period window (P5-P8) to capture this volatility. N=4 yields an average demand of 252.75 per period. Since L=4, mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 5 * 252.75 = 1263.75. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N=4 window to capture the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P8 (359 vs. ~211 avg in P4-P7), potentially signaling a secondary spring/pre-Easter peak.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a cotton shirt, which historically shows strong spring demand. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods (P5-P9 arrivals all matched the 4-period promise). Demand has been volatile: after an initial peak (P1-P3), it settled (~211 in P4-P7), but then spiked again in P8 (359) before dipping in P9 (215). This pattern suggests a sustained but fluctuating spring demand regime. With 376 units on-hand and 586 in-transit (orders from P7-P9), we must maintain coverage for (L+1)=5 periods. Given the volatility, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current spring mean demand (~265) while allowing the OR backend to account for the increased standard deviation observed in the last few cycles.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand volatility confirmed (P8 spike to 359 followed by P9 dip to 215); 5-period average (P5-P9) is 245 units compared to pre-game ~45.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd, 2019. This coincides with the week after Easter Sunday (April 21st, 2019). Historical demand for this 'Straight-cut cotton shirt' showed a significant spring surge (P1-P4) peaking at 392, followed by a stabilization period (P5-P10) averaging 232 units. The most recent demand (P10) was 173, suggesting a post-holiday cooldown. However, the period P5-P9 showed volatility (ranging from 179 to 359). A lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by deliveries from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5. In P10, no order arrived as none was placed in P6, which is consistent with the Lead Time. For P11, we expect the arrival of the order from P7 (154 units). The current on-hand inventory is 203. The pipeline (in-transit) is 850, covering the next 4 periods. I will use a 6-period window (P5-P10) for demand estimation to capture the post-peak spring level (Average: 233, Std Dev: 69). Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat accordingly ensures the OR backend targets a service level balanced against holding costs, especially as we move past the Easter peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 29, 2019 (Period 12). Period 11 demand was 160, continuing a downward trend from the early spring peak in February/March. The last four periods (P8-P11) have seen demands of 359, 215, 173, and 160, averaging ~227. However, the last two weeks suggest demand is stabilizing around 160-170 units as the peak spring season transitions into late spring. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P7 order arrived in P11). Note: The P6 order (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrival message in P10, which explains the 'arrived=0' observation then. In-transit inventory (809 units) is quite high relative to current demand, consisting of orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent deceleration, and sigma_hat using the same period to account for the P8 volatility while acknowledging the lower recent volume. This will prevent over-ordering as the season cools.

Carry-over insight: Post-spring peak demand stabilization: Demand has declined from a peak of ~392 (P2) to a relative floor of ~160-170 (P10-P11). Sustained lead time of 4 periods confirmed.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th. The product is a women's cotton blouse, which experienced a significant spring peak from late February through early April (Periods 1-8). Demand has since stabilized and declined, with the most recent demand at 111 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P10-P12) is 148 units, significantly lower than the season-high peaks. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory position is high (On-hand: 126, In-transit: 897), and the demand regime is in a post-peak cooling phase, I am using a recent window (N=5) to reflect the current lower demand level while maintaining enough coverage to avoid stockouts if demand fluctuates slightly during late spring.

Carry-over insight: Post-spring peak demand cooling: demand has dropped from a peak of 392 to an average of ~148 over the last 3 periods (P10-P12).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-360.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). We are observing a significant and sustained cooling in demand for this item (Womens Everyday Collection cotton shirt), which likely saw its peak during the spring/Easter window. Demand has dropped steadily from a high of 392 (P2) and 359 (P8) to the double digits for the first time in Period 13 (79). The last 4 periods (P10-P13) show demand of 173, 160, 111, and 79 respectively. This indicates a downward regime shift. Current on-hand inventory (439) and in-transit (505) are high relative to this cooling demand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent decay and prevent over-ordering while the system works through existing stock. A profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1 suggests a target service level of 50%, so the backend will aim to minimize excess inventory as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed cooling demand regime for mid-May: 4-period average (P10-P13) dropped to 130.75 vs early spring average of ~250. Seasonal peak is concluded.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), the demand for the cotton blouse (SKU 675068002) is in a significant cooling phase following the spring peak. The last four periods (P11-P14) show a clear downward trend (160, 111, 79, 87), with a 4-period average of 109.25 units. This is a sharp decline from the earlier spring average of ~250. Our current inventory position is high: On-hand is 616 units, and there are 241 units in-transit (orders from P11 and P12, with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods). Total pipeline + on-hand is 857 units, which at the current demand rate of ~100/period, covers over 8 weeks of inventory\u2014far exceeding the target stock level (L+1 = 5 weeks). Consequently, the OR engine should not place new orders. To reflect the transition into summer and the end of the spring peak, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period window (N=4) to capture the lower current demand mean, and using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 11: Mean demand cooled from ~250 to ~109 (-56%) as spring peak concluded. High inventory levels relative to current demand suggest an overstocked position.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for this airy cotton blouse has significantly cooled after the spring peak (Feb-Apr), with demand averaging ~96 units over the last 3 periods (P13-P15). The current on-hand inventory of 623 units is more than sufficient to cover approximately 6 periods of demand at these current levels, even before considering the in-transit inventory of 128 units (ordered P12, expected to arrive this period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given that the profit margin equals the holding cost (z-score will be 0, aiming for a 50% service level target by the OR backend), and we are heavily overstocked relative to the current cooling trend, I will use a short-window (recent_N=5) to reflect the lower demand regime and allow inventory to bleed down without placing new orders. Mu_hat will be set to (1+L) * mean of recent 5 periods (P11-P15), which matches the post-peak stabilization.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is an 'airy cotton weave' shirt, which saw its seasonal spring peak from P1-P4 (avg ~293) and is now in a sustained cooling/stabilization phase for early summer. Current demand (P13-P16) averages 85.75 units per period. On-hand inventory is 680 units with 0 in-transit. With a 4-period lead time, we must cover 5 periods of demand (current + lead time). At current levels, we need approximately 429 units (5 * 85.75). Since on-hand (680) significantly exceeds this requirement, the OR backend's capped policy will result in zero orders, which is appropriate to reduce holding costs. Parameters are set to reflect the most recent regime (P13-P16) to ensure the base stock calculation accurately mirrors the lower seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand stabilization confirmed starting Period 13: demand has leveled off to an average of ~86 units (P13-P16) following the spring peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The SKU (a cotton blouse) has transitioned from its peak spring demand (Period 2-3) into a significantly lower summer regime. Demand has continued to decline, reaching a series low of 46 units in Period 17. The current on-hand inventory of 634 units is extremely high, covering approximately 7-8 periods of demand at the recent average (~83 units/period for P13-P17). With a 4-period lead time, no new orders are required. The strategy is to let the existing inventory bleed down to reduce mounting holding costs. Parameters are updated to reflect the lower demand regime (~83 mean) and lower volatility observed in early summer to prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 13: Average demand decreased to ~83 units/period (P13-P17) from the previous cooling phase of ~130. Inventory is currently in an overstocked state with 7.6 weeks of coverage.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for this summer blouse (675068002) has significantly declined following the spring peak, establishing a new low-demand regime. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P13-P18) reveals a mean demand of 72 units per period (79, 87, 106, 71, 46, 43), with a noticeable further drop in the most recent two weeks to ~45 units. The current on-hand inventory is 591 units, which provides approximately 8-13 weeks of coverage given the current demand levels. There is zero inventory in transit. With the promised lead time of 4 periods and a profit margin equal to the holding cost (1.0 vs 1.0, targeting a 50% service level base stock), the system is significantly overstocked. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to define the current demand regime, as it captures the post-peak stabilization. The high on-hand stock combined with the low parameter targets will naturally result in zero orders until the inventory position normalizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: demand has dropped further to an average of ~45 units/period (P17-P18) from the early summer average of ~86 units. Current inventory (591) remains extremely high for the current demand environment.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues in a sustained low-demand regime characteristic of post-peak early summer. Current demand is averaging 54.3 units (Periods 17-19: 46, 43, 74). This is significantly lower than the previous regime (Avg ~86 in P13-P16) and the spring peak. On-hand inventory is 517 units with zero units in-transit. At the current demand rate, the on-hand stock covers nearly 10 weeks of supply. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistently verified by historical arrivals (L=4). To minimize holding costs while the overstock clears, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3-period average (N=3) to reflect the current low floor and keep sigma_hat based on recent volatility. This will result in a base stock lower than on-hand, suppressing new orders (backend capped policy) until inventory levels are better aligned with the current seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: demand has stabilized at a low summer floor, averaging ~54 units/period (P17-P19), down from the early-summer average of ~86 units. Current inventory of 517 units represents over 9 periods of coverage.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a low summer floor, averaging 55.5 units/period over the last 4 periods (P17-P20), which is significantly lower than the spring peak of ~300. Current on-hand inventory is 458 units with 0 units in-transit. Given a demand of roughly 55 units/period, the current stock provides over 8 weeks of coverage, far exceeding the 5-week 'review + lead time' window (L=4). Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, meaning the base stock should ideally equal median demand. With such high inventory, the OR backend's capped policy will naturally result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current low-demand summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor confirmed for July: 4-period average (P17-P20) stabilized at 55.5 units/period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '675068002' (Women's Blouse) has transitioned from a high spring demand peak (Feb-Apr) into a stable summer floor. Demand over the last five periods (P17-P21) has averaged 58.4 units per period (46, 43, 74, 59, 70). Current on-hand inventory is 388 units with no units in-transit. At the current demand rate, the current stock provides over 6 periods of coverage (388 / 58 \u2248 6.6), which significantly exceeds the combined review and lead time (1+4=5). Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the optimal base stock (mu_hat) should target the median demand. My objective is to allow the on-hand inventory to naturally deplete towards this lower target to minimize holding costs. I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P17-P21) to capture the current stable summer regime (~58 units/period, target total ~290). Since 388 > 290, the OR backend will correctly compute an order of 0 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/15 (Period 23). The product is a women's cotton blouse, currently in a low-demand summer floor. Demand has stabilized significantly since the spring peak (which reached 392 units). The 6-period average (P17-P22) is 57.5 units, showing remarkable stability compared to previous volatility. On-hand inventory is 335 units, which covers approximately 5.8 periods of the current demand rate at a holding cost of $1.00/unit/period. Since the profit is also $1.00/unit, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we should aim to carry inventory equivalent to roughly one period of demand beyond lead time if demand were perfectly stable, or slightly more to cover variance. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1 (total 5 periods), the current inventory of 335 is more than sufficient. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this summer floor (Periods 17-22), and L to 'calculate' to reflect the historically stable 4-period lead time. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend due to the high existing stock relative to demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained low-demand summer regime (Period 17 onwards), averaging approximately 54 units per period (P17-P23 range: 26-74). The most recent observation (P23) shows a further drop to 26 units. On-hand inventory is 309 units, which at the current 7-period average (53.6 units/period) provides over 5.7 weeks of coverage. With a 4-period lead time, the current inventory level is more than sufficient to cover the total lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from placing an order, I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and use the 'recent_N' method for lead time and standard deviation to accurately capture the reduced volatility and stable delivery performance.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor has further softened: average demand for the last 3 periods (P21-P23) dropped to 49.7 units compared to the previous 4-period average of 55.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-279.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (cotton blouse) is in a late-summer clearance phase with demand significantly declining as the season concludes. Demand in Period 24 hit a series low of 15 units. The 3-period average (P22-P24) is 31 units, while the 5-period average (P20-P24) is 44.6 units. Given the current on-hand inventory of 294 units and zero in-transit, the inventory covers nearly 10 weeks of current demand levels. With holding costs equal to profit ($1.00), minimizing inventory is crucial. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to capture the latest demand softening while allowing the OR backend to continue clearing the existing surplus without placing new orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand collapse confirmed: 4-period average (P21-P24) dropped to 41 units, with Period 24 reaching a low of 15 units. SKU is severely overstocked (7.1x current monthly demand).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. The SKU is a 'Straight-cut shirt in an airy cotton weave', which is typically a spring/summer seasonal item. We are currently in a late-summer demand decay phase. Over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), demand has averaged 37.2 units, significantly lower than the early summer average (~86) or spring peak (>300). Demand in Period 24 hit a seasonal low of 15 units, with a minor bounce to 22 in Period 25. On-hand inventory is 272 units, which provides approximately 7.3 periods of coverage based on the latest 5-period average. Since 272 is far higher than any reasonable base stock level calculated from current demand and a 4-period lead time (expected base stock would be around 200-250 units even with a high service level), the OR engine will naturally produce an order of 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the system target reflects the seasonal decline and avoids triggering unneeded orders as stock slowly depletes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product is a women's blouse, which has experienced a significant seasonal decline from its spring peak (avg ~250) to a summer floor. Recent demand from P21-P26 has been very low, averaging 36 units per period (70, 53, 26, 15, 22, 30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 242 units with zero in-transit. With a 4-period lead time, the inventory position covers over 6 periods of demand at current rates (242 / 36 \u2248 6.7). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should only hold enough to cover the median expected demand. Given the clear downward trend and the fact that we are in the late summer 'off-season' for this item, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (P21-P26) to reflect this lower regime. The current overstock situation means the backend will naturally place zero orders (cap and base stock will be below current inventory).

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand regime (P21-P26) confirmed: demand has stabilized at a low floor averaging ~36 units/period, down from the early summer average of ~55.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a late-summer low-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 36 units per period over the last 7 weeks (P21-P27). The current date is August 19, 2019. The on-hand inventory is 209 units, which covers nearly 6 periods of current demand, well beyond the promised lead time of 4 periods. Consequently, no new orders are required. The OR target should be set to reflect this lower demand floor to prevent unnecessary ordering. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand period (P21-P27). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The product is a women's blouse, and historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high spring peak followed by a long, steady decline through the summer. Demand has now settled into a very low late-summer regime. Over the last 4 periods (P25-P28), demand has averaged 26.25 units (22, 30, 33, 20). On-hand inventory is 189 units with no units in transit. Using the (L+1) logic for a promised lead time of 4, the target pipeline should cover 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~26 units/period, the required inventory is roughly 130 units. Since 189 units are on-hand, we are still overstocked and do not need to place an order. I will set the parameters to reflect this low-demand regime (N=8 to capture the stabilization starting around P21) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation remains below current on-hand levels, preventing unnecessary ordering and minimizing further holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Blouse) has entered a late-summer/pre-autumn floor, with an average demand of approximately 27.5 units per period over the last 6 periods (P24-P29). The on-hand inventory is 160 units, which covers nearly 6 periods of demand at the current rate (160 / 27.5 \u2248 5.8). Since the lead time is 4 periods, the current inventory already covers the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR engine from triggering an order due to historical high-demand averages from the spring peak, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 6 to reflect the current low-demand regime and setting L to calculate to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed in history.

Carry-over insight: Late summer/Early autumn floor confirmed (P24-P29): Demand has stabilized at an average of ~27.5 units/period, down from the mid-summer average of ~55. On-hand inventory remains sufficient for the current demand rate.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a late summer/early autumn period with a stabilized low demand regime. Over the last seven periods (P24-P30), demand has averaged 26.1 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 6.5. This confirms the 'Late summer/Early autumn floor' identified in the carry-over insights. Current on-hand inventory is 126 units with 0 units in transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 31 (current) plus the 4 periods of lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). With a mean demand of ~26 units, our target inventory (base stock) would be roughly 130-150 units. Since on-hand is 126 and there is no pipeline, we are slightly below the ideal safety stock level but very close to the expected demand coverage. I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture this stable autumn floor for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default promised lead time of 4. This will likely trigger a small replenishment order to align inventory with the (L+1) demand window and provide a small safety buffer against volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a low autumn floor, with the last 8 periods (P24-P31) averaging 25.875 units. Period 30 and 31 both had consistently low demand of 34 units. The SKU has 92 units on-hand, which covers roughly 3.5 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since inventory is finally approaching a level where an order might be triggered by the OR backend, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N (N=8) to capture the current stable floor of ~26 units/period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=8) to account for the low volatility in this regime. This ensures that the system maintains a lean inventory as we move further into autumn, avoiding the high holding costs seen throughout the summer.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is a women's blouse, which typically experiences a secondary demand peak during the autumn (September/October) transition. Over the last 9 periods (P24-P32), demand has stabilized at a low floor averaging 27.4 units/period, with very low volatility (std \u2248 6.4). On-hand inventory is 62 units, and pipeline inventory is 44 units (ordered P31, P32), totaling 106 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 33 through 37 (5 periods). Using the recent average of 27.4 units/period, required inventory is approximately 137 units plus safety stock. The inventory position (106) is slightly below the expected 5-period demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the current stable floor while leaning on the OR engine's safety stock logic (sigma_hat) to manage risks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September/early October. Demand spiked in Period 33 to 65 units, which is a significant increase from the previous average of ~30. This likely signals an early autumn seasonal uplift for long-sleeved blouses as temperatures drop. Current on-hand inventory is 0, with 76 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the first replenishment (5 units from P31) is expected to arrive in Period 35, leaving Period 34 at risk of stockout. Given the recent demand jump, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the upward trend (P30-P33 avg: 40.75) while adjusting for the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this recent period to reflect increased volatility. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent 4-period historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand uplift detected: Period 33 demand rose to 65 units, more than double the late-summer average of ~27.5 units/period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the autumn season (October), and demand is showing signs of an seasonal uplift compared to the late-summer floor. Period 33 peaked at 65 units, while Period 34 saw 34 units (restricted by stockout). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are waiting for 144 units in transit (ordered P31-P34). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the transition into October, I am setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the recent autumn activity (P33-P34), averaging ~50 units per period. This results in a mu_hat of 250 (5 periods * 50 units/period). Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility seen during seasonal transitions (approx 15 units s.d. per period). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the 4-period lead time and the 1-period review cycle, while the 144 units in pipeline will be subtracted to determine the final order.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand uplift confirmed: Average demand for late-September (P33-P34) rose to ~50 units/period compared to the late-summer floor of ~27.5.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) with 214 units in transit. Demand is showing a sustained autumn uplift, averaging ~42.3 units over the last 3 periods (P33-P35), significantly higher than the late-summer floor of ~27.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the Period 31 order arriving in Period 35. With 0 on-hand and high unmet demand in P31-P35, we need to maintain a base stock that covers the next 5 periods (L+1). A recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 captures the current autumn demand regime while ignoring the previous summer lows. sigma_hat with N=3 reflects the current volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed (P33-P35): demand has increased to an average of ~42 units/period, up from the late-summer floor of ~27.5.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in the mid-autumn season for this women's blouse. History shows a spring peak (P2 demand: 392) followed by a summer floor (P24 demand: 15). Recently, demand has shown an autumn uplift, averaging ~42 units over P33-P35, though P36 dipped to 24. We currently have 15 units on-hand and 190 units in-transit (ordered P33-P36). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high pipeline relative to current demand (~4 periods of coverage at 42 units/period), the goal is to maintain a stable base stock without over-ordering before any potential late-autumn/winter shifts. I am setting L to default (4), and using a recent 4-period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat (P33-P36) to capture the autumn regime shift (avg ~40.25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (2019-10-28), typically a period of transition toward late-autumn/pre-holiday demand in retail. Recent history shows a significant demand increase in Period 37 (82 units), which is approximately double the average of the preceding four periods (P33-P36 avg: 40.25). This volatility suggests a second autumn uplift or pre-winter seasonal shift. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P31, P32, and P33). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 158 units (orders from P34, P35, P36). The pipeline covers approx. 2-3 periods of current high demand, and with a total lead time of 4, we must adjust the forecast to reflect the recent spike. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (covering P33-P37) to capture the higher late-autumn trend (Avg: 48.6 units/period) while maintaining the 4-period lead time parameter.

Carry-over insight: Second autumn demand uplift detected starting Period 37: demand rose to 82 units, significantly higher than the P33-P36 average of ~40 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November (Period 39), and we are seeing a significant demand surge. Period 38 demand reached 165 units, more than double the previous week (82 units) and far exceeding the autumn average (~42-50). This suggests a late-autumn/pre-holiday peak for this blouse. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 175 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P35, P36, and P38). Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we must forecast demand for the next 5 periods (Review + Lead Time). I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the sharp upward trend (Avg(P36-P38) = (24+82+165)/3 = 90.3 units/period). Setting mu_hat to 451.5 (5 * 90.3) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this new momentum. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (3) to account for the high volatility observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand surge confirmed: Period 38 demand (165) indicates a sharp upward regime shift compared to the P33-P37 average (~49).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a late-autumn demand surge for this women's cotton blouse. Demand in the last two periods (P38: 165, P39: 112) is significantly higher than the previous autumn average (~40-50). With the date being Nov 11, we are approaching the holiday season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday), which typically drives another peak for apparel. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 307 units in-transit (15 from P36, 85 from P38, 207 from P39). Note that the P36 order (15 units) is now overdue (ordered P36, now P40, lead time 4 means it should have arrived in P40 resolving phase). To account for the holiday surge and protect against stockouts during this high-demand window, I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods of the surge (N=2) to capture the trend, while using a slightly wider sigma_hat (N=5) to account for the volatility seen during transitions. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Late autumn/Holiday surge confirmed starting Period 38: demand increased to an average of 138.5 units (P38-P39) compared to the early autumn average of ~49 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a late autumn/holiday demand surge (mid-November), with demand jumping from an early autumn average of ~49 units to an average of 134.7 units over the last three periods (P38-P40). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 525 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals from orders placed in P37 (0), P38 (85), P39 (207), and P40 (233). The current pipeline is significant but necessary to cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon during this peak (approx 135 * 5 = 675 units needed). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the current high-demand regime, and keep L at the stable 4 periods. The OR engine will use these parameters to determine the required top-up to bridge the gap between in-transit stock and the projected holiday demand.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime peak confirmed (P38-P40): Average demand increased to 134.7 units/period from the early autumn floor of ~49 (+175%).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), facing a confirmed holiday demand surge. Average demand from P38-P41 (the current high-demand regime) is 129.75 units/period. The SKU is currently stocked out (0 on-hand), with 115 units of demand lost in Period 41. However, we have a significant pipeline 'In-transit' of 674 units. This pipeline comprises orders from P37 (0), P38 (85), P39 (207), P40 (233), and P41 (149). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The order from P38 (85 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 42 resolution, so we will have inventory to sell in P42 (though we can't observe it yet). Using N=4 for mu_hat correctly captures the high holiday run-rate of ~130 units. sigma_hat is set to default (entire history) to provide a wider safety buffer during this volatile peak. The OR backend will see the current 674 units in transit and likely cap or reduce the order to prevent late-season overstocking, which is appropriate as we approach the end of the year.

Demand in Period 42 spiked to 295 units, significantly higher than the previous holiday average of ~134 units, indicating the onset of deep holiday shopping (Cyber Week/December). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant demand expected during the lead-time window, the goal is to maintain a high service level while managing the 589 units already in-transit (ordered P39-P41: 207+233+149). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the accelerating holiday demand (P38-P42 avg = 162.8), which results in a mu_hat of ~814 units for a 5-period window (L+1). For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the high holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak acceleration: Period 42 demand reached 295 (+118% vs. prior holiday average), confirming the start of the primary December shopping surge.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday shopping season (Period 44, Dec 9). Demand in Period 42 spiked significantly to 295, followed by a lower realization of 60 in Period 43. However, given the product description (Everyday Collection Blouse) and the calendar date, high volatility and significant demand are expected to continue through mid-to-late December. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 147, and in-transit is 607. Total pipeline (754) must cover the remaining 4 periods of the game (total 47 periods). The average demand of the holiday regime (P38-P43) is approximately 146 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this holiday average while allowing for the December volatility. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the high variance observed (30 to 295 range).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: P42 demand reached 295 followed by P43 demand of 60, resulting in a holiday regime average (P38-P43) of ~146 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has shown significant holiday volatility: P42 peaked at 295, followed by lower demands of 60 (P43) and 73 (P44). The holiday regime (P38-P44) average is approximately 135 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 307 units, with 374 units in transit (expected arrivals in P45, P46, and P47). The game ends at Period 47, meaning orders placed today (P45) with a 4-period lead time will not arrive before the game concludes. Therefore, the primary objective is to manage existing inventory and pipeline to satisfy the remaining 3 periods of demand (P45, P46, P47) without over-ordering. I will set mu_hat based on the recent holiday average (N=7, P38-P44) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current seasonal levels, though actual ordering will likely be capped or zero due to the lead time constraint relative to the game end.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P38-P44) established with an average of ~135 units/period and high volatility (Std Dev ~78).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-338.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the peak of the Christmas and holiday season. Looking at history, the 'holiday surge' (P38-P45) showed high demand (avg ~123 units) but also extreme volatility (e.g., P42 reaching 295, followed by sharp drops). The most recent three periods (P43-P45) show demand significantly cooling from that late-November peak, averaging only 64 units per period. This suggests the primary purchasing window for Christmas has passed. Current on-hand inventory is 397 units with 225 units in-transit (expected in P47). Given the current demand rate of ~64 units, we have over 9 weeks of cover ( (397+225)/64 \u2248 9.7). Since lead time is 4 periods and the game is nearing its end (or shifting into a post-holiday trough), the priority is avoiding high holding costs. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent cooling trend (last 4 periods, N=4, avg=121.7 which includes the outlier at P42, or N=3, avg=64) to ensure the base stock calculation prevents over-ordering while still maintaining a safety buffer for any minor post-Christmas clearance demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling confirmed: 3-period average (P43-P45) dropped to 64 units/period from the peak holiday average of 146.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The holiday shopping season for this women's cotton blouse has concluded, evidenced by a sharp sales drop from a peak of 295 (P42) to an average of ~61 units over the last four periods (P43-P46). This cooling trend is consistent with a post-Christmas retail lull. On-hand inventory is currently high at 345 units, providing over 5 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock levels and the clearly concluded peak season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the post-holiday floor and prevent further unnecessary ordering through the backend OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling confirmed (P43-P46): Mean demand dropped to 61 units/period from the holiday peak of ~135 (+100% volatility). Current on-hand inventory (345) represents significant surplus for January demand levels.
