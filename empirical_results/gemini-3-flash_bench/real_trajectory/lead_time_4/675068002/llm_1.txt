Based on the historical data (avg ~44 units/week in Jan/early Feb) and the Period 1 flash demand of 158 units (Feb 11), there has been a significant demand surge, likely caused by the transition to Spring fashion or a Valentine's Day retail period. Current On-hand is 0. An order of 225 was placed in Period 1 with a promised lead time of 4. According to the timeline, this order should arrive in Period 5. Based on the Period 1 demand (158) and the historical average, I expect demand to remain elevated compared to January, though 158 might be a peak. I will forecast a demand of approximately 100 per period to be safe. My target inventory pipeline must cover (Lead Time 4 + Current Period 1) = 5 periods of demand. Total needed for next 5 periods (P2-P6) is approx 500 units. Current pipeline (In-transit) is 225.

P4 demand slowed to 263, but given the early spring season (mid-March), we should anticipate a mean demand around 300-350 units. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 (225 units) was placed at the start of P1 and is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (P1 + 4 = P5).

Periods 2-3 averaged ~375. Period 4 dropped to 263, and Period 5 dropped further to 192. This suggests a peak followed by a cooling period or high volatility. I will forecast a baseline demand of ~200-250 for the next few periods. c) Lead Time: Period 1's order arrived in Period 5 conclude (arrived during P5, visible at start of P6). This confirms a lead time of 4 periods, matching the promise. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 33. In-transit consists of P2 (275 arriving P6), P3 (500 arriving P7), P4 (850 arriving P8), and P5 (350 arriving P9). Total pipeline (OH + IT) = 33 + 1975 = 2008 units. e) Final Order Logic: We need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods (P6 to P10). At 250/period, target inventory is 1250. Our current pipeline of 2008 already exceeds this target significantly due to high orders placed in P3 and P4 when demand was projected higher.

Current data from P23-P29 shows demand has stabilized at a late-summer low, averaging ~25 units per period (P29 demand was 29). We are now in early September. Historically, lightweight 'airy cotton' blouses may see a secondary minor lift in early Autumn (Back to School/Office), but current inventory of 102 units is more than sufficient. With an average demand of ~25 units, 102 units provides approximately 4 periods of cover, which matches the 4-period lead time. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), maintaining excess inventory is risky. There is no in-transit pipeline.

  "rationale": "We are now at Period 45 with only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Any order placed now would arrive in Period 49, which is after the simulation concludes. Therefore, the decision is based solely on managing the existing 'In-transit' and 'On-hand' inventory to meet the remaining demand while minimizing holding costs. Currently, we have 567 units on-hand and 150 units in-transit (ordered P42, expected to arrive in P46). Historical demand data and recent trends show that after the late November/early December holiday peak (P42: 295 units), demand has sharply declined (P43: 60, P44: 73). Even if demand averaged 100 units for the final three periods, our current on-hand inventory of 567 is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Ordering more units would only incur unnecessary holding costs and provide no benefit to sales or revenue.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The game ends at Period 47. We are currently at the decision phase for Period 46. Based on the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 46) would only arrive in Period 50 (46 + 4), which is past the game's conclusion. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. Looking at the current inventory, we have 508 units on hand and 150 units in transit (ordered in Period 42, expected to arrive during Period 46). Demand has significantly cooled following the late November peak, with recent demand being 60 (P43), 73 (P44), and 59 (P45). Given the current on-hand inventory of 508 units and an expected demand of roughly 60-70 units per period for the remaining two periods (P46 and P47), we are heavily overstocked. Our priority is to avoid additional holding costs while satisfying the remaining demand.",

Furthermore, since the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would not arrive until Period 51, which is beyond the game's horizon. The current on-hand inventory is 606 units, while recent demand (P43-P46) has stabilized at a post-holiday low average of approximately 61 units (60, 73, 59, 52). With 606 units on hand, we have sufficient stock to cover any potential demand in this final period without incurring additional purchasing costs or risking a stockout.
