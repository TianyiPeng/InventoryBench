Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows a stable mean of approximately 39.4 units per week (min 35, max 42) with low variance. We are currently at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The promised lead time is 4 periods. My ordering strategy must cover the lead time (4) plus the current period (1), totaling 5 periods of demand. Using the historical average of ~40 units/week, the pipeline requirement is 200 units (5 periods * 40 units). Since current On-hand and In-transit are both 0, I need to place an order to fill this pipeline. I will order 200 units to establish inventory coverage for the lead time duration while monitoring for potential seasonal shifts as we move towards Spring/Summer, though current data suggests a steady baseline for basics.",

Demand is relatively stable but shows a slight upward trend based on history (samples averaged ~39, while P1 and P2 demand were 32 and 51). Calendar Analysis: Late February/Early March usually marks the transition into spring collections in retail, potentially explaining the demand increase to 51 in P2. Lead Time Assessment: Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from P1 (200 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (P1+4). The order from P2 (50 units) is expected in Period 6. Inventory Status: Currently at 0 on-hand with 250 in-transit. We have missed 83 units of demand (32 in P1, 51 in P2) due to zero starting inventory. Order Logic: I need to cover demand for the lead time (4) plus the current period (1), total 5 periods. Using a conservative forecast of ~50 units/week (based on P2), required pipeline is 250 units. However, since the first arrival isn't until P5, I will face stockouts in P3 and P4 regardless. I already have 250 units in the pipeline which covers the next 5 periods of demand at current rates. Given high holding costs ($1/unit vs $4 profit), I will place a small atmospheric order to account for the increasing trend and ensure a buffer for when the pipeline starts clearing in P5.",

Since the carry-over insight noted a shift to 60+ (Period 3), but Period 5 dropped to 44, I will forecast a middle-ground demand of 55 units/week to account for spring seasonality. c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Period 1 order (200 units) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Orders from Period 2 (50), 3 (50), 4 (70), and 5 (60) are in-transit and expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively. d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: Current on-hand is 156.

Average demand over the last 5 weeks [P9-P13] is (64+66+76+76+39)/5 = 64.2. (c) Lead Time vs. Missing Orders: Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The Period 10 order (150 units) is expected to arrive in Period 14. (d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: Ending on-hand inventory is 535 units. In-transit consists of orders from P10 (150). Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 685. (e) Final Order Logic: At an estimated demand of ~65 units/period, the current inventory of 685 units covers approximately 10.5 periods. Given the lead time is only 4 periods and the holding cost is $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, carrying over 10 periods of stock is excessive and incurs unnecessary holding costs. No new orders are needed until the stock levels normalize.",

However, the most recent demand (91) and the historical trend suggest a continued decline as we move into late August. Currently, on-hand inventory is 905 units, and there are no units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, my current inventory covers over 6.5 weeks of demand at the current average rate (905 / 136 \u2248 6.6), and even more if demand continues to taper seasonally. Ordering more at this stage would likely result in excessive holding costs as the season ends. I will place an order of 0 to allow the existing stock to deplete.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU '717490002' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently entering the December retail period. Historical data and recent trends (P41: 110, P42: 162) show a significant late-Q4 demand spike, likely driven by holiday shopping and promotions, far exceeding the winter baseline of ~40-60 units. As of Period 43, on-hand inventory is 89 units with 0 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, an order placed now will arrive in Period 47. Based on the current trajectory, I expect demand to remain elevated for the holiday peak (approx 120-160 units/week) before tapering off in January. Over the next 5 periods (L+1), total expected demand is approximately 600-700 units (150+150+150+100+50). Subtracting the current 89 units on hand, I need to order approximately 550-600 units to avoid stockouts during the holiday peak and ensure enough inventory for the arrival period.",

Period 44 (2019/12/9) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU '717490002' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently experiencing a holiday demand surge. While the winter baseline is ~40-60 units, late November and early December saw spikes (P41: 110, P42: 162). However, P43 demand dropped back to 42, suggesting a highly volatile holiday regime or a temporary lull before the pre-Christmas peak. We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), with 47 units on-hand and 550 units in-transit (ordered P43, expected P47). Given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P44) will arrive in Period 48, which is after the game ends at Period 47. Therefore, new orders placed now will incur holding costs if they arrive, or they will simply not contribute to satisfying demand within the game's duration. The current pipeline of 550 units arriving in P47 is sufficient to cover the final period's demand, and our existing 47 units must cover the immediate periods. Since we cannot influence inventory availability for P44-P47 with a new order (due to the 4-period lead time), the optimal action is to order 0 to avoid unnecessary holding costs for units that arrive after the game concludes.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday regime volatility: Late-year demand showed significant spikes in late Nov (110, 162) followed by a sharp drop in early Dec (42), indicating high variance during the holiday season.",

Period 45 (2019/12/16) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a Jersey Basic T-shirt (717490002). We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December), facing a 4-period lead time. Historically, demand for this basic staple fluctuated significantly through summer peaks and autumn tapering, arriving at a winter baseline of ~40-60 units. However, a late November/early December holiday surge saw demand spike to 110 and 162 units before settling to 42 and 34 in the most recent two periods. With only 13 units on-hand and 550 units in-transit (ordered in Period 43, expected arrival in Period 47), we face a critical stockout risk for Periods 45 and 46. Because the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) will arrive in Period 49, which is beyond the game end (Period 47). Since the game ends in Period 47 and there is a massive order of 550 units already in-transit that will satisfy all remaining demand once it arrives, and any new order will arrive too late to be sold, the optimal action is to order 0 units to avoid incurring pointless holding costs on inventory that cannot be sold within the game's timeline.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a Jersey Basic T-shirt, which typically experiences low winter demand (baseline ~40-60 units). Recent late November/early December data showed a holiday surge (up to 162 units), but current demand has returned to lower levels (P44: 34, P45: 51). We are currently at Period 46 (Dec 23). Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods. The order placed in Period 43 (550 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 47 (next period). Current on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we will stock out for Period 46 demand. However, the incoming 550 units in Period 47 will create a significant surplus (ending inventory) as we enter January, where demand historically drops to ~30-40 units. With 550 units in-transit arriving next period and 0 on-hand, the total pipeline (550) covers approximately 10-12 weeks of winter-baseline demand.

We are currently at the cusp of the New Year (Period 47, Dec 30). Historical demand from the same period last year (Jan baseline) was approximately 40 units per week. Recent demand in late December (P44-P46) has fluctuated between 34 and 51 units, aligning with this winter baseline. The holiday surge (P41-P42) has concluded. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 550 units in-transit, specifically an order of 550 placed in Period 43. Given a lead time of 4 periods, this 550-unit shipment is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 47. Once it arrives, it will cover over 10 weeks of the expected baseline demand (~50/week). Ordering more now would only increase future holding costs without adding service level benefit.
