Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 660726001, a Women's blouse. Historical demand shows a rising trend from 13 to 27 units over the last three weeks, suggesting a transition from zero demand into a regular sales regime. Given the product type (Blouse), we are entering the Spring season (February), where demand typically stabilizes or increases. I will use the mean of the recent non-zero demand samples (13, 27, 26) which averages 22. This leads to a forecast for the (L+1) period (4+1=5) of 110 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this emerging trend and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen in the start-up phase. Lead time L is set to the promised 4 periods as no history exists to contradict it.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend (0, 0, 13, 27, 26, and most recently 60 in Period 1). The jump to 60 units/period suggests a sharp regime shift, likely due to spring seasonality for short-sleeved blouses. Promised lead time (L) is 4. An order of 48 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit; it is expected to arrive in Period 5 (1 + 4). With on-hand inventory at 0 and current demand at 60, we are facing significant stockouts. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime (avg ~37.6 per period excluding the initial zeros) while the OR backend scales it by (1+L) = 5. L is set to default as we have no evidence yet of lead-time deviation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Straight-cut blouse', which is seasonally relevant for the transition into Spring (late February). Demand has surged significantly from low single digits in January to 60 in P1 and 146 in P2, indicating a clear regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 118 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4. Given the massive jump in demand, using 'default' (all history) would severely underestimate needs. I am switching to 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent high-demand upward trend while acknowledging the early February data point. For L, I will stay with 'default' as we haven't seen any arrivals yet to confirm a lead time change. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last two periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: avg demand jumped from ~16 to 100+ units per week as Spring seasonality begins.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is entering its peak Spring/Summer season. A significant demand shift occurred at Period 1 (late Feb), where weekly demand jumped from a pre-game average of ~13 to an average of 102.6 over the last three periods (60, 146, 102). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 298 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have not reached Period 5 yet, no orders placed during the game (starting P1) have arrived, so we cannot verify the actual lead time; we will stick to the default L=4. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (avg ~103/week). Since the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L)*mean, N=3 will result in (1+4)*102.6 = 513. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the higher volatility (std ~43) of this new regime. This approach ensures the base stock is high enough to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) while we wait for arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Straight-cut blouse' with short sleeves, currently entering the Spring season. Demand has fundamentally shifted from near-zero in Jan/early Feb to a regime averaging ~103 units/period over the last 4 weeks (60, 146, 102, 104). We are currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline (472 units). The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (48 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (this period) because 1 + 4 = 5. We will only see confirmation of this arrival in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Since we have no concluded arrivals yet, we maintain L as 'default'. For mu_hat, we use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new demand regime (~103/week) and project it over (L+1) = 5 periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility seen in the early stage of this regime (std ~35).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is entering its peak Spring/Summer season. Historical demand shifted significantly around Period 1 (mid-February), moving from near zero to an average of ~101 units/week (Periods 1-5 demand: 60, 146, 102, 104, 95). The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. However, we are currently out of stock (ending on-hand in Period 5 was 0) due to high demand and the initial lead time gap. The OR backend needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent demand regime (last 5 periods) where mean demand is 101.4 and standard deviation is ~30.5, I will set mu_hat to 507 (5 * 101.4) and sigma_hat to 68 (sqrt(5) * 30.5) to ensure high service Levels for this high-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. We are managing a women's blouse, which is entering peak spring seasonality. Demand since February 11th (Period 1) has averaged 97.6 units/week, significantly higher than the initial January samples. We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand 0) because demand is consistently outpacing our very low initial stock. For Period 5 and 6, the actual lead time was confirmed at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Currently, 550 units are in-transit (orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6). Period 3's order (180 units) is expected to arrive during this period (Period 7) and will be visible in Period 8's start. I will continue to use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (avg ~105 in last 5 weeks). L will remain at default as the observations match the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (matches promise); demand stabilized at ~100 units/week following the Feb 11th shift.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a women's blouse, which is currently in its peak Spring/Summer demand cycle. Demand has been stable since the mid-February shift (Period 2), with the last five periods (P3-P7) showing demands of 102, 104, 95, 79, and 105. The mean for these 5 periods is 97.0 based on the observed 'demand' field. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P5, P6, and P7 arrivals all showed L=4). Pipeline inventory is healthy at 438 units (Orders from P4=174, P5=161, P6=35, P7=68). With L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 75. While we have missed some sales previously due to stockouts before the pipeline arrived, we now have a steady flow of arrivals matching the demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and variance to capture the post-shift stability while ignoring the low pre-February start.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is entering its peak spring/summer season. Since the demand regime shift on February 11th (Period 1), demand has stabilized at a higher level. The last four periods (P5-P8) show demand of 95, 79, 105, and 114, averaging 98.25 units per week. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (matches promised). Currently, we have 135 units on-hand and 276 units in-transit (orders from P5-P8). The OR backend uses a (L+1) horizon; with L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the recent average of ~100 units/week, mu_hat should be approximately 500. Standard deviation in this regime (N=4) is approximately 15. The OR model will calculate the order based on (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), where pipeline_inventory is on-hand (135) + in-transit (276) = 411. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current stable spring regime while ignoring the initial zero-demand phase from January.

As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the product (women's short-sleeve blouse) is in its peak Spring/Summer season. Demand has been stable since the regime shift on Feb 11th. In the last 9 periods (post-shift), the mean demand is 98.2 units with a standard deviation of 26.1. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (L=4). Inventory status: On-hand is 217 units, and in-transit is 238 units (ordered in P6, P7, P8, P9). Orders are arriving punctually. Under L=4, the base stock targets demand for (L+1)=5 periods. I am using recent_N=9 to capture the current stable seasonal demand pattern while excluding the zero-demand pre-retail period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is currently in its peak Spring/Summer season. Historical demand since the regime shift on Feb 11th has remained stable, averaging approximately 97 units per week (min 79, max 146). Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy: 165 units on-hand and 330 units in-transit. Since demand has been stable for 10 weeks, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture this regime accurately. The OR backend will calculate mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods, which at L=4 is 5 weeks of demand (~485 units). With 495 units currently in the system (on-hand + in-transit), the backend will likely place a small replenishment order or cap the order at the calculated base stock to balance high profit margin ($19.0) against holding costs ($1.0).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is currently in a stable Spring demand regime that began around 2019-02-11. Analysis of the last 11 periods shows a mean demand of approximately 97 units per week (min 60, max 146). The most recent 5 periods (Periods 7-11) show very consistent demand (avg = 96.2). The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods (L=4). With on-hand inventory at 137 and pipeline (in-transit) at 339, we have a total coverage of 476 units. Given a lead time of 4, the OR backend aims to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using N=11 for mu_hat captures the full extent of the Spring regime change, while N=5 for sigma_hat reflects the recent stabilization in volatility. This will ensure the base stock is sufficient to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs, as current stock levels are healthy.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The focus is on Item 660726001, a short-sleeve blouse. Current date is May 6th. Historically, demand shifted in early February from <20 to ~100 units/week. Since then (Period 1 to Period 12), demand has been relatively stable, though the most recent sample (60) suggests a potential cooling or volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand (89) + in-transit (388) = 477. Over the last 10 periods (since the regime shift fully materialized), the mean demand is ~95 units/week. 5 periods * 95 = 475, which roughly matches our current position. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-February regime while allowing for the recent slight decline in demand to be factored into the statistics. The 0.95 service level logic in the OR backend remains appropriate given the high profit/holding cost ratio ($19/$1).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-13. The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is highly seasonal for Spring/Summer. Historically, demand jumped in mid-February to ~100 units/week but has shown a steady decline over the last 4 periods (96, 60, 40). This suggests the peak Spring demand has passed. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 172 units on-hand and 308 in-transit (orders from P10-P13), we are well-covered for the current downward trend. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the recent deceleration in demand (avg ~70), preventing overstocking as we move further into the season. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected starting Period 11 (late April): weekly demand dropped from ~100 to ~40 units, indicating the end of the early Spring peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), we are firmly in a lower demand regime for this SKU (Straight-cut blouse). The Carry-Over Insight from Period 14 correctly identified a deceleration in demand starting around late April. Demand in the last four periods has been 96, 60, 40, and 32, with the average of the last three periods being approximately 44 units/week. This represents a significant drop from the ~100 units/week seen in March/early April. On-hand inventory is currently high (267 units), and there are still 181 units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current demand trajectory, the total coverage (on-hand + in-transit = 448 units) is sufficient for roughly 10 periods of demand at the current rate. Therefore, the goal is to set parameters that prevent excessive replenishment while the system drains the existing surplus. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak deceleration, which will lower the base stock level significantly. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for this short-sleeved blouse has significantly decelerated over the last 5 periods (Periods 11-15: 96, 60, 40, 32, 19), confirming the end of the Spring peak as noted in earlier carry-over insights. The average demand over these last 5 periods is 49.4, but the most recent two periods are much lower (32 and 19). We currently have 325 units on-hand and 104 in-transit (ordered in Periods 12 and 13). Total pipeline inventory is 429 units. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Even at the recent 5-period average (5 * 49.4 = 247) or the lower terminal demand rates, we are currently overstocked. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this downward trend while maintaining a buffer, though the backend's capped policy will likely result in zero orders due to high inventory levels relative to the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline: Weekly demand dropped from ~100 to an average of ~25 units over the last three weeks (Period 13-15), significantly lower than the April peak.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '660726001' (short-sleeved blouse) has entered a post-peak period as we move into June. Demand has significantly decelerated from the mid-year high of ~100 units/week to an average of 18 units/week over the last two periods (P15-P16). Specifically, demand from P13 to P16 was 40, 32, 19, and 18. Current on-hand inventory is 368 units, which is extremely high (covering roughly 20 weeks of demand at the current rate). With an additional 43 units in-transit (ordered P13, expected to arrive in P17), the total pipeline will be 411. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost relative to the now-lower demand, the OR backend should be encouraged to stop ordering. I will use a recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as there is no evidence of delay.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which saw a significant demand peak during the Spring season (mid-February to late April) averaging ~100 units/week. Since Period 13 (early May), demand has entered a sustained decline as the initial Spring surge concluded, dropping to an average of ~25 units/week over the last five weeks, and most recently hitting a low of 15-19 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 396 units, with no units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock levels and the 'Bonus(1)' constraint (high service level), the OR backend will naturally stop ordering (due to the cap and base stock calculation) if mu_hat is adjusted to reflect the current low-demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the demand shift from May onwards (Periods 13-17), which averages approximately 25 units/week. This will prevent further overstocking while holding enough inventory to satisfy the current slow-moving pace.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 13 (May): Weekly demand dropped from ~100 to ~25 units (75% reduction), consistent with the post-Spring peak for this category.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (Period 19). The SKU is a women's blouse (short sleeves), which saw peak demand in February-April (~100 units/week) and has now significantly decelerated since May (Period 13). The last 3 weeks show demand of 18, 15, and 11, confirming the post-spring regime shift noted in Carry-over insights. Total inventory visibility: On-hand is 385 units with 0 in-transit. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods. My objective is to prevent excessive holding costs given the current massive oversupply relative to the low demand regime of ~15 units/week. With on-hand inventory (385) significantly exceeding the expected demand of (L+1)*mu (~5*15 = 75), the OR engine should place zero orders. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the low-demand May/June period) to accurately reflect the current lower demand level while maintaining the default lead time.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which had a significant performance peak in Spring (Feb-Apr, ~100 units/week) but has since entered a low-demand regime starting in May (Period 13). Over the last 7 periods (P13-P19), demand has averaged 23 units/week (40, 32, 19, 18, 15, 11, 26). The current on-hand inventory is 359 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand until Period 25. At an average of 23 units/week, 359 units covers approximately 15 weeks of demand, which far exceeds the current requirement. No further orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 7-period regime to reflect this low-demand state and avoid triggering the OR engine's replenishment logic despite high service level targets (Profit $19/Holding $1). The lead time L is maintained at the default 4.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are observing a significant demand spike for this womens blouse (V-neck, short sleeves). Demand jumped from a steady baseline of ~20 units to 156 units in Period 20. Given the date, this coincides with peak summer retail activity. My previous strategy focused on inventory depletion (placing 0 orders since Period 14) due to the post-Spring decline, but the current on-hand inventory (203) is now nearly exhausted by this single high-demand event. To prevent stockouts during the summer peak, I must pivot the forecast upward. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value based on the latest demand (156) across the lead-time window (L=4 + 1 = 5 periods), assuming this peak might persist for a few weeks. sigma_hat is set to recent volatility. I will keep L at 'calculate' as historical lead times have consistently been 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand spike detected Period 20 (2019-06-24): Weekly demand surged from ~20 to 156 units, likely reflecting peak summer seasonality for short-sleeved blouses.

We are currently in a high-demand Summer period for this 'short cap sleeve' blouse. Demand spiked to 156 (Period 20) and 238 (Period 21), exhausting all on-hand inventory. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The goal is to set parameters that cover the next (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the sharp surge, using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat captured the 156-238 range (average 197), which translates to a mu_hat of ~985 for the 5-period window. For sigma_hat, using recent_N (N=2) will reflect the high recent volatility. L is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods remains accurate according to history.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Demand surged from double digits to an average of 197 units over the last 2 weeks (Period 20-21). Stockouts occurring due to rapid transition.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is currently in its peak summer season (July). Over the last three periods (P20-P22), demand has surged to 156, 238, and 129 units, respectively, averaging 174 units/week. This represents a significant shift from the previous low-demand regime (~20 units). The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 546 units in-transit (ordered in P21 and P22), but these won't arrive until P25 and P26 given the confirmed 4-period lead time. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (95%). To capture this summer peak and prevent further stockouts once arrivals begin, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this new high-demand regime. This will signal the OR backend to maintain a significantly higher base stock. Lead time remains 'default' as it consistently matches the 4-period promise.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand Summer period for this 'short cap sleeve blouse'. Demand surged dramatically in Period 20 (156 units) and Period 21 (238 units), though it moderated slightly in the last two periods (129, 111). We are currently experiencing stockouts (On-hand: 0) while waiting for the large orders placed in Periods 21, 22, and 23 to arrive. The pipeline inventory (814 units) is substantial. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, the order from Period 21 (253 units) is expected to arrive in Period 25. For Period 24, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 'Summer Peak' regime (Periods 20-23), where average demand is approximately 158.5 units/week. Since the OR backend uses mu_hat = (1+L) * mean_demand, and we want to cover the 5-week risk window (L+1), I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current high-demand state and ensure the backend targets a high base stock to satisfy remaining summer demand once arrivals catch up.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime demand average confirmed at ~158 units/week (Periods 20-23) following June 24th surge.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-07-29. We are in the middle of a high-demand summer peak for this short-sleeved blouse SKU (660726001). Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) has been 156, 238, 129, 111, and 198, averaging ~166 units/week. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand=0) because orders from the start of this peak (placed in P21) are only scheduled to arrive in P25 (this period). In-transit inventory as per 'Current Status' is 999 units, which includes orders from P21 (253), P22 (293), P23 (268), and P24 (185). Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on history. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the summer peak average (approx 166 * (1+4) = 830) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the high volatility seen during this regime. L will remain at 'default' (4) as no lead-time drift or lost shipments are detected.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand average revised to ~166 units/week based on Periods 20-24 data (+5% from previous estimate).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (short-sleeved blouse) is currently in a high-demand Summer peak. Since the regime shift on June 24th (Period 20), demand has averaged approximately 158 units per week (Samples: 156, 238, 129, 111, 198, 118). While demand is volatile, the 'Summer peak' remains the dominant environment. We just received the order from Period 21 (253 units), ending a long stockout period, and have a significant pipeline (770 units) arriving over the next 4 periods. The goal is to maintain high service levels (q = 0.95) to capture remaining summer sales while being wary of the eventual late-summer drop-off. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the mean demand since the Summer surge, and default lead time settings as the 4-period lead time remains consistent.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (short-sleeved blouse) has been in a sustained summer high-demand regime since late June (Period 20). Over the last 7 periods (P20-P26), demand has averaged 155.4 units per week, significantly higher than previous periods. Recent deliveries from Period 21 and 22 orders have arrived with a lead time of 4 periods, confirming local lead time stability. We are currently well-stocked (On-hand: 290, In-transit: 549) due to large orders placed during the stockout phase in early July. However, August demand remains robust (last two periods: 118, 138). To maintain service levels while preventing overstocking as the season eventually turns, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods of data (N=7) to capture the current summer demand average (~155 units/week) without being skewed by the spring or transition periods. Lead time (L) is set to 4 based on recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Summer high-demand regime confirmed (P20-P26): Average demand is ~155 units/week since 2019-06-24 surge.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are in the mid-to-late Summer demand regime for the 'Straight-cut blouse'. Historically, demand surged in late June (P20) and has averaged ~155 units/week since then. However, the last few periods show a slight deceleration: P24 (198), P25 (118), P26 (138), P27 (99), suggesting the peak may be passing as we approach late August. Demand over the last 8 periods (the Summer regime) averages 161 units, but the last 3 periods average 118 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to capture the recent deceleration to avoid excess holding costs as the season winds down, while still maintaining enough stock to cover the L+1 window. I will use recent_N with N=8 for demand to capture the full Summer regime but keep a close eye on the downward trend. For sigma, I'll use recent_N with N=8 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed in August: average demand for the last 3 periods (P25-P27) has dropped to ~118 units from the early Summer average of ~155+ units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historical demand shows a Summer peak from late June through July (P20-P24 avg: ~166 units), but demand has decelerated in August (P25-P28 avg: ~112.75 units). Specifically, demand for the last four periods has been 118, 138, 99, 96, indicating a downward trend as we move towards late Summer. As the product is a short-sleeved blouse, this decline is seasonally expected. Current on-hand inventory (548) and in-transit (273) total 821 units, which is quite high relative to the current demand trend. To prevent overstocking and rising holding costs at the end of the season, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current decelerated mean of ~113 units per week. This results in a mu_hat of approx 565 units across the (L+1) horizon. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~166 units (June/July) to ~113 units in August (Periods 25-28), a ~32% decrease.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 30 (Sept 2nd). Historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern: a Spring peak (Feb-Apr), followed by a massive Summer surge (late June to late July), and now a late-Summer deceleration. Demand in August (Periods 25-29) has averaged approximately 106.8 units (118, 138, 99, 96, 83), showing a steady decline from the ~166 units seen during July. As we enter September, demand for a 'short cap sleeve' blouse is expected to drop further as Fall approaches. On-hand inventory is currently high at 489 units, with 249 units in-transit (orders from P26, P27, P28). Total pipeline inventory is 738 units. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining market, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent downward trend (August data). This will lower the base stock level and stop new orders until inventory aligns with the lower seasonal demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: End of Summer peak confirmed: August demand (P25-P29) averaged 107 units, showing a 35%+ decrease from July's ~166 average. Expected further decline in September due to product seasonality (short cap sleeves).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (2019-09-09), we are entering the post-summer season for this short-sleeved blouse. Demand has steadily decelerated from July's peak of ~166 units to an August average of ~107 units, and the most recent two periods (P29, P30) have seen demand drop to 83 and 80 units respectively. This downward trend is expected to continue as autumn approaches for a short-sleeved item. Our current inventory position is very high: 481 units on-hand plus 177 units in-transit (ordered P27, P28). This total of 658 units far exceeds the likely demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), which I estimate to be around 300-400 units given the deceleration. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent excessive holding costs during this terminal phase of the summer cycle, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recent average of ~80 units/week (80 * 5 = 400), which should signal the OR backend to stop ordering and allow existing stock to bleed down. sigma_hat is set based on the last 5 periods to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand deceleration confirmed: P29-P30 demand (avg 81.5) is ~24% lower than August average (107), continuing the post-summer decline for short-sleeved items.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (short-sleeved blouse) is in a clear seasonal decline as we enter mid-September. Demand has decelerated from a July peak of ~166 units to an August average of ~107 units, and most recently a September average (P29-P31) of 87.3 units. Given the short cap sleeves and V-neck description, demand is expected to continue falling as autumn progresses. Current on-hand inventory is 492 units, which is extremely high (covering over 5 weeks of current demand). Total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 559 units. With an estimated (1+L) demand of approximately 425 units (based on recent 3-period average of 85 * 5), the system is already overstocked. I will set mu_hat using the recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the most current decelerated demand level. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock based on the current downward trend, which will likely result in zero new orders to avoid further increasing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: September demand deceleration confirmed: Periods 29-31 average demand is 87.3 units, down ~18% from August average (107) and ~47% from July peak (~166).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Historical data for this short-sleeved blouse shows a consistent demand decline following the summer peak (July ~166, August ~107, September-to-date ~79). Period 32 demand was 59 units, confirming that demand is tapering off as autumn approaches. We have 500 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods (validated by recent arrivals in P29-P32), the current inventory covers over 6-8 weeks of current demand levels. To avoid mounting holding costs (H=$1/unit) on a seasonal item entering its off-peak phase, I am keeping L at the promised 4 periods and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P29-P32) to capture the current downward trend. The backend capped policy will likely result in an order of 0, which is optimal given the high ending inventory and declining seasonality.

Carry-over insight: September demand deceleration confirmed: Periods 29-32 average demand is 80.25 units, continuing the decline from the August average (107) and July peak (~166).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. We are in a confirmed demand deceleration phase for this short-sleeved blouse as the season transitions from Summer to Fall. The 'Carry-over Insights' and recent history show demand has dropped significantly from the July peak (~166 units/week) to an average of approximately 86 units/week over the last 5 periods (P29-P33). Specifically, demand in P32 was 59 and P33 was 107. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (393 units), which covers approximately 4.5 weeks of current demand. There are 0 units in-transit. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the declining seasonal demand, the OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will likely result in a zero or near-zero order, which is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs on a seasonal item ending its peak. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (approx. 86 units/week average).

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn demand regime: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is ~86 units/week, confirming a sustained decline from August levels (~107) and July peaks (~166).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7th, 2019. This SKU is a 'short cap sleeve blouse', which is highly seasonal. Demand has entered a steep decline phase as Autumn progresses. After a period of relative stability in early September (~80-90 units), demand plummeted to 22 units in Period 34. This matches the behavior seen in May (Period 13+), where demand for this short-sleeved item dropped to nearly zero during the off-season. Looking at the last 5 periods (P30-P34: 80, 99, 59, 107, 22), the average is 73.4. However, the most recent observation (22) suggests the end-of-season drop-off is now fully active. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this downward trend for mu_hat, while recognizing that on-hand inventory (371) is already very high relative to this declining demand (representing ~5-10 weeks of stock). No new orders are likely necessary from the OR backend, but the parameters should reflect the lower demand regime to prevent further overstocking as the season ends. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season collapse confirmed: Period 34 demand (22 units) represents a ~75% drop from the September average (~80), signaling the final transition to Autumn/Winter off-season for short-sleeved items.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (short-sleeved blouse) has entered its end-of-season off-peak period. Demand has crashed from summer highs (~160) and early autumn levels (~80) to a current low-regime average of ~24.5 units over the last two periods (P34-P35: 22 and 27 units). With 344 units on-hand and an additional 122 units in-transit (total pipeline = 466), we currently hold roughly 19 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. Given the holding cost of $1.0/unit and the likelihood of further demand decline as winter approaches, the primary goal is to drain existing inventory and avoid any new orders. I am setting L to the promised 4 periods, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the recent collapsed demand regime (N=3) to ensure the base stock calculation remains significantly below current total inventory, effectively halting procurement.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand collapse confirmed for October: Demand dropped ~70% from September levels (avg ~80) to a new low-regime average of 24.5 units (P34-P35).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is entering its off-season in the Northern Hemisphere autumn. Demand has collapsed from a September average of ~80 units to an October average of 23 units (P34: 22, P35: 27, P36: 20). On-hand inventory is currently 324 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the remainder of the season (approx. 14 weeks of supply at current rates). There is no need for further orders. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this low-demand regime (avg ~23), which will result in a base stock lower than my current on-hand + in-transit (446 total), effectively halting new orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (short-sleeved blouse) has entered its late Autumn/Winter off-season. Current date is October 28th. Following the end-of-season demand collapse noted in P35, demand has stabilized at a low regime. The average demand for the last four periods (P34-P37) is approximately 24.5 units per week (22, 27, 20, 29). On-hand inventory is currently 295 units, which is significantly high\u2014covering over 12 weeks of current demand. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 122 units (ordered in P34 and P35), which will further increase the surplus. To minimize holding costs during this off-season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods of data (N=4) to accurately reflect the low demand regime. No new orders are expected to be generated given the current inventory position and low baseline demand.

Carry-over insight: Off-season demand floor confirmed for late October: Average weekly demand has stabilized at ~24.5 units (Periods 34-37), representing the baseline for the Autumn/Winter period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the deep off-season for a short-sleeved blouse. As identified in the Carry-over Insights (Period 38), demand has stabilized at an average of 24.5 units per week (Autumn/Winter floor). On-hand inventory is currently 371 units, which covers approximately 15 weeks of off-season demand. In-transit inventory is 18 units (from Period 35), expected in Period 39/40. With approximately 9 periods remaining in the simulation, the current on-hand stock is more than sufficient to fulfill all remaining demand. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period) which would significantly erode profit. I am setting L to default (4), mu_hat to a recent_N (N=5) to reflect the stabilized low demand regime of ~24.5/week, and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the low volatility of this floor. Because on-hand inventory (371) is far higher than the calculated base-stock (approx. (1+4)*25 = 125 units), the OR backend will correctly stop ordering.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is currently in its off-season (Autumn/Winter). Demand has stabilized at a low baseline; over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 22.7 units per week (22, 27, 20, 29, 28, 10). On-hand inventory is currently 379 units with zero in-transit, providing enough stock for over 16 weeks at the current consumption rate. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high excess inventory (on-hand 379 vs. expected demand of approx 115 units over the L+1 lead window), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 'off-season' regime to prevent any further ordering and minimize holding costs while maintaining a safe service level for the low-demand period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is deep into the Autumn/Winter off-season for a short-sleeved blouse. Demand has continued to decline from the late October average of ~24.5 units per week, with the last two periods (P39-P40) showing demand of 10 and 8 units respectively. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 371 units, while weekly demand is now in the single digits or low teens. With a lead time of 4 periods (making the look-ahead window 5 periods), the total expected demand for the remainder of the season is far below the current stock level. Therefore, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window of 4 (covering the recent drop to single-digit demand) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation reflects the most current, lowest demand regime, preventing any unnecessary orders.

Carry-over insight: Deep off-season demand floor: Demand dropped further in November to <10 units/week (P39-P40), significantly lower than the October baseline of ~24 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is highly seasonal. We are currently in late November (Period 42), which is the deep off-season. Demand has plummeted from summer peaks (~166) and October baselines (~25) to a current floor of <10 units per week (average of 9.0 over P39-P41). Inventory levels are extremely high (362 units on-hand) compared to this demand, sufficient to cover more than 40 weeks of current sales. No further orders are needed as we approach the end of the game (Period 47). I will set the demand parameters to reflect this current low-demand regime using the most recent 3 periods to prevent any further ordering by the OR backend.

On-hand inventory is currently 329 units with zero in-transit, which effectively covers over 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory levels and the proximity to the end of the game (Period 47), no new orders are necessary. I will set the OR parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (using recent_N=4) to ensure the base stock calculation remains below current on-hand levels, thus preventing unnecessary ordering while minimizing holding costs.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th (Period 44). We are in the deep off-season for a short-sleeved blouse. Recent demand (P39-P43) has averaged 13.8 units/week, with a minor outlier in P42 (33 units). Inventory is currently very high (320 units on-hand), which is sufficient to cover more than 20 weeks of demand at the current average rate. Given that there are only 4 periods remaining in the game (P44-P47), no further orders are necessary. The primary objective now is to minimize holding costs while satisfying the minimal remaining demand. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 periods and use the 'recent_N' method (N=6) to capture the current low-demand regime (approx. 16.3 units/week) for the demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Deep off-season demand confirmed for December: Average weekly demand is ~14 units (P39-P43), with on-hand inventory levels extremely high (320 units) relative to remaining game duration (4 periods).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47, with only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47). The product is a short-sleeved blouse, currently in its deep off-season (December). Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 14 units per week over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). Current on-hand inventory is 307 units, which is more than 20 times the expected demand for the remainder of the game. Our primary objective is to avoid incurring further holding costs, as our current stock is far higher than any possible remaining demand. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would not arrive before the game ends (P45 + 4 = P49). Therefore, we will continue to set parameters that result in zero new orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to reflect the current deep off-season average and 'default' for lead time and sigma.

Daily Profit: $2185.00, Daily Holding Cost: $192.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1993.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 46 of 47. The current on-hand inventory is 192 units. Looking at the demand for Period 45 (115 units), there was a significant one-week spike, likely due to a final pre-Christmas clearance or holiday rush. However, the product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is deep in the off-season. Even if the demand for the final two periods (46 and 47) remains at this higher level (e.g., ~115 units), the existing on-hand inventory of 192 is sufficient to cover it. Furthermore, the promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (Period 46) would not arrive until Period 50, which is beyond the game's end (Period 47). Therefore, we must not place any more orders. I will set the parameters to ensure the OR backend generates a zero order by using 'recent_N' with a small N for mu_hat based on the late-year averages, while relying on the inventory cap logic and the fact that on-hand (192) will exceed any reasonable base stock for a 4-period lead time in this season.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Observed a significant late-December demand spike (115 units in P45), likely holiday-related, but on-hand inventory (192) remains sufficient for the final 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1228.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 is the final decision period for this simulation. The current state shows 121 units on hand and 93 units in transit. Demand in the most recent periods has shown a late-December spike (115 units in P45, 71 units in P46), likely due to holiday sales or end-of-year clearing, despite the product being a short-sleeved blouse. Since any order placed now (Period 47) with a lead time of 4 periods would not arrive until Period 51 (well beyond the simulation end), and existing on-hand inventory (121) plus the incoming shipment (93) is more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand, the priority is to minimize ending inventory to avoid holding costs. I will set the base stock parameters to zero to ensure no further orders are triggered by the OR backend.
