Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'HM+ Cora tee'. Historical demand data (5 samples: 43, 55, 46, 53, 59) shows a mean of 51.2 and a standard deviation of 6.22 over the last 5 weeks. There is a slight upward trend, possibly related to approaching spring/warmer weather in February. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no shipments in transit and 0 on-hand inventory, we need to establish a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1), totaling (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. Using all 5 available historical samples (recent_N with N=5) provides the most stable initial forecast for this new item. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to achieve a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 to $1.0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The product is a 'Gently flared top in soft viscose jersey', which is a fashion staple (H&M+ Cora tee). Historical data from Jan-Feb (P-3 to P1) shows demand ranging from 43 to 66 units, with a mean of 53.6. In Period 1, we experienced a stockout because on-hand inventory was 0; we ordered 63 units, but with a promised lead time of 4, they won't arrive until Period 5. Therefore, we remain at 0 on-hand inventory this period. Demand is relatively stable with a slight upward trend (66 in P1 vs. 59 in P0). Since we have only 6 data points (5 historical + P1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full recent context and setting L to 'default' (4). mu_hat will be estimated based on the full sample mean (approx 53.7) across (1+L) periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a clothing item (H&M+ Cora tee). Looking at the demand history, there is a clear upward trend: 43 -> 55 -> 46 -> 53 -> 59 (pre-game samples) followed by 66 (P1) and 88 (P2). The jump to 88 in Period 2 suggests a seasonal shift as we approach spring. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 131 units in transit (63 ordered in P1, 68 in P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5. Since we have zero stock and demand is rising significantly, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand spike (59, 66, 88). This will increase the base stock level to better meet the growing demand once shipments start arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 2019: mean increased from ~50 to 88 (+76% spike in P2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is an H&M+ jersey top. Historical data show a mean demand of 51.2 for Jan-Feb, but recent demand (Periods 1-3) has jumped to an average of 74.7 (66, 88, 70), indicating a shift likely due to spring seasonality for this garment type. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have lost sales in all periods because orders (L=4) have not started arriving yet. The first order from Period 1 is expected to arrive in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (Decision Period 6). In-transit inventory (227 units) encompasses orders from P1 (63), P2 (68), and P3 (96). According to the OR logic, our parameters must cover (L+1) periods of demand. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the recent demand spike (~75 per period). With L=4, mu_hat should target (1+4)*75 = 375. Since the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L)*mean_of_N, setting N=3 for the recently higher demand regime is appropriate. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility in this higher demand state.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is an H&M+ Cora tee, which has seen a demand shift since February. Historical demand (Jan) was ~51, but recent demand (Feb-Mar) has averaged 75.25. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect the first arrival during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, which will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 321 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4). Given the profit of $19 vs. holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (~95%). I will use recent_N=4 to capture the increased demand regime (Mean=75.25, Std=9.4) for the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters to ensure the OR backend maintains sufficient base stock to cover demand until arrivals normalize.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime shift: Feb-Mar demand average confirmed at 75.25 (vs Jan average of 50.6).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/18. The product is a 'Gently flared top', aligning with spring seasonality. Demand analysis: Jan avg was 50.6; Feb-Mar avg (Periods 1-5) is 73.0 (66, 88, 70, 77, 64). We are in a higher sustained demand regime compared to the pre-history. Inventory status: We have 0 on-hand inventory because the P1 arrival of 63 units was immediately consumed by P5 demand (64). Lead time: Period 5 conclude confirms the P1 order arrived with exactly the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the lead time is stable at 4, L is set to default. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (the duration of the current regime) to capture the higher mean (~73) versus the pre-history (~51). This will ensure the base stock covers (4+1)=5 periods of demand at the current rate. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as exactly 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product (H&M+ jersey tee) is entering spring, which typically sees steady demand for light apparel. Historical data from early February onwards (Period 2-6) shows a stable demand regime with mean demand of 74.8 units (88, 70, 77, 64, 75). Actual lead time is confirmed to be exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5 and Period 2 order in Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to 100% stockouts caused by the initial lead-time gap, but arrivals are now consistent with the 4-period offset. Pipeline inventory is 333 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6), which correctly matches the expected demand for the next 4 periods. Since the demand regime has been stable for 5 periods, I will set N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using L=default maintains the promised 4-period lead time, which matches observed reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Feb-Mar average demand is 74.8 units (N=5, P2-P6) with consistent behavior leading into Spring.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (H&M+ Cora tee) is entering the spring season. Historical demand since February has been significantly higher than the initial January samples, stabilizing at an average of approximately 76.2 units over the last 5 periods (P3-P7: 70, 77, 64, 75, 93). The lead time is confirmed to be exactly 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving in P5, P6, and P7 respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (3 units), but the pipeline is well-stocked with 311 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). To maintain service levels given the 4-period lead time, the OR parameters must reflect the current higher demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand while setting L to default (4) as the observed lead time matches the promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and stable: Feb-Mar mean demand is 76.2 units based on last 5 periods (P3-P7), up from initial ~50 units in January.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a lightweight viscose tee, which is seasonally relevant for the spring/summer transition. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than January, with a mean of 77.4 units over the last 5 periods (P4-P8). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8 arrivals all confirm L=4). On-hand inventory is low (15), and the pipeline (311 units) includes orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8. To maintain the necessary service level for this high-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding), I will continue to use the recent demand regime (last 5 periods) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default to the promised lead time of 4.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a 'Gently flared top', which is a spring/summer fashion item. Historical demand from February to March averaged ~75 units, but Period 9 (April 8) showed a drop to 56 units. This could be a temporary fluctuation or a shift as we move deeper into spring. On-hand inventory is 50, and 316 units are in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR engine will target a high service level. To avoid over-ordering during a potential demand dip while maintaining coverage for the 4-period lead time, I will use recent trends. I'll use N=5 for demand to balance the higher February/March levels with the recent lower observation, helping the model smooth out the volatility while acknowledging the seasonal relevance of the product.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering Period 11 (2019/4/22). Reviewing the demand history, there is a clear downward shift in demand over the last three periods (P8: 82, P9: 56, P10: 37). The average demand of the last 3 periods is 58.3, significantly lower than the Feb-Mar average of ~76. This coincides with the product being a 'Gently flared top' (Spring/Summer apparel), where demand may be stabilizing or tapering after an initial seasonal peak. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 65 and 322 units in-transit (covering orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10), we are well-stocked. To prevent over-ordering during this apparent downturn, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent demand regime (avg 58.3) while maintaining the lead time at 4. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base_stock approximately covering 5 periods (L+1) of this lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 9 (April): mean decreased from ~76 to 58.3 (-23%) over the last 3 periods (P8-P10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (April 29, 2019), we reflect on a highly volatile Period 11 demand of 108 units, which contradicts the 'downward trend' noted in the previous carry-over insight. After four weeks of demand ranging from 37-82 (averaging ~58), this sudden spike back above 100 likely relates to the transition into May/Spring fashion for this viscose jersey tee. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P7 order arrived in P11). Given the current on-hand inventory of 31 and a massive pipeline of 248 units (arriving over the next 4 periods), we must be cautious about over-ordering. However, the mu_hat needs to reflect the recent high demand. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the volatility of April (56, 37, 108, and the implicit demand of P11). This averages to ~67.25 per period. The sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to account for this increased variance (std dev ~31).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in Period 11: Volatility increased significantly with a spike to 108 units, reversing the previous April downward trend evidence.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand has shown high volatility recently: after a dip in mid-April (P9: 56, P10: 37), demand surged in P11 (108) and P12 (100). The current date is May, and the product is a 'Gently flared top', which is seasonally relevant for late Spring/early Summer, explaining the increased demand. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 75.25, while the average over the last 2 periods is 104. Given the volatility and seasonal upward pressure, I will use a recent_N approach to capture this higher mean. I'll set N=4 for mu_hat (averaging ~75) to stay responsive to the recovery without overreacting solely to the triple-digit peaks, though the OR engine will multiply this by (1+L). The lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5-P12). Inventory is currently low (on-hand 25), but there is significant pipeline inventory (276 units) covering the pr\xf3ximos 4 arrivals. Following the high volatility in P11 and P12, I will use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to ensure the safety stock accounts for this renewed variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 11: Shift from downward April trend to high volatility/recovery (mean 104 units over P11-P12 vs 46.5 in P9-P10). May seasonality for jersey tops confirmed.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'HM+ Cora tee' (Jersey Fancy) is currently mid-May (2019/5/13). Historically, we've observed a significant demand shift starting in Period 11 (late April) with demand moving from a trough (~46 units) to a high-demand regime (mean of 99.7 units over P11-P13). This aligns with seasonal demand for lightweight jersey tops as temperatures rise. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on 'Period 13 conclude'. With an on-hand inventory of 30 and pipeline inventory of 312 units (P10: 58, P11: 0, P12: 122, P13: 132), we must ensure parameters reflect the high-regime mean to prevent stockouts during this peak seasonal period. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (P11-P13) to capture this May demand level (~100 units/period) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the associated high volatility.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime for Jersey tops confirmed: average demand is 99.7 units over the last 3 periods (P11-P13), significantly higher than April averages.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product (HM+ Cora tee) is in a high-demand regime for the spring/summer season (Jersey Fancy category). Over the last four periods (P11-P14), demand has been 108, 100, 91, and 121, averaging 105 units per period. This confirms the seasonal spike identified in the Carry-over Insights (approx. 100 units/period). Inventory is currently at 0 on-hand following a stockout in Period 14 where demand (121) exceeded starting on-hand (88), though 368 units are in-transit. Lead time is stable at exactly 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the recent N=4 high-demand regime (May peak) to ensure the OR backend generates sufficient orders to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) and recover from the current stockout. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on the last 4 periods to capture the recent volatility (range 91-121).

Carry-over insight: May demand regime for Jersey tops is sustained: average demand is 105.0 units over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), with a recent stockout in P14 indicating high demand pressure.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. This SKU (Jersey Fancy top) is experiencing high May seasonality demand, with an average demand of 105.0 units over the last 4 periods (P11-P14) and a further increase to 126 in P15. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and suffered stockouts in P14 and P15. An order placed in Period 11 (which had ordered=0) meant no arrival occurred in P15 Arrival Resolution. However, we have 494 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect the order from P12 (122 units) to arrive in P16, P13 (132 units) in P17, P14 (114 units) in P18, and P15 (126 units) in P19. To ensure the OR engine maintains a high service level for this current high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P11-P15) to capture the May spike (mean approx 109 units), and setting L to calculate to stay responsive to the consistent 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: May demand peak for Jersey tops confirmed: average demand is 109.2 units over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), significantly higher than the April average (~58).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 17 (June 3rd). The product 'H&M+ Cora tee' (Jersey Fancy) is in a high-demand seasonal phase (May-June seasonality). Historical data shows a clear shift starting Period 11 (late April/early May), with demand averaging 109.2 over the last 5 periods (P11-P15). Period 16 also showed high demand (140), leading to another stockout. There is a missed/delayed shipment from Period 11 (ordered 0 units, but potentially an issue with the pipeline flow in that window) and the Period 15 arrival (ordered Period 11, but ordered quantity was 0). However, the Period 12 order (122 units) arrived on time in Period 16. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 478 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high demand and recent stockouts, I will use a 6-period window (N=6, covering P11-P16) to capture the current summer demand regime (mean ~114 units). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 ensures the OR engine prioritizes the current high-demand peak over the lower April data.

Carry-over insight: June demand regime for Jersey tops sustained: average demand is 114.3 units over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), characterized by high peak demand (140 in P16) and frequent stockouts.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'HM+ Cora tee' (Jersey Fancy) is in its peak summer season (June). Demand remains elevated and volatile, with an average of 114.3 units over the last 7 periods (P11-P17) and frequent stockouts. The Period 17 demand (113) aligns with this sustained peak. Arrival history confirms a reliable lead time (L) of 4 periods. While P15 showed 0 arrivals (Period 11 was a '0' order period), the pipeline is now full with 491 units in-transit. To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs. $1 holding cost ratio, I will base the demand forecast on the recent 7-period 'Summer Peak' regime (P11-P17). This captures the current elevated mean (~114) and the significant variance observed during these peak months.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'HM+ Cora tee' (Jersey top) is in a high-demand Summer season (June). Period 18 demand (118) continues the trend of strong demand observed since mid-May (averaging ~121 over the last 5 periods: P14-P18). Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), the average demand is 123.6, with a peak of 140. Although the April downward trend was reversed by a significant spike in May, the current regime has stabilized at this higher level. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this current high-demand 'Summer peak' regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival messages (P14 order arrived in P18). Shipments appear healthy; P15 was likely a zero-unit order (P11 observation shows ordered=0), so there are no missing shipments to account for. The OR parameters will set the base stock to cover (1+L) = 5 periods of this high demand while accounting for the recent volatility (\u03c3) to minimize stockouts during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime for Jersey tops is confirmed and stable: average demand is 123.6 units over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), maintaining the high levels seen throughout late May and mid-June.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 (late June). The 'HM+ Cora tee' is experiencing peak summer demand. Evidence: Demand in Period 19 spiked to 173 units, the highest recorded, resulting in another stockout. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 134 units, showing a clear upward trend from the previous May/June 'Summer regime' average of ~123. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and high demand pressure, we need to set parameters that capture this momentum. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring the OR engine orders enough to cover the (L+1) window (approx 5 * 134 = 670 total units) against the current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand peak observed: Period 19 demand reached 173 units; average demand for the last 5 periods (P15-P19) increased to 134 units, up from the ~123 average noted in P19.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. The product is a jersey tee, which is in peak summer seasonality. Demand analysis: Period 19 saw a significant spike to 173 units, while Period 20 dropped to 78 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 124.4 units. Although P20 demand was lower, the overall summer regime remains strong and volatile. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this high-demand summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P16 order arrived in P20). The on-hand inventory is 28, and the pipeline is healthy with 582 units in transit (orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20). Setting parameters based on the last 5 periods ensures the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to cover (L+1) periods of high summer demand while accounting for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime for Jersey tops remains high but volatile: average demand is 124.4 units over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), with a significant peak of 173 (P19) and a dip to 78 (P20).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, mid-summer. The product is a flared jersey top, which aligns with high summer seasonal demand. Reviewing recent demand (P17-P21: 113, 118, 173, 78, 79), there's a noticeable cooling from the peak seen in P19 (173), though late July often maintains significant sales before the late-summer drop. The average of the last 5 periods is 112.2 units. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (P17 order arrived in P21). Given the stock level (94 on-hand) and a large pipeline (579 units), the priority is managing the high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 40) during this transition phase in July. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current 112-unit average, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in the last 5 weeks (ranging from 78 to 173).

Carry-over insight: July demand transition: Mean demand slowed to ~112 units (P17-P21) from the late-June peak of 173, but volatility remains high (Std \u2248 40).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in mid-July (Period 23). The product is a jersey top, which saw peak demand in late June (P19 reached 173 units). Demand has cooled significantly over the last three weekly periods: P20 (78), P21 (79), and P22 (52). The average demand over the last 3 periods is 69.7 units, a sharp drop compared to the midsummer peak average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy (164 units), and a large pipeline of 488 units exists (from orders in P19-P22). Given the clear downward trend in demand as we move past the mid-summer peak, using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) for mu_hat is appropriate to avoid over-ordering based on trailing high-demand data. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the volatility of this transition. Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' because the system consistently reports 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: July demand transition confirmed: Mean demand dropped to ~70 units over last 3 periods (P20-P22), down from the late-June peak of 173 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1055.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the HM+ Cora tee is entering a late July/August phase, where demand has significantly declined from the June peak. The mean demand over the last 4 periods (P20-P23) is approximately 69.25 units, down from the mid-summer average of ~134 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 237 units, which is sufficient to cover nearly 3.5 periods of demand at the current rate. Additionally, there are 347 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 20-22), meaning the pipeline is very full. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand stock and substantial in-transit volume, the focus is now on preventing excessive holding costs as the summer season winds down. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the current lower demand regime, and sigma_hat using the same window to capture the recent volatility as demand settles.

Carry-over insight: July demand decline confirmed: Mean demand dropped to ~69 units over last 4 periods (P20-P23), down from the late-June peak of 173 units, signaling the end of the peak summer season.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '294008002' (H&M+ Cora tee) has transitioned from its peak summer demand (June average ~124 units) into a significantly lower July regime. The last five periods (P20-P24) show demand of 78, 79, 52, 68, and 39 units respectively, averaging approximately 63 units per period. The current 'on-hand' inventory of 372 plus the 'in-transit' inventory of 173 units (total 545 units) is extremely high relative to this new demand level. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 captures the July slowdown (average ~63 * (1+4) = 315), and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 reflects the recent volatility. This setup will signal to the OR backend that no new orders are needed (since 545 > 315) and will focus on liquidating current stock to minimize future holding costs.

Carry-over insight: July demand decline confirmed: Mean demand dropped to ~63 units over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), down from June peaks, signaling a post-summer seasonal transition.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 294008002 (Jersey tee) has entered a clear post-summer decline. Demand has consistently dropped from June peaks (>130 avg) to a much lower level in July (avg ~62 units over last 5 periods P21-P25). We currently have an extremely high inventory position (440 units on-hand) due to large orders placed during the June peak (P20-P21) arriving just as demand collapsed. At an average demand of ~60, the current on-hand stock covers over 7 weeks of demand, well beyond the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). Consequently, the system should not place new orders. I will set the demand parameters using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime (approx. 63 units/period) and use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the 4-period lead time remains consistent. High holding costs will be incurred, but no further capital should be committed to inventory for this item until the on-hand stock is significantly depleted.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for Jersey tops is established: mean demand has decreased to ~63 units (P21-P25), a 50% drop from the June peak. Significant overstock currently exists.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 294008002 (Jersey Fancy top) has entered a post-summer demand decline. In Period 26, demand was 44 units, and the average demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) is approximately 59 units, confirming a significant drop from the June peak (~124 units). Currently, the system has 427 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, and the current mean demand is around 59 units, the required base stock to cover (L+1) or 5 periods of demand is approximately 295 units (excluding a safety buffer). The current on-hand inventory of 427 units is more than sufficient to cover demand for at least 7 periods. To avoid high holding costs and further overstocking, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 6-period average to reflect the lower demand regime. This will result in a zero order from the OR backend because on-hand exceeds the calculated base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for Jersey tops is confirmed: average demand decreased to ~59 units over the last 6 periods (P21-P26), down from the summer peak of ~124 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The 'H&M+ Cora tee' (Jersey Fancy) is transitioning out of its peak summer season (May-June), where demand reached as high as 173 units. Since Period 20, demand has dropped significantly, averaging 58.6 units over the last 7 periods (P21-P27). On-hand inventory is currently very high at 362 units, while there are 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are well-covered for the current demand regime. The goal is to let the on-hand inventory bleed down to avoid excessive holding costs. I will maintain mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (the post-peak regime) and sigma_hat likewise to reflect the reduced demand levels and lower but still present volatility. L remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019/08/26). Based on historical demand data and the product description (HM+ Cora tee, a short-sleeve jersey top), we have exited the peak summer season (June/July) and entered a stabilized post-summer regime. The demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) has averaged approximately 57.2 units (39, 74, 44, 65, 64), which is consistent with the 'post-summer' carry-over insight of ~59-63 units. On-hand inventory is very high at 298 units, significantly exceeding the current demand levels for the (L+1) horizon. With a lead time confirmed at 4 periods, a base stock targeting a mean of ~58 units/period would require approximately 290 units (5 * 58). Since on-hand is already 298 and there is no in-transit inventory, no additional orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the stabilized late-summer demand and use default for L and sigma_hat to maintain standard buffer calculations, allowing the high on-hand to satisfy requirements.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Post-summer demand regime stabilized around 57 units (average of P24-P28), confirming the transition from the June peak of ~124 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. The product is a jersey top, which saw a significant demand peak in June (reaching 173 units) and has since transitioned into a post-summer stable regime. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P24-P29) shows demand ranging between 39 and 74 units, with a mean of 55.0 units. Previous insights suggested stabilization around 57 units; the most recent data (P29 demand: 44) supports a continued lower-demand regime as we enter September. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory status: On-hand is 254 units, and an order of 105 units from Period 29 is in-transit. Given that mean demand is ~55 units and the lead time is 4 (meaning a 5-period risk horizon), the total system inventory of 359 units (254 + 105) significantly exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (5 * 55 = 275). While the OR backend will likely order 0 due to this surplus, I will set parameters to reflect the current stable post-summer regime to ensure the base stock calculation is accurate should inventory drop further.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for Jersey tops is stable: mean demand is 55.0 units over the last 6 periods (P24-P29), confirming a transition away from summer peaks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for the Jersey top, which has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the June peak. Analysis of the last 7 periods (P24-P30) shows demand values of 39, 74, 44, 65, 64, 44, and 25, yielding an average of approximately 50.7 units per period. The most recent demand (P30) was particularly low at 25 units. There is currently a significant overstock with 229 units on-hand and 105 units in-transit (due for arrival around P33). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods. Given the high inventory levels (covering over 6 periods of demand) and the stable/low demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture this post-summer cooling while maintaining a buffer for late-season volatility. L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time history.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for Jersey tops is confirmed stable through late August/early September: mean demand is ~51 units over the last 7 periods (P24-P30), down from early summer peaks of ~124.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. This Jersey top is in a stable post-summer demand regime. Over the last 8 periods (P24-P31), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 49.9 units per period (39, 74, 44, 65, 64, 44, 25, 41), significantly lower than the June peak of ~124 units. Total inventory (on-hand 188 + in-transit 105) is 293 units. With an expected demand of ~50 units per period and a (L+1)=5 period coverage window, the required base stock is approximately 250 units. Since current pipeline inventory (293) already exceeds this coverage requirement, no new units are expected to be ordered by the backend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple previous arrivals. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this stabilized downward trend and prevent further overstocking while holding costs are being incurred on the current 188 units.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for Jersey tops is confirmed stable through mid-September: mean demand is ~50 units (measured over P24-P31), reflecting the end of the summer peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is a Jersey fancy top, which has transitioned from a high summer peak (June/July) into a stable post-summer demand regime. Over the last 9 periods (P24-P32), demand has averaged 50.5 units with moderate volatility (Std \u2248 15). The most recent demand (P32) was 60 units. We currently have a significant overstock situation with 128 units on-hand and 120 units in-transit (ordered in P29 and P32), totaling 248 units of pipeline inventory. Given the current average demand of ~50.5, our current inventory covers nearly 5 periods of demand. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To prevent further inventory buildup while maintaining service levels for the stabilized fall demand, I will use a 9-period lookback (N=9, covering the stable period since late July) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach acknowledges the lower demand levels while accounting for recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for Jersey tops is confirmed stable through late September: mean demand is 50.5 units over the last 9 periods (P24-P32), with a standard deviation of approximately 15 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 294008002 (Jersey top) has transitioned into a stable post-summer demand regime. Current observations from Period 24 through Period 33 show a mean demand of approximately 52.1 units with significantly lower volatility compared to the summer peak. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and consistent, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 29 order in Period 33. On-hand inventory is currently high (167 units) following the recent arrival of 105 units. With 79 units already in-transit (from orders in P32 and P33), the total pipeline inventory is 246 units. Given the stable demand of ~52 units per period, this inventory covers nearly 5 periods of demand (L+1), which is aligned with the required coverage. I will continue using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect this stabilized post-summer regime while discarding the volatile June/July data.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for Jersey tops is confirmed stable through late September: mean demand is 52.1 units over the last 10 periods (P24-P33), with standard deviation stabilizing significantly below summer levels.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The product is a jersey top, which completed its summer peak (June/July) and has stabilized into a post-summer demand regime. For the last 11 periods (P24-P34), demand has averaged 47.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. The most recent demand (P34) was quite low (16 units), but given the stable history since August, I will maintain the N=10 window for mu_hat to capture the current regime without overreacting to a single low point. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods. With 151 units on-hand and 152 in-transit (P32 order of 15, P33 order of 64, P34 order of 73), the inventory position is strong relative to the current demand level. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a safety stock that balances the high-profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (August-October) confirmed stable: mean demand is 47.3 units over the last 11 periods (P24-P34), significantly lower than the summer peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. The 'Cora tee' is a jersey top, which experienced high demand during the summer (June/July peaks up to 173 units) but has since stabilized into a post-summer regime. For the last 12 periods (P24-P35), the average demand has been approximately 44.9 units. The most recent three periods (P33-P35) show a further softening (66, 16, 18), likely reflecting autumn seasonality or a cooling of interest in short-sleeve jersey tops. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 133 and in-transit at 169 (total pipeline 302), and a target weekly demand around 45-50 units, the system currently holds enough stock for approximately 6 weeks, which is sufficient given the (L+1)=5 period lead time protection. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the stabilized post-summer demand mean and volatility, while allowing the OR backend to maintain the service level for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (August-October) remains stable with a slight downward trend into mid-October: mean demand over P24-P35 is 44.9 units, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~124 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is October 21, 2019. The product (HM+ Cora tee) is in a post-summer demand regime which has been stable since approximately Period 24 (late July). Demand has shown a consistent downward trend as we move further into autumn, with the most recent observations (P34-P36) being 16, 18, and 13 units respectively. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is 30.6 units, but the last 3 periods specifically average only 15.6. Given the seasonal nature of a 'soft viscose jersey short sleeve top', demand is expected to remain low or continue to taper off during late October. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P32 order arriving in P36. Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 135, In-transit: 163), totaling 298 units, which covers nearly 10 periods of the current mean demand. To prevent further overstock and minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) to capture the tapering effect.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline is accelerating into late October: mean demand dropped to 15.6 units over the last 3 periods (P34-P36) from the previous ~50 unit average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the HM+ Cora tee is in a significant seasonal decline as we move into late October. Period 37 demand was only 10 units, and the average over the last 4 periods (P34-P37) is approximately 14.25 units, compared to the stable post-summer average of 50. Currently, we have 189 units on hand and 99 in transit (ordered in P34-P36). With a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we need to cover demand for (4+1)=5 periods. Even at 20 units per period (generous given recent data), we only need ~100 units total. Our 'inventory position' (189 + 99 = 288) far exceeds any realistic demand forecast for the remainder of the season. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the significantly lower demand regime and ensure no additional orders are placed, minimizing further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand decline confirmed in late October: average demand dropped to 14.3 units (P34-P37) from the previous ~50 unit regime, suggesting end-of-season clearance behavior.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '294008002' (Jersey top) has entered a late-season decline as of early November. Demand has plummeted from a ~50 unit regime to an average of 12.0 units over the last 5 periods (P34-P38). Current on-hand inventory (253 units) is extr\xeamement high, potentially covering over 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. Pipelines are mostly clear with only 26 units in-transit (orders from P35 and P36). Given the proximity to the project end (Period 47) and the confirmed downward trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new low-demand regime (using recent_N=5) to prevent any further ordering. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent concludes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting P34: Average demand has dropped to 12.0 units (P34-P38) from the previous ~50 unit regime, signaling end-of-season for this Jersey top.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the HM+ Cora tee has entered a clear late-season decline as of early November. The recent demand regime (P34-P39) shows a mean of approximately 12.8 units per period, a sharp drop from the previous ~50-unit stable period and the summer peak of ~124 units. Specifically, the last four periods (P36-P39) have seen demand between 9 and 13 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 259 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (sufficient for ~20 periods). The game is approaching its end (Period 40 of 47). With lead time confirmed at 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 44, leaving only 3 periods of sales remaining. Given the massive overstock and the terminal stage of the product lifecycle, no further orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime to prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary orders, although the high inventory levels will naturally result in zero orders due to the base-stock logic.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor confirmed: Demand for the Cora tee has stabilized at a low-volume regime of ~12 units/period (P34-P39) as of November, signaling the final phase of the product lifecycle.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (jersey top) has transitioned into a very low-volume end-of-season demand regime as of mid-November. The last seven periods (P34-P40) show demand stabilized at a mean of approximately 12.7 units (16, 18, 13, 10, 9, 11, 12). Current on-hand inventory is 256 units with no units in transit, which is far more than enough to cover the remaining 7 periods of the game (total expected demand ~90 units). Therefore, no new orders should be placed. I am setting L to default (4), mu_hat to its lowest relevant mean using recent_N (N=7 to capture the 'floor' regime), and sigma_hat to reflect the low volatility in this period. The backend OR logic (min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)) will correctly result in zero orders given the massive inventory surplus relative to the new demand levels.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'H&M+ Cora tee' is in its end-of-season phase as of late November (Period 42). Demand has stabilized at a very low 'floor' level, averaging approximately 10.5 units over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), down significantly from the summer peak. The current on-hand inventory is 248 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate and the fact that we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47). This inventory level is sufficient to cover more than 20 periods of current demand. Therefore, no further orders are required. I will maintain lead time at the confirmed 4 periods and align demand parameters to the current low-volume regime using the last 8 periods of data, while ensuring the OR backend sees that we are significantly overstocked.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Cora tee) is in its end-of-season phase, with significantly reduced demand. Since Period 34, demand has stabilized at a low-volume regime, averaging approximately 12 units per period (P34-P42 mean = 12.6). The current on-hand inventory is 232 units, which is far in excess of needs for the remaining 5 periods of the game (P43-P47), even at the highest observed demand levels in this regime. There is NO in-transit inventory. Given the high holding cost relative to the risk of stockout at these demand levels, the inventory strategy is to halt all ordering and deplete existing stock. Parameters are set to reflect this low-volume regime to ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand regime (November-December) confirmed stable: mean demand is 12.6 units over the last 9 periods (P34-P42), with minimal volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Cora tee) is in its end-of-season phase as of December. Demand has remained low and stable since Period 34 (late October), with an average of approximately 12.6 units per period over the last 10 periods (P34-P43). Current on-hand inventory is 215 units, which provides roughly 17 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. Given that we are at Period 44 and the simulation ends at Period 47, we have a significant surplus and no need to place further orders. Existing pipeline inventory is zero, following the conclusion of all previous orders. The goal now is to minimize holding costs by avoiding any additional ordering. I will maintain lead time at the promised 4 periods and set demand parameters to reflect the low-volume end-of-season regime (approx 12.6 per period).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is currently in a stable end-of-season demand regime, with an average demand of approximately 12.3 units over the last 11 periods (P34-P44) and very low volatility. The game is entering its final stages (Period 45 of 47). Given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) would arrive in Period 49, which is beyond the end of the game (Period 47). Currently, there are 205 units on-hand, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining periods' demand (expected total is ~12-15 units per period for the next 2-3 periods). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. My parameters are set to reflect the current low demand regime to ensure the OR backend does not place unnecessary orders while our current inventory is drained.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (H&M+ Cora tee) is in its end-of-season/winter phase as of Dec 23rd. Historical demand since Period 34 (late October) has consistently averaged ~12.6 units per period, with a slight seasonal uptick in Period 45 (26 units). Current on-hand inventory is 179 units, which covers approximately 14 periods of demand at the current end-of-season rate. With only 2 periods remaining in the simulation (total periods 47) and no units in transit, no further orders are required. The OR backend should focus on minimizing holding costs while liquidating existing stock. I will use the recent demand regime (N=11, covering P34-P45) to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is entering the final period of the year (2019/12/30). Historical demand for the last 13 periods (since P34) has stabilized in a low-volume, late-season regime with an average of approximately 13.5 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 162 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining lead time and review periods (L=4), especially since the game ends at Period 47. There are no units in transit. Given the high carry-over inventory and the low, stable demand, no further orders are required. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=13 to capture the stabilized end-of-season demand mean and variance accurately for the OR backend, ensuring it recognizes the low demand level and avoids placing redundant orders.
