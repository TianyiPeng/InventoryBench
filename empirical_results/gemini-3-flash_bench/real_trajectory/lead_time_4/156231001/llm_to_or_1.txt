Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Box 4p Tights', which likely sees stable demand but might experience modest variations around seasonal shifts or fashion cycles. Historically (last 5 weeks), demand averages 183.2 units/week with a standard deviation of 29.5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no lead time history yet, I will use the default lead time (4). For demand, I'll use all 5 available samples to establish the baseline. mu_hat needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. 183.2 * 5 = 916. sigma_hat should be sqrt(5) * 29.5 \u2248 66. Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0), the OR backend will target a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1)). This conservative approach prevents overstocking of low-margin items with high holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 228 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4. On-hand was 0, resulting in 203 lost sales. Demand for the last 6 weeks (including the sample provided and Period 1) was: 186, 151, 151, 198, 215, 203. The mean demand is approximately 184 units/week. Since the current period is February, we are approaching the end of winter/start of spring. Demand for 20 denier tights is relatively stable but may see a slight lift. As promised lead time (L) is 4, I need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using the mean (184) * 5 = 920. My pipeline inventory is currently 228. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent stable demand regime while accounting for the recent variability.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Box 4p Tights', which typically sees stable or slightly increasing demand as spring approaches in late February/early March. Historical demand samples (Jan-early Feb) averaged 183.2 units. However, recent demand in P1 (203) and P2 (313) shows a significant upward shift. The mean of the last 5 samples (P1, P2 and the 3 provided pre-game Feb samples) is approximately 228.4. Current on-hand is 0 with 457 units in transit (ordered P1: 228, P2: 229). With a promised lead time of 4, the P1 order is expected to arrive in P5. Since we have zero inventory and high recent demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the volume increase, and L=default (4). No shipments have concluded yet, so lead time inference is not yet possible.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is 20 denier tights, a basic staple. Historical demand was ~150-200 in Jan, but recent demand (Periods 1-3) has shifted higher to ~203, 313, and 309, averaging 275 over the last 3 weeks. Current on-hand is 0, with 771 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since P1's order was placed at the start of P1, it is scheduled to arrive during P5 (P1+4) and will be visible in the P5 conclude message (read at P6 start). Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals so far is expected. To address the demand shift from the original ~180 to ~275, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volume and volatility. I will use the default promised lead time (4) as there is no evidence yet to suggest a deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 2019: mean weekly demand increased from ~180 to ~275 (+53%).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The SKU is 'Box 4p Tights' (Womens Nightwear/Socks & Tights). Current on-hand inventory is 0, with 1,149 units in-transit. A notable demand regime shift was recorded in Period 4, with average weekly demand increasing from ~180 to ~275 since early February. Specifically, demand in Periods 1-4 was 203, 313, 309, and 235 (average 265). Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have not yet observed any 'conclude' messages showing arrivals (the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 5 and visible at the start of Period 6), we remain in an stockout state. We use recent_N (N=4) for demand and sigma to capture this higher-demand regime accurately. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4 until data suggests otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first successful arrival occurred in Period 5: 228 units (ordered Period 1) arrived, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand context: Historical samples (Jan) averaged ~170. Post-Feb demand (P1-P5) has shifted higher, averaging 246 units. Specifically, since Period 2, weekly demand has been 313, 309, 235, and 170. While Period 5 was lower (170), the overall mean since February remains significantly higher than the January baseline. I will use recent_N=5 (covering Periods 1-5) for mu_hat to capture this elevated regime. Pipeline inventory (1097 units) is currently very high relative to expected demand (approx. 250 * 5 = 1250), so the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering via the base stock policy. sigma_hat is set to default to provide a stable buffer over the full history including recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The carry-over insights correctly identified a demand regime shift in February 2019. Initial demand (pre-Feb) was ~181 (avg of 186, 151, 151, 198, 215). Since Period 1 (Feb 11), weekly demand has been: 203, 313, 309, 235, 170, 237. The average of these 6 observations is ~244.5. However, if we look at the most recent 5 weeks to capture the higher stabilization, it's ~252. Given the product (20 denier tights) and the spring timing, demand is moderately high but stable. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 5 and 6 conclusions). With On-hand = 50 and In-transit = 943 (from orders in P3, P4, P5, P6), we have a substantial pipeline. I will set L to 'default' (4) as the promised lead time aligns with observations. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to cover the entire post-Feb regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect the current volatility (std dev is ~55).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/01. We have confirmed a lead time of 4 periods based on orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arriving exactly 4 periods later in Periods 5, 6, and 7. Demand analysis shows a shift from the initial pre-February average (~180) to a higher regime. Since Period 2 (the start of the new regime), demand has averaged 257.8 units ((313+309+235+170+237+243)/6). In Period 8, we are entering April; for 'Matt tights/socks', demand typically remains steady or slightly declines as spring weather warms, but current historical data doesn't show a downturn yet. I will use recent_N to capture this higher demand regime (N=6, covering Periods 2-7). Setting L to default (4) as it aligns with observed actuals. This will maintain a base stock level that accounts for 5 periods of demand (L+1), helping to build up safety stock against the high variance seen in recent weeks (\u03c3 \u2248 50).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing 'Box 4p Tights'. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5-P8) confirm an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. Since L=4, the base stock must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Looking at demand history, there was a regime shift around Period 2 (late Feb), with recent weekly demand (P5-P8) averaging approximately 250.25 units (170, 237, 243, 351). There is a visible upward trend culminating in a demand of 351 last period, which may be related to seasonal spring demand for 20 denier tights. To capture this recent trend without overreacting to the single highest peak, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to focus on the post-shift performance. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to capture the increased volatility (Std Dev \u2248 74 per week). On-hand is 148, and in-transit is 757 (covering orders from P5, P6, P7, P8), which align with the lead time and expected arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P8 (351 units), suggesting a potential seasonal upturn in April for hosiery.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with orders from periods 1-5 arriving exactly as promised. Demand analysis shows a shift starting around Period 2. Early samples (Jan/P1) averaged ~180, while the last 8 periods (P2-P9) averaged 281.6 units. The most recent demand (P8-P9) shows higher volatility (351 and 286 units), suggesting a potential seasonal impact as noted in Carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 928, which matches orders from P6-P9 (75+230+276+347=928). Given the profit/holding ratio is 1:1, the service level target is 50%, making our base stock equal to the expected demand over (L+1) periods. To adapt to the higher demand regime while smoothing the recent volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the regime since P2) and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the recent increase in variance.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 starts with 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 10, where demand (214) exceeded available stock (113). The product is 'Box 4p Tights', which currently shows a higher demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by multiple consecutive arrivals). Demand in the recent regime (since Period 2) averages approximately 275 units, but there was a significant spike to 351 in Period 8. The most recent demand (Period 10) was 214, but we were stock-limited in sales. Given the seasonal nature of tights in mid-spring and the recent stockout, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (since the regime shift in Period 2) to capture the higher average demand and volatility while maintaining the lead time at 4. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand over the 5-period cycle (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 10 stockout confirmed: Demand (214) exceeded on-hand inventory (113), indicating the need for higher safety stock during the current higher-demand regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019/04/29). The product is 'Box 4p Tights', which typically sees stable but seasonally sensitive demand. Analysis of concluded periods confirms a reliable lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 2, weekly demand has shifted into a higher regime compared to the pre-game history, averaging approximately 254 units per week (Periods 2-11). There was a recent stockout in Period 10 where demand (214) wiped out the 113 on-hand units, despite a 4-period lead time arrival. Current on-hand is low (49), while in-transit inventory is high (1080), covering approximately 4.25 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the consistent lead time performance, I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the modern regime (starting from Period 2) which reflects the higher observed mean of ~254. For sigma_hat, N=10 will encapsulate the increased volatility seen in April (e.g., Period 8 demand of 351).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Historical demand since the regime shift in Period 2 (where average demand increased to ~275) has shown some variance, with a peak in P8 (351) followed by a cooling period in P9-P12 (avg ~222). The product (20 denier tights) is a staple item, but demand might be stabilizing or slightly declining as May begins. On-hand inventory is 116 units, with a large pipeline of 945 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and the moderate demand in the last 4 periods (P9-P12 avg: 222.5), I will use a N=4 window for mu_hat (L+1 = 5 periods) and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand profile while maintaining enough safety stock to avoid a repeat of the P10 stockout. The OR backend will naturally reduce orders due to the high pipeline inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Historically, demand for this SKU (Womens 20 denier tights) saw a regime shift in early February, increasing from approximately 180 to an average of 250+ units per week. Although 2018/2019 spring data showed a brief spike in early April (P8: 351), demand has since stabilized in the 180-210 range over the last three weeks (P11-P13). On-hand inventory is healthy (278) and there is a robust pipeline (650). The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the P13 'conclude' message). To maintain a high service level while avoiding excessive holding costs given the current demand stabilization, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 6-period window to capture the post-spike mean more accurately than the full history, while keeping safety stock robust via sigma_hat calculation over the same period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 15 (May 2019). Analyzing recent performance: After a demand spike in April (Period 8 saw 351 units), demand has stabilized. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 198.8 units, which is a significant drop from the higher-demand regime observed in March/April. Currently, on-hand inventory is healthy at 428 units, and arrivals are consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1). Given the recent stabilization of demand, I am using a recent window of N=5 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents over-ordering based on the high April demand while maintaining enough stock for the current lower-but-steady regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in May: Avg demand P10-P14 is ~199, down from the ~275 average seen in the previous regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), the demand for SKU 156231001 (Box 4p Tights) has stabilized following a volatile period in late April. The demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) has averaged 201.4 units (181, 209, 185, 205, 227), which is significantly lower than the ~275 average seen in the prior regime but slightly higher than the baseline from Period 1. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at 4 periods, with the Period 11 order arriving in Period 15 exactly as promised. My current on-hand inventory is 303, with 464 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15), which provides a healthy pipeline. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%. Since the current demand regime (May) is stable, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this stabilization, and L to calculate to acknowledge the consistent 4-period lead time history.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Box 4p Tights' is entering June (Period 17). Historical analysis shows a demand regime shift occurred around Period 10 (mid-April), moving away from the earlier volatility seen in March/April. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged 194 units per week (min 157, max 227), displaying relative stability compared to the earlier peak of 351. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on consistently observed arrivals (P12 order arrived in P16). Currently, on-hand inventory is 287 units and in-transit is 556 units. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat captures the current lower demand level (avg ~194) while providing sufficient coverage for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect current lowered volatility without being over-penalized by the April outlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed for May/June: Weekly demand avg ~194 units (P11-P16), significantly lower than the P2-P10 avg of ~250 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical data and recent demand trends (P11-P17) show a stabilized demand regime for Matt tights, averaging approximately 180.4 units per week, which is significantly lower than the ~250 units seen during the spring (late Feb to April). The most recent period (P17) showed a sharp drop to 99 units, which may be a seasonal outlier as summer begins, but we should prioritize the recent stable regime (last 7 periods) to avoid overreacting while reflecting the cooling demand. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 240 units on hand and 631 in-transit (total 871), the inventory position is relatively high compared to the current demand (~180/week). Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this lower demand regime effectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: June marks a transition to summer demand lows for tights, with Period 17 demand (99 units) significantly below the May average of ~200.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-247.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a summer demand contraction for tights (Period 19, mid-June). Recent demand samples (P17: 99, P18: 127) confirm a shift away from the May average (~200) to a significantly lower regime as temperatures rise. With on-hand inventory at 374 and 402 units in-transit (total pipeline of 776), we are heavily overstocked for the current demand levels (~113/week). Since holding costs and profit are equal ($1/unit), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the mean. To adjust for this seasonal shift, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' where N=2 to focus exclusively on the June demand collapse. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. These parameters will signal the OR backend to place minimal to zero orders until the excess inventory is cleared, minimizing holding costs during the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (mid-June): Demand has dropped to an average of ~113 units/week (P17-P18), a ~43% reduction from the May average.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a summer demand regime for hosiery (20 denier tights), which typically sees a significant decline in demand during warmer months. The recent data confirms this: demand for the last three periods (P17, P18, P19) has been 99, 127, and 83 units respectively, averaging approximately 103 units per week. This is a substantial drop from the May average of ~200 units and the spring high of ~250 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 301 units on hand and 392 units in transit (expected arrivals from P16-P19 orders), the pipeline inventory is currently 693 units. Given the projected demand of ~103 units per week and a lead time of 4, the required base stock (covering L+1=5 weeks) is approximately 515 units plus a safety buffer. Since our current pipeline (693) already exceeds this requirement, no further orders are likely necessary this period. I will set mu_hat to reflect this new summer average using the last 3 periods (N=3) to quickly recalibrate the OR engine to the current demand level, while keeping L at the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The SKU is '20 denier Matt Tights', which typically experiences low demand during summer months (June-August). Historical data shows a clear downward trend: demand dropped from ~200 units in May to ~100 in early June, and most recently reached 83 units (P19) and 41 units (P20). The average demand over the last four weeks (P17-P20) is approximately 87.5 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (493 units), and there are an additional 159 units in-transit (ordered in P17 and P18), which are expected to arrive in P21 and P22. Given the seasonal low and the current high inventory level, no new orders are necessary to cover the (L+1) period demand horizon. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this summer regime and setting sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the decreased but variable demand at these lower levels.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime deepening in July: Avg demand P17-P20 dropped to ~88 units/week, down from the June average of ~113. Significant inventory surplus currently held.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (20 denier tights) is in a deep summer demand trough, as confirmed by July sales. Period 21 demand was only 53 units, following a trend of 99, 127, 83, 41, and 53 over the last 5 weeks (average ~80 units). On-hand inventory is extremely high (567 units) relative to this demand, sufficient to cover approximately 7 weeks of sales without further orders. Holding costs now significantly outweigh the risk of stockout. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5) to reflect this low-demand regime (approx. 400 total over lead time+review period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. No new orders are expected or needed for several weeks.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for tights reached in July: average demand (P17-P21) is ~80 units/week, a further decline from the June average of ~113 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 20 denier tights, which is highly seasonal with a significant demand drop during the summer months (July). We are currently in the middle of July (Period 23), and demand has reached a trough, averaging approximately 60.6 units over the last 5 periods (P18-P22: 127, 83, 41, 53, 53) and only 49 units over the last 3 periods. Current On-hand inventory is 546 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we are covered for several months at current demand levels (546 / ~60 = 9 weeks). The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which further supports a lean inventory approach during this period. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and variance to reflect the established summer trough while allowing for slight stabilization, and 'calculate' for lead time as the 4-period lead time remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed for July: Average demand P18-P22 is ~61 units/week, a ~46% drop from the June average (~113). Inventory surplus is substantial for current demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 20 denier tights, a seasonal item that sees significant demand drops during summer. We are currently in late July (Period 24), which is the peak of the low-demand summer regime. Historical demand over the last five periods (P19-P23) has been 83, 41, 53, 53, and 30, averaging approximately 52 units per week. This is a dramatic decrease from earlier in the year. The current on-hand inventory is 516 units, which, at the current average demand rate, represents roughly 10 weeks of stock. Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, and there are no units in-transit, we are significantly overstocked. To minimize holding costs while demand remains in this trough, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 samples (capturing the full summer decline) and keeping L at default. The objective is to let on-hand inventory bleed down to a level appropriate for the current demand regime before placing any new orders.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the deepening summer demand trough for 20 denier tights (late July). Over the last 4 periods (P21-P24), demand has been extremely low: 53, 53, 30, and 9 units respectively (averaging ~36 units/week). My on-hand inventory is 507 units with zero in-transit, which at current demand levels covers over 14 weeks of supply. This is a massive surplus, and since holding costs are equal to profit ($1.00), minimizing inventory is the priority. I am setting L to default (4) as lead patterns are stable, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 4-week regime (P21-P24) where demand has plummeted. This will result in a very low base stock, preventing further orders while the current surplus is gradually sold off throughout the remainder of the low-demand summer season.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for tights reached its lowest point in late July (P24 demand: 9 units). Avg demand (P21-P24) is ~36 units/week, a ~40% further drop from the already low early-July average (~61).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 20 denier tights, which is highly seasonal with a significant trough during summer months (June-August). Current date is August 5th (Period 26). Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has been extremely low: 53, 53, 30, 9, 19 (average ~33 units/week). We currently have 488 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given the holding cost of $1.0/unit and the very low current demand regime, the priority is to avoid ordering and reduce the inventory surplus. I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect this summer trough in order to keep the base stock level low, which will result in zero orders until the on-hand inventory is depleted or demand picks up for autumn.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for tights confirmed throughout July and early August: Avg demand P21-P25 is ~33 units/week, a further decline from the June/July average. Extreme inventory surplus exists relative to current demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (20 denier tights) is currently in a deep summer demand trough (July/August), reflected by low demand and high on-hand inventory (404 units). Period 26 saw a slight uptick in demand to 84 units, which may signal the very early stages of a 'back-to-school' or 'autumn transition' increase, but demand remains well below the on-hand stock level. Given the 4-period lead time, any order placed now would arrive in mid-September (Period 31), when demand typically recovers for hosiery. However, with 404 units on hand and recent weekly demand averaging ~28 units over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), we already have sufficient cover for many weeks. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to naturally stop ordering due to the inventory surplus. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Potential early signal of summer trough exit (P26 demand 84 units), but overall demand remains low (P22-P26 avg: ~39 units/week). High inventory surplus (404 units) provides multiple periods of coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-10.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand of 197 in Period 27 confirms that the summer trough for tights (typically late June through early August) has ended. August marks the 'back to school/work' transition for hosiery, where demand historically shifts from single digits/low double digits back toward the ~200 units/week range seen in May. Period 26 demand was 84, and Period 27 was 197, showing a clear upward trajectory. The average of these last two periods is ~140, but given the seasonal context of 20 denier tights in late August, a return to the long-term stable mean of ~185-200 is expected. However, we currently have 207 units on hand and 0 in-transit. With an expected demand of ~150-200, we have just over one week of coverage. Given the 4-period lead time, we must start ordering now to avoid a stockout in mid-September when autumn demand typically peaks. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the sharp upturn (Avg P25-P27: 100 * 5 = 500), but I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat of 925 (185 units * 5 periods) to ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment order immediately, as simple averaging still lags the seasonal shift.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough exit confirmed: Demand increased from 84 (P26) to 197 (P27), signaling the start of the autumn/back-to-school demand regime for tights.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering the autumn/back-to-school demand regime for 'Box 4p Tights'. The summer trough (July avg ~30-50 units) has clearly ended, with the last three periods showing demand of 84, 197, and 149 units (average ~143). Historically, the February-May period averaged around 200-250 units. Transitioning to the autumn regime, I expect demand to stabilize near the higher levels seen earlier in the year. The current on-hand inventory is low (58 units), and while we have 313 units in transit (expected in P32), we need to ensure the base stock is set to meet this new, higher demand level (L+1 = 5 weeks of coverage). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the shift from the trough (average of 84, 197, 149), and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime shift confirmed: Demand increased from summer lows to an average of ~143 units/week (P26-P28) as of late August.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We have exited the summer trough andentered the autumn/back-to-school demand regime. Current demand is considerably higher (avg ~153 units/week over the last 3 weeks, excluding the stockout-capped Period 29) than the July average (~33). Period 29 demand (114) was capped by low on-hand inventory (58), so true demand is likely higher (~140-200 based on P27-28). With 0 on-hand inventory and 550 units in-transit (ordered in P28 and P29), we are waiting for arrivals. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since P28's order won't arrive until P32, we face a stockout in P30 and P31. I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new autumn regime (P26-P29), and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the increased volatility as we transition out of summer.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Demand shifted from ~33 units/week in July to ~150+ units/week in late August. Inventory stockout occurred in Period 29 due to this rapid recovery.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a confirmed autumn demand recovery (Back-to-School/September surge) for tights. Demand has risen significantly from the summer trough (average ~182 units over the last 5 weeks: 84, 197, 149, 114, 243). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in stockouts in Periods 29 and 30. There are 680 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 28, 29, and 30), with the first batch (313 units) expected to arrive in Period 32 (based on the confirmed 4-period lead time). Period 31 demand must be satisfied by whatever arrives this period, but since no order was placed in Period 27, arrival will be 0. To capture the current regime and prevent further stockouts once the pipeline arrives, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the autumn shift (~182 units/week). L remains at the promised 4 periods, which has been consistent in history.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand recovery confirmed: Average demand P26-P30 has increased to ~182 units/week (+450% from summer lows).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 156231001 (tights) has exited the summer trough and entered the Autumn/Back-to-school regime. In Period 31, demand reached 274 units, continuing a strong upward trend from 243 in P30 and 114 in P29. The current average for this new regime (P27-P31) is approximately 195 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a stockout since Period 29. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are in an recovery phase, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current upward trend while maintaining a relatively high sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility seen in the last few periods (84, 197, 149, 114, 243, 274). This should signal the OR backend to place orders that replenish the pipeline effectively as we move toward the peak autumn/winter season for this product category.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: Demand has climbed steadily from a summer low of 9 units (P24) to 274 units (P31), with an average of ~195 units/week over the last 5 periods. Pipeline is recovering but on-hand stockout persists since P29.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn regime for tights (Sept 2019). Period 32 demand was 255 units, and the average of the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is approximately 207 units/week. This confirms a significant recovery from summer lows. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P28 order arrived in P32). On-hand inventory is low (58), but the pipeline is full (664 units), with large orders from P29-P32 expected to arrive sequentially. To maintain service levels during this peak, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean (approx. 207) and volatility, while resetting the lead time parameter L to the proven 4-period duration.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime mean settled near ~205 units/week (P28-P32 avg: 207), returning to early-year demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $295.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand spiked significantly to 496 units, far exceeding the recent autumn average of ~205 units/week. This suggests we've moved from a 'back-to-school' recovery into a higher early-autumn/winter peak for tights (20 denier hosiery). The on-hand inventory was completely depleted (stockout), though 237 units arrived. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp demand increase (496 is more than double the previous 5-period average), I must adjust mu_hat upward to prevent further stockouts. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on an anticipated demand level of ~350 units/week to account for the current momentum, as a simple average (recent_N) would lag significantly. Pipeline inventory is healthy (740 in-transit + 313 ordered this period), but we need to ensure the base stock level targets this higher regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Demand spiked to 496 units, signaling a transition from autumn recovery (~205 avg) to a higher peak season (likely October/winter demand for hosiery).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Box 4p Tights) is entering its peak winter season in October. After the autumn recovery, Period 33 and 34 show a significant structural demand shift. Period 33 demand was 496 and Period 34 was 358. The average over these two peak periods is 427 units. We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) despite recent arrivals, indicating that the OR backend's previous parameters were too conservative for this peak. I am setting L to 'calculate' (stable at 4 periods). I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat, forecasting a weekly demand of 450 units to account for the October/November hosiery peak (450 * (4+1) = 2250). I am using 'explicit' for sigma_hat with a value of 180 (approx sqrt(5) * 80) to account for the high volatility seen in the transition from autumn to winter. This high base stock is necessary to clear the stockout and build safety stock for the high-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak confirmed at Period 34: Oct/Nov demand for tights has shifted to a new regime with an average of ~427 units/week, doubling the autumn average.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand winter peak for tights (October). Recent demand over the last two periods was 358 and 351, which follows a spike of 496 in Period 33. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 346.8 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, despite recent arrivals, because demand is far outstripping the stock arriving from previous lower-forecast orders. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the product category and the time of year, we expect this high demand to persist or potentially increase as colder weather sets in. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the high-demand regime of the last 3 weeks (avg ~401), and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent volatility. This should help the OR engine place larger orders to recover from the current stockout and maintain high service levels during the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak regime continues: Average demand P33-P35 is ~401 units/week, maintaining the significant increase first noted in Period 34.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand winter peak for 20 denier tights (October). Recent demand data (P33-P36) shows a sustained shift with weekly demand averaging ~385 units (496, 358, 351, 337). The previous 'autumn' avg was ~205. This represents a significant regime change. The system is currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) because recent arrivals are fulfilling orders placed during the lower-demand autumn period. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we must ensure the pipeline (sum of orders for P37, P36, P35, P34, P33) covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current in-transit is 1819 units, and arrivals in P37 (ordered P33) and P38 (ordered P34) are expected. To stabilize, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the new peak mean (~385 * 5 = 1925) and use a higher sigma_hat based on recent volatility to prevent further stockouts. Method 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 will pick up this ~385 average effectively.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand confirmed for October/November: Average demand (P33-P36) is ~385 units/week, a ~90% increase over the autumn average of ~205 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for tights is currently in its winter peak (October/November), with significant stockout pressure. The demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) has averaged 397.8 units/week, with the most recent demand hitting 447 units. Despite high in-transit quantities, on-hand inventory has been consistently depleted or minimized since the autumn transition. Promised lead time remains 4 periods. To maintain service levels during this seasonal high, I am setting mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the winter peak regime and sigma_hat similarly to account for the increased volatility seen during this period (e.g., the jump to 496 in P33 and 447 in P37). Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to use the historical consistency of the 4-period arrival window.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand sustains high levels: Average demand (P33-P37) is ~398 units/week, consistent with the shift identified in Period 34/35.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the winter peak season for tights (late October/early November), with demand maintaining a significantly higher level compared to the autumn recovery. The average demand from Period 33 through Period 38 is approximately 383 units per week. While Period 38 saw a slight dip to 309, the preceding weeks (496, 358, 351, 337, 447) confirm a sustained high-demand regime. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory has finally recovered (268 units) following the Period 34 shipment arrival, but consistent stockouts in previous weeks highlight the need to maintain a robust base stock. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6, covering the shift from P33 onwards) to capture the winter peak mean of ~383 units. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=6 to reflect the current high volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a high service level through the peak season while account for the 4-period lead time.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the peak winter season for tights. Demand has stabilized into a high regime following the October surge. Looking at the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand values were [358, 351, 337, 447, 309, 322], yielding an average of approximately 354 units per week. While earlier periods in October showed higher peaks (near 500), the most recent three weeks suggest a slight softening or stabilization around the mid-300s. I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this peak-season volume and volatility while filtering out the initial transition spike from Period 33. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P38 order arrived P34, P39 order arrived P35). On-hand inventory has finally recovered (529 units) and with 1064 units in-transit, the pipeline is healthy to meet the sustained winter demand.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand stabilized in November: average demand (P34-P39) is ~354 units/week, down slightly from the initial October surge but remains high for the season.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the 'Winter Peak' demand regime for tights. Analysis of the last 7 periods (P34-P40) shows demand has averaged approximately 343 units per week (ranging from 271 to 447). While the initial October surge (P33-P34) was higher, the regime has since stabilized around this mid-300s level. On-hand inventory is healthy at 604 units following the arrival of the P36 order (346 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the average of the last 7 periods to capture this stabilized winter demand level, while maintaining standard volatility estimates. This will help the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the profit margin while avoiding excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the year.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Matt tights' is currently in its winter peak regime (Nov 2019). Over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), the average demand has been approximately 347 units/week. This represents a significant increase from the autumn levels but shows signs of stabilization compared to the initial October spike. On-hand inventory is healthy at 428 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) of 998 units is robust. Since the lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, I am setting L to 'calculate'. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current winter regime (P34-P41) while smoothing out the extreme 496-unit spike from P33. This balances the need for high service levels during peak season against the cost of excessive holding as we move deeper into the quarter.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak regime average demand for P34-P41 is ~347 units/week, showing stability after the initial October surge.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are in the peak winter/pre-holiday season for 'Box 4p Tights'. Recent demand (Period 42) spiked to 461 units, while the average demand over the last 9 periods (P34-P42) is approximately 349 units. This reinforces the high-demand regime established in October. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of the Period 38 order in Period 42. Since we are entering December, demand is expected to remain high due to colder weather and holiday events, but it may begin to taper off towards the late month/January. To capture the recent variability (especially the high P42 demand) without over-reacting to a single spike, I am using recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the initial October surge (496-577 range) with the slightly lower November average (~300-350) and the most recent P42 jump. The OR backend will use these statistics to maintain a sufficient safety stock (z* around 0 for p=h=1, but the base stock calculation targets the 50th percentile, and the cap protects the 95th). Pipeline inventory is healthy (873 in-transit), but the 461 demand in P42 significantly reduced on-hand stock to 341.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Winter peak demand remains volatile but high into December; P42 demand (461) indicates sustained strength in the winter regime (P34-P42 average: ~349 units/week).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019. We are in the final stages of the winter peak for tights (20 denier), which has shown high but volatile demand. Recent weekly demand (P34-P43) has averaged 334 units. However, there is a noticeable softening in the most recent period (P43 demand: 200), which may signal the start of a post-peak decline as we move towards mid-December. The lead time L is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 376, with 1,096 units in-transit (orders from P40-P43). Total pipeline + on-hand is 1,472 units, covering roughly 4.4 periods of recent average demand. Given the potential for demand to taper off after the pre-holiday surge, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the winter regime (average ~340) while acknowledging the high sigma observed in recent weeks (standard deviation around 85 for P34-P43). These parameters aim to maintain a high service level through the end of the year while beginning to guard against overstocking as the peak season concludes.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Winter peak demand showing potential early signs of deceleration in December (P43 demand 200 vs. seasonal avg ~340). Total pipeline remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $181.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019, which is in the middle of the winter peak/holiday season for tights. Recent demand has been volatile, with Period 43 dropping to 200 units and Period 44 rebounding strongly to 367 units. The average demand for the 'winter peak' regime (since Period 34) is approximately 343 units per week. While there was a slight concern about deceleration in P43, the strong P44 demand confirms the winter regime is still active. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent receipts from P32 through P44. With on-hand inventory at 186 and a large in-transit pipeline of 1092, the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand at the current average. Given the high profitability and holding cost being equal ($1/$1), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting the OR engine will target the median. I will set mu_hat based on the last 11 periods (P34-P44) to capture the current winter regime mean (~343 * 5 = 1715).

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand average (P34-P44) confirmed at ~343 units/week; lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), we are in the middle of the 'winter peak' demand regime for tights. Recent demand samples (P42: 461, P43: 200, P44: 367, P45: 468) show high volatility but a strong sustained average around 343 units/week. Historical evidence suggests that demand for this SKU typically drops significantly after late December/early January as the winter peak subsides. While current demand is high, we must start preparing for the post-holiday dip to avoid excessive holding costs in January. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods. With 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in P45 and an in-transit pipeline of 1288 units, replenishment is needed but must be calibrated. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the winter regime (P34-P45) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which provides a mean of ~343 and captures the high volatility seen in the peak season. Since L=4, mu_hat will be based on (1+4)=5 periods of demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, which is the immediate post-Christmas and pre-New-Year period. Historical context shows we are in the peak winter regime for 20-denier tights, with demand consistently high. Recent demand (P45: 468, P46: 450) confirms this sustained peak. Since Period 34, the average demand has been ~350 units/week, but the last two periods show a significant step up toward 450+ units. I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering the winter regime from P34 onwards) to capture the base level, but the OR engine's service level logic (q ~ 0.5 given profit=1, holding=1) will naturally target the median. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 1491 units in transit, but demand is exceeding supply due to the recent spikes (P45-46).

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand reached its highest sustained level in December (P45-46 avg: 459 units/week), significantly above the Oct/Nov regime average of ~350 units.
