  "rationale": "This is Period 1. The product is a women's strap top (Everyday Basic), which generally has steady demand but can see increases as spring/summer approaches. Historical demand from January/early February shows a mean of approximately 134 units per week (162, 142, 115, 133, 118). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and there is 0 on-hand/in-transit inventory, I must order enough to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). Using the historical mean of 134, 5 periods of demand equals 670 units. I will order 670 units to establish the pipeline and meet the projected demand for the lead time duration.",

The promised lead time is 4 periods. With an order of 670 units placed in Period 1 (expected to arrive in Period 5), our current in-transit is 670. However, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have already lost 157 units of sales in Period 1 due to stockout. My objective is to cover demand for the lead time plus one period (L+1 = 5 periods). Estimating mean demand at ~140 units, the target pipeline ('on-hand' + 'in-transit') should be approximately 140 * 5 = 700 units. Since current pipeline is 670, I will order 130 additional units to cover the Period 2 demand and adjust the pipeline safety buffer slightly upwards to account for potential spring seasonality increases and to mitigate the impact of the initial stockout.",

Recent periods (P1-P5) show demand of 157, 244, 175, 149, and 138, averaging 172.6. The spike in P2 (Feb 18) might be due to early spring shopping.

At an estimated demand of 170 units/period, the total requirement is 850 units. Since 1106 units are already in the system, we have a surplus relative to the short-term forecast. However, as weather warms, demand for 'Strap tops' typically increases. To maintain a safety buffer and account for potential growth while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit is high relative to $1 profit), I will place a moderate order to keep the pipeline steady as the P3 shipment arrives and begins to deplete.",
