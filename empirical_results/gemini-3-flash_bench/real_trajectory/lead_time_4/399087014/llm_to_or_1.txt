Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is 'S.Skinny L.W Epic' (Ladies Denim Trousers). Current on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Demand history provided includes five samples from Jan 7 to Feb 4: [82, 35, 31, 48, 55]. The mean of these samples is 50.2 units/period, and the standard deviation is approximately 20.3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there are no concluded periods yet, I will use the default promised lead time. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I will calculate the expected demand over the (1+L) period horizon (1+4=5 periods) using the mean of the available historical samples. Calculating (1+4) * 50.2 = 251. For sigma_hat, I will use the standard deviation of all samples adjusted for the horizon: sqrt(5) * 20.3 \u2248 45.4. This will set an initial base stock to address the immediate zero-inventory state.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Ladies Denim Super Skinny Jeans'. Inventory is currently 0 with 84 units in transit (ordered P1, promised lead time 4). Period 1 demand was 61. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are [82, 35, 31, 48, 55], mean = 50.2, std = 19.6. Although P1 demand (61) is higher than the historical mean, it is within one standard deviation. Given we have no stock yet and the promised lead time is 4, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. mu_hat = 5 * 50.2 = 251. No lead-time deviations have been observed yet as the P1 order is not due until P5.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is Ladies Denim (super-skinny jeans). Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) averaged 50.2 units/period. However, actual demand in P1 and P2 was 61 and 130 respectively. The P2 spike (130) aligns with late February/early March seasonal transitions in retail. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory due to the 4-period lead time, with 167 units in transit (84 from P1, 83 from P2). P1's order is expected to arrive in P5 conclusion (visible in P6). To capture the recent demand surge and ensure sufficient base stock for the next 5 periods (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to weight the P1 and P2 demand (avg 95.5) more heavily than the Jan baseline, while keeping sigma_hat default to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge observed starting Period 2 (130 units), significantly higher than Jan average (~50). Monitor if this is a sustained seasonal peak.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand in January was low (~50 units/week), but February showed a significant jump (61, 130, 104), averaging 98.3 units per week. This suggests a seasonal shift for 'Super Skinny Low Waist Epic' jeans as spring approaches. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 319 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4. The order from Period 1 (ordered Feb 11) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4), meaning we will likely face stockouts in Period 4. To recover and maintain a high service level, I am shifting the demand forecast to reflect the recent February regime. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the average demand of ~98.3 units, resulting in a base stock scaled for (1+4)=5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility (std \u2248 35) seen in February compared to January.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in February: Average demand increased from ~50 to ~98 (+96%) compared to January, likely due to spring seasonality for denim.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The SKU is '5-pocket super-skinny jeans', which experiences high demand during the spring transition. Historical demand samples from Jan (~50) and recent game history (Feb-Mar) show a significant surge: Period 1-4 demand values are 61, 130, 104, 86, averaging ~95. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (during this period); we haven't seen an 'arrived' confirmation yet because the 'conclude' message for P5 will only be visible in P6. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 475 units. I will set mu_hat to handle the higher Feb/Mar demand regime (avg ~95) using recent_N=4 to capture this shift accurately. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4 until data suggests otherwise.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is Ladies Denim trousers, which typically sees strong demand in early spring. Historical data and the last 4 weeks of competition history show a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 1 (Feb 11). January samples averaged ~50 units/week, while the last 5 weeks in the simulation have averaged ~93 units/week (61, 130, 104, 86, 85). We have strictly 0 on-hand inventory due to high demand and the 4-period lead time. Our first order (84 units from P1) arrived in P5 and was immediately sold out, confirming a lead time of 4 periods as promised. Pipeline inventory is currently 448 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5), which are expected to arrive in P6, P7, P8, and P9 respectively. Given the consistency of the recent demand (N=5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this higher February/March demand regime. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the ~93 units/week average and the associated volatility to prevent further stockouts as shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Feb-Mar average demand is ~93 units/week, up from ~50 in Jan. Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-25. We have 4 units on-hand and 432 units in-transit. The product is Ladies Denim (super-skinny jeans), which is entering a peak spring season. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Demand has stabilized since February: the average demand over the last 6 periods (P1-P6) is 90.8 units (61, 130, 104, 86, 85, 79), significantly higher than the January average of ~50. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this 'Spring Regime' while ignoring the lower January data. For lead time, I will use the default 'promised' 4 periods as it matches our recent arrival data (P5/P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $624.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), historical data shows a significant demand spike in Period 7 (179 units), likely driven by the start of April and spring fashion seasonality for denim. This is nearly double the February/March average of ~93 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on concluding orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 343 units in transit. To account for this new April surge, I'm increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher volumes of Periods 5-7 (avg ~114) plus a buffer for the upward trend. Sigma_hat is also updated using recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility (179 vs 79). Since lead time is consistent at the promised 4 periods, I will use 'default' for L.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge in Period 7 (179 units), nearly doubling the previous regime average (~93), signaling strong early-April/spring seasonality for ladies' denim.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is Ladies' Denim, which is experiencing a significant spring demand surge. Historical demand samples (pre-Period 1) were low (avg ~50), but demand from Period 5 onwards has risen sharply. Specifically, the last two periods (P7 and P8) saw demands of 179 and 148, respectively, indicating a new regime shift or seasonal peak. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is approximately 122.75. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). On-hand inventory is low (8 units), but pipeline inventory is robust (394 units) following a large order in Period 8. To address the higher demand level and volatility seen recently, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current spring demand regime (avg ~123 pods, significantly higher than the initial ~50-90 pods). Lead time 'L' remains 'default' at its promised 4 periods, which aligns with observed data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated in early April (P7-P8): avg demand increased to ~163 units/week (+75% from Feb-Mar avg of ~93). Confirming spring peak for Ladies' Denim.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), we continue to see strong demand for Ladies' Denim (Super-Skinny washed jeans) as spring peaks. Demand history shows a clear regime change: Jan (~50), Feb-Mar (~93), and April (P7-P9: 179, 148, 88; avg 138). While P9 demand dropped to 88, there were stockouts (only 65 available), suggesting latent demand remains high. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P5 order arrived as expected). Total in-transit is 540 units (P6-P10 orders). To capture the spring peak and account for the high critical ratio (80%), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the high-demand April regime shift (averaging ~125 units/week) and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility in this peak period. L is set to default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high levels for April peak: avg demand ~125 units/week (P6-P9) compared to Feb-Mar avg of ~93.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is 'Ladies Denim', currently in late April. Historically, demand spiked in early April (P7=179, P8=148) and has since decelerated (P9=88, P10=74). The April peak appears to be cooling off as we enter late April/May. However, the stockout in P9 and P10 (sold < demand) suggests that previous orders were insufficient for the mid-regime surge. Current status: On-hand is 0, with 641 in transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P1-P6 arrivals). Since demand is transitioning from a high peak (~125) to a lower level (~80), I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent cooling trend (avg ~98) while staying slightly above the low points to prevent stockouts if demand rebounds. Sigma_hat needs to reflect the high volatility seen during the peak transition, so I will use the last 5 samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak cooling in late April: Average demand decreased from ~163 (P7-P8) to ~81 (P9-P10). Overall April average (P7-P10) is 122 units/week.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we are transitioning from April into May. The demand in Period 11 was 160 units, significantly higher than the previous two periods (~80), suggesting that the 'cooling' noted in the previous carry-over insight was premature or that demand is highly volatile during this Spring peak for Ladies' Denim. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 637 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand in the most recent period (160) and the previous April peak (179 in Period 7), I will use an explicit forecast. I expect demand to remain strong but potentially begin a seasonal decline as we move further from the core Spring peak. I will forecast a mu_hat based on an average of 110 units per week across the L+1 (5) periods. Sigma is set to reflect the high volatility observed in April (ranging from 74 to 179).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in late April (P11 demand: 160), contradicting previous signs of cooling. April average demand settled at approximately 118 units/week.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th. Historically, the product (Ladies Denim) experienced a peak in April (avg ~125), and demand in Period 12 remains high at 128 units. While late April showed volatility (Period 11: 160, Period 12: 128), demand appears to be settling into a high-level regime rather than sharply declining. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (all observed arrivals since Period 5 have a lead time of 4). Our current on-hand inventory is 79, and we have 430 units in transit (arrivals expected from orders in P9, P10, P11). I will set \u03bc\u0302 based on the last 6 periods (P7-P12) to capture the elevated April/early May demand levels (avg ~130). With a promised lead time of 4, the OR engine needs to cover 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the current high-demand environment and the recent volatility observed during the spring peak.

Carry-over insight: May demand transition: Late-April and early-May demand remains high (avg ~130 units/week over P7-P12), maintaining the spring denim peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087014' (Ladies Denim) is in its peak spring season (May 13th). Historically, demand for this product category remains strong through May before potentially tapering in early summer. Recent demand history shows a sustained high-demand regime: the average demand over the last 7 periods (P7-P13) is approximately 128 units/week (179, 148, 88, 74, 160, 128, 117). While individual weeks fluctuate, the 117 units in P13 suggest the regime is still active. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P9 order arriving in P13). In-transit inventory (425 units) covers orders from P10, P11, P12, and P13. Given the current on-hand (165) and expected arrivals, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the high-demand spring plateau while allowing for the volatility observed in April/May. L remains at default (4) as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime (mid-March to mid-May) for Ladies Denim continues to stabilize at ~128 units/week (P7-P13 average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. We are in the sustained spring demand regime for 'Ladies Denim', where demand has averaged approximately 128 units/week over the last 8 periods (P7-P14). Specifically, recent demand samples (P11-P14: 160, 128, 117, 150) show continued strength with an average of 138.75 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, etc., all L=4). Pipeline inventory is currently 378 units, and on-hand inventory is 183 units. To maintain the service level while managing holding costs, I will setting the mu_hat to capture the average of the last 8 periods (N=8) to reflect the stabilized spring regime, and sigma_hat based on the same window to account for the observed volatility in late April/early May.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is Ladies' Denim. Historical demand analysis shows a sustained spring peak starting around mid-March. In the last 9 periods (P7-P15), demand has averaged 132.4 units per week, with recent weeks (P12-P15) showing 128, 117, 150, and 148 units respectively. This indicates high and stabilized demand as we move from spring into early summer. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 94 and 479 units in-transit (covering orders from periods 12-15), we need to maintain a base stock that accounts for (L+1) = 5 weeks of high demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L) to capture this established high-demand regime, setting N=9 to encompass the period since the April acceleration (P7 onwards).

Carry-over insight: Spring/Early-Summer demand regime for Ladies Denim confirmed stable at high levels: average demand P7-P15 is 132 units/week, significantly higher than the initial Q1 average.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. We are in the late spring/early summer season for Ladies Denim. Demand has stabilized at high levels (Period 16 demand was 113, and the average from Periods 7 to 16 is approximately 128 units/week). Period 16 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory because the order from Period 12 (ordered=0) naturally resulted in no arrivals during Period 16. However, the in-transit pipeline is substantial (633 units), representing orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P1-P11 orders all arrived with L=4). For mu_hat, I am using the average of the last 10 periods (N=10, covering the established higher demand regime from P7 to P16) multiplied by (1+L). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current sustained demand level of ~128 units/week while accounting for the lead time pipeline, balancing the risk of stockouts during the summer peak against holding costs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10, 2019. The product is Ladies Denim (super-skinny jeans). We are currently transitioning from the peak spring season into early summer. Demand has moderated slightly from the April/May peaks (avg ~132) to a more recent average of ~115 (P14-P17). Period 16 saw a stockout due to a missing/delayed shipment from Period 12 (ordered 0 units anyway), but Period 13's order arrived exactly on time in Period 17 (lead time 4). Since Period 12 had 0 units ordered, the 'missing' arrival in Period 16 was expected. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the slightly cooling but still high demand regime (P13-P17 avg: 124). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting parameters to maintain a high service level for this profitable item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), keeping inventory moving as we move deeper into summer.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable lead time of 4 periods (P13 order arrived P17). Demand regime cooling slightly from peak: average demand P14-P17 is ~125 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $246.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for Ladies Denim has entered a lower-stability phase following the spring peak (April-May). Recent demand values (P16-P18: 113, 90, 95) indicate a cooling trend. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is approximately 119 units, with the last two periods dropping below 100. I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this cooling regime (approx. 119/week) while remaining responsive to volatility. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as evidenced by P13 arriving in P17 and P14 arriving in P18), so I will use the default method (promised = 4). With on-hand inventory at 134 and in-transit at 437, pipeline inventory is healthy (~571 units), covering approximately 4.8 periods of the current demand regime. The chosen parameters aim to maintain high service levels while adjusting for the slightly lower early-summer demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Cooling: Average demand for Ladies Denim decreased to ~99 units/week in June (P16-P18), down from the ~130 units/week observed during the spring peak (P7-P15).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for Ladies Denim has entered a cooling phase in June compared to the spring peak. The average demand for the most recent month (P16-P19) is approximately 91 units per week (113, 90, 95, 67), down from the ~130 units/week observed in the spring (March-May). Specifically, the last sample (67) suggests a potential further dip as we move deeper into summer. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (ordered P13 arrived P17, ordered P14 arrived P18, ordered P15 arrived P19). Pipeline inventory (356) and On-hand (227) are high relative to the current cooling demand trend. Therefore, I am reducing mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the June cooling regime and prevent excessive overstocking while maintaining a buffer for seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Cooling confirmed for June: Average demand decreased to ~91 units/week (P16-P19), a ~30% reduction from the spring peak average (~130).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-01. Analyzing demand history, there's a clear downward trend in June as the spring/early-summer peak for 'Ladies Denim' subsides. The last four periods (P17-P20) show demand values of 90, 95, 67, and 34, with an average of 71.5. This is a significant drop from the spring peak average of ~132. The most recent demand (P20) was particularly low (34). We are currently in a transition to a lower summer demand regime. On-hand inventory is high at 347 units, and pipeline inventory is 202 units (orders from P17, P18, P19). With a stable lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using a recent_N approach with N=4 for mu_hat captures this recent cooling trend faster than a global average. Given the current high stock (347) and inward shipments, we expect the OR engine to order 0 or very little, which is appropriate for managing holding costs against declining seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed for late June/early July: Average demand for P17-P20 dropped to ~72 units/week (+/- variance), a ~45% reduction from the spring peak (~132).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/08. We are observing a significant downward trend in demand for Ladies Denim as we move into high summer. Demand for the last four periods (P18-P21) has been 95, 67, 34, and 61, averaging approx 64.25 units per week, which is a -51% drop from the spring peak (~132). On-hand inventory is currently very high at 368 units, which is approximately 5.7 weeks of supply at current demand levels. There are also 120 units in-transit (orders from P18: 41 and P19: 79), expected to arrive in P22 and P23. Total pipeline + on-hand is 488 units. Given high holding costs relative to profit (H=$1, P=$4, q=0.8), we must aggressively lower the base stock to avoid excessive stock-piling. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this cooling trend (P17-P21 demand: 90, 95, 67, 34, 61; avg=69.4). L remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease finalized: July demand (P19-P21) average dropped to ~54 units/week, returning to near-January levels after the Spring peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for Ladies' Denim has significantly cooled after the spring peak, returning to mid-winter levels. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P20-P22) is approximately 53 units/week (34, 61, 64). On-hand inventory is very high at 345 units, which already covers more than 6 weeks of current demand. Pipeline inventory is 79 units (ordered in P19). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the low demand regime (July seasonality), there is no immediate need to order more. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) to reflect the current low-demand environment (average ~64 units) and maintain L at the stable 4-period mark to ensure the OR backend accurately perceives the high stock position relative to lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease finalized: July demand (P19-P22) average settled at ~56 units/week, marking the end of the spring/summer peak and returning to baseline Q1 levels (~50-60).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087014 (Ladies Super-skinny Denim) has transitioned out of its Spring/Early-Summer peak (approx. 130 units/week) into a low-demand mid-summer period. The average demand for the last five periods (P19-P23) is approximately 53 units/week, which is consistent with the initial January/Baseline levels (~50-60). We are currently in a high overstock position (on-hand 383, pipeline 0), as recent shipments (ordered during the peak) arrived after demand had already dropped significantly. With an on-hand inventory of 383 units and a current demand rate of ~53/week, we have over 7 weeks of stock. Since the backend policy uses base stock minus pipeline (base_stock - 0 = base_stock), and the calculated base stock for a ~53 unit/week regime with L=4 will be roughly 350-400 units, the OR engine might still place small orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new lower-demand regime (avg ~53, SD ~15). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand balance, the goal is to stop ordering until inventory depletes naturally to a safer level.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Ladies Denim' has definitively cooled down from the spring peak (~132 units/week) to a summer baseline. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) is approximately 48.5 units/week, which aligns with the initial January baseline. Despite placing zero orders since Period 20, we currently have a large on-hand inventory of 355 units due to the arrival of previous peak-season orders. Pipeline inventory is currently 0 as all older orders (up to P19) have arrived, and no orders were placed in P20-P24. With on-hand inventory (355) significantly exceeding the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), we must continue to avoid ordering to minimize further holding costs. I will set the lead time to its stable 4-period default and use a recent_N of 5 to capture the current lower demand regime (~54 units/week), which will result in a base stock level far below our current stock, effectively suppressing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease finalized: July demand (P19-P24) average settled at ~48 units/week, consistent with a return to baseline Q1 levels after the spring/summer peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ladies Denim' has stabilized at a low baseline level after the spring/summer peak. For the last 7 periods (P19-P25), demand has averaged approximately 41 units/week (67, 34, 61, 64, 41, 28, 32), which is significantly lower than the spring peak of ~132. Specifically, the last 3 periods (P23-P25) have averaged only 34 units. Current on-hand inventory is 323 units, which is extremely high given the current demand regime (covering ~8-10 weeks of demand). There are no units in-transit, but based on the current excess stock, no new orders are required. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I will use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at low summer baseline: Average demand P19-P25 is ~41 units/week, down from spring peak of ~130 units. On-hand inventory is currently excessive (323 units).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087014 (Ladies Denim) has stabilized at a low summer baseline. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P20-P26) is approximately 43 units per week, which is significantly lower than the spring peak of ~130. Current on-hand inventory is 281 units, which is enough to cover over 6 weeks of demand at the current rate (281 / 43 \u2248 6.5 periods). Given the promised lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5), the on-hand inventory already exceeds the necessary base stock to meet target service levels. The OR backend will naturally skip ordering as long as (on-hand + pipeline) exceeds the calculated base_stock. No orders were placed in the last 7 periods, and none are in transit. I will continue to use the recent_N method with N=7 to capture this stabilized low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering while the excess stock is depleted.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal cycle: a low baseline in January (P1), a significant spring peak from March to May (averaging ~130 units), and a steady decline through June and July back to baseline levels. Period 27 (mid-August) saw a sudden demand spike to 88 units. While this could be a random fluctuation, it likely signals the start of 'Back to School' or Autumn seasonality for denim. However, I must be cautious: on-hand inventory is still very high at 193 units, while the recent low-season average (P19-P26) was approximately 41 units. Even with the P27 spike, the inventory covers nearly 5 periods of demand at the new higher rate. I will use a recent_N (N=7 to capture the summer baseline plus the new spike) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to gradually respond to this shift without over-ordering, as the primary goal is currently to bleed off excess inventory to minimize holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential Autumn demand shift detected at Period 27 (Aug 12): demand increased to 88 units, up from the summer baseline of ~41 units observed in P19-P25.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29 (late August), we are observing a transition from the summer baseline (~41 units/week) into a potential autumn regime. Demand in P27 and P28 was 88 and 69 units respectively, suggesting an upward shift as shoppers look for jeans for the fall season. This matches the product description (Ladies' Denim trousers). I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this recent uptick (averaging ~66 units/week). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical consistency. With 124 units on-hand and 86 in-transit, we are reasonably positioned, but the parameter shift will allow the OR backend to maintain safety stock for this rising demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand shift detected in mid-August (P27-P28): demand increased to an average of ~78 units/week, up from the summer baseline of ~41 units observed in P19-P25 (+90%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Historically, Ladies' Denim (the SKU's category) shows an Autumn demand shift starting mid-August as summer concludes and back-to-school/fall shopping begins. Recent demand for Period 27-29 averaged 68 units/week (88, 69, 48), which is an increase from the summer baseline of ~41. Although Period 29 (48) was lower, the trend suggests a move toward a higher Autumn regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (the last 3 periods: P27, P28, P29) to capture this emerging Autumn shift while remaining cautious about over-ordering. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical conclusions. On-hand inventory is 76 with 191 in transit (from P28-P29 orders), totaling 267 units of pipeline inventory, which is sufficient for current demand levels but requires monitoring for the full Autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand shift confirmed starting P27 (Aug 12): Average demand for P27-P29 is ~68 units/week, up from the summer baseline of ~41 units/week (+65%).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a confirmed Autumn demand shift for 'Ladies Denim Trousers'. Since Period 27 (mid-August), demand has increased from the summer baseline of ~41 to an average of ~70 units per week (P27-P30: 88, 69, 48, 74). This likely reflects back-to-school or early autumn shopping patterns. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (2 units), meaning we are heavily reliant on incoming shipments. The 'In-transit' balance of 293 units includes orders from Period 28 (86), Period 29 (105), and Period 30 (102). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, the P28 order is expected in Period 32. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods throughout the history (last seen in P23 arriving from P19). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this autumn regime (~70 units/week), as the summer baseline is no longer relevant. L remains default (4). sigma_hat will use the same N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P27-P30 is 69.75 units/week, a +70% increase over the summer baseline (~41).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 16, 2019. We are in a confirmed Autumn demand regime for Ladies Denim. Average demand from P27 to P31 is approximately 72 units/week (88, 69, 48, 74, 83), which is a significant increase from the summer baseline of ~41. Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0, and the last observed arrival was in Period 23. Orders from Period 28 onwards (approx 378 units total in-transit) are expected to start arriving from Period 32 (today) onwards, based on the stable lead time of 4 periods. Since the current demand regime has stabilized over the last 5 periods (N=5), I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the summer lows to the autumn levels. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (mid-August to mid-September) for Ladies Denim stabilized at ~72 units/week (P27-P31), up from the summer baseline of ~41 units/week.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Autumn demand regime for Ladies Denim. Analysis of demand since mid-August (P27-P32) shows an average of ~68.7 units per week [88, 69, 48, 74, 83, 50]. Although Period 32 demand was lower (50), the overall trend supports a shift from the summer low (~41) to an Autumn baseline. On-hand inventory is low (36), but significant inventory is in-transit (306 units across P29-P32). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this Autumn regime (P27-P32). This ensures base stock levels cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) without over-ordering as the pipeline fills.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. We are in an Autumn demand regime for Ladies Denim, which began around mid-August (Period 27). The average demand from Period 27 to Period 33 is approximately 71.4 units/week (88, 69, 48, 74, 83, 50, 88). This is a significant increase from the summer baseline of ~41 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P32 and P33). Currently, on-hand inventory is 53 units and in-transit is 234 units (from orders in P30, P31, P32, P33). Total pipeline inventory is 287. Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~72, the expected needed inventory is 360. Our current total of 287 indicates a need for additional orders to reach the target service level, especially as we are out of the summer slump and into a more active sales period. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the Autumn shift for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (mid-August to late-September) for Ladies Denim continues to stabilize at ~72 units/week (P27-P33 average).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in the Autumn demand regime for Ladies Denim, which historically showed a shift around mid-August. Analyzing the most recent period (P27 to P34) excluding the summer baseline, the average demand is approximately 68 units/week (P27:88, P28:69, P29:48, P30:74, P31:83, P32:50, P33:88, P34:44). Although recent demand values have fluctuated (88 followed by 44), the broader Autumn average remains stable around 70. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P32, P33, and P34). Current on-hand is 111, with 232 units in-transit (orders from P31: 85, P32: 14, P33: 33, P34: 100). Total pipeline (including OH) is 343 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At ~70 units/week, required inventory is ~350, suggesting our current pipeline is nearly sufficient but needs slight adjustment for volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P27-P34) to capture the Autumn regime mean and variance accurately.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. We are in the Autumn demand regime for Ladies Denim. Demand has stabilized over the last 9 periods (P27-P35) with an average of approximately 67 units/week. Recent periods show some fluctuation (P33: 88, P34: 44, P35: 60), but the overarching regime initiated in mid-August remains consistent. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 136 units and in-transit is 179 units (from P32-P35 orders). Pipelines are well-stocked for current demand levels. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the Autumn regime mean and volatility, ensuring we maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) without over-ordering as the season progresses.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in the Autumn season for Ladies Denim. Demand has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P27-P36) at an average of 64.3 units/week. While there was an initial Autumn surge peaking around P31, demand in the most recent five periods (P32-P36) has averaged slightly lower at 56 units/week. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Inventory management is currently healthy with 111 on-hand and 219 in-transit. Given the high service level target (Profit $4 / Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the overall Autumn regime mean while allowing for recent volume variance, ensuring we stay stocked for any late October/November fluctuations before the winter transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (mid-August to mid-October) for Ladies Denim stabilized at an average of 64 units/week (P27-P36), representing a sustained +55% increase over the summer baseline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The Autumn demand regime for Ladies Denim (starts mid-August) has stabilized. Over the last 11 periods (P27-P37), the average demand is 62.7 units/week. While there was a slight decrease in the most recent periods (P34-P37 average is 47.5), the overall Autumn average remains significantly higher than the summer trough (~41). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37. On-hand inventory is 97 units, with 213 units in-transit (orders from P34-P37). Total pipeline inventory is 310 units. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At an average demand of ~63, this requires approximately 315 units. Current inventory (310) is nearly perfectly aligned with the stable Autumn regime. I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-summer baseline, and keep lead time at the default promised value of 4.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the Autumn/Winter transition for Ladies Denim. The Autumn demand regime (starting P27, Aug 12) has shown an average demand of approximately 63 units/week (P27-P38). The most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) show a slightly lower but stable average of ~50 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 140 units on hand and 152 in-transit, our total inventory position is 292. Using the recent 5-period average (50 units) and a lead time of 4, the target pipeline inventory (L+1 demand) would be around 250 units. Our current position of 292 suggests we are slightly overstocked relative to the recent cooling trend (avg ~50). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent stabilization at ~50 units, and continue with the calculate method for L as lead times have been perfectly stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter transition demand (P34-P38) has stabilized at a lower average of ~50 units/week compared to the early Autumn peak of ~70 units/week.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11, entering the late Autumn/early Winter period. Demand has transitioned from the Autumn peak (~70 units) to a more stable late-season level of approx 50 units/week over the last 6 periods (P34-P39: 44, 60, 39, 47, 57, 50; average = 49.5). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 122 units, and in-transit is 120 units (from P36: 54, P37: 27, P38: 39). Total pipeline is 242. Given the high stock relative to the current 50/week demand regime, and the high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0), I will target the current regime mean of ~50 using N=6 to avoid over-ordering during this stabilization phase. Sigma will also be set to the recent regime's volatility to reflect the current period's behavior.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a late Autumn/Winter regime with an average of approximately 51 units/week over the last 5 periods (P36-P40: 39, 47, 57, 50, 51). This is a noticeable decrease from the early Autumn peak of ~70 units. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P34-P36 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). On-hand inventory is 125 units and in-transit is 87 units (from orders in P37-P40), totaling 212 units of pipeline inventory. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of ~51, the expected demand is ~255 units. Our current pipeline (212) is slightly below this, so a small replenishment order is appropriate. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime, and recent_N=10 for L to reflect the high stability of the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand regime (starting mid-October) stabilized at ~51 units/week (P36-P40), a decrease from the earlier Autumn peak (~70). Lead time remains highly stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The Autumn/Winter demand regime for these super-skinny jeans has stabilized at approximately 50-51 units per week (periods 36-41). Demand in Period 41 was 38 units, slightly below the recent average but within expected variance for this regime. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, with orders from Period 37 arriving exactly on time. Total inventory (on-hand 114 + in-transit 105 = 219) covers roughly 4.3 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain the target service level as we approach the end of the year, I will continue using a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for both demand and volatility, as this captures the specific stabilized winter regime starting mid-October (P37-P41). Method L is set to 'calculate' given the high reliability of the 4-period lead time.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ladies Denim' showed a significant spike in Period 42 (133 units), which is more than double the stabilized average of ~51 units/week observed since mid-October. Given the date (Dec 2), this is likely the beginning of a holiday shopping surge or a Black Friday/Cyber Monday related peak. My strategy is to increase the demand forecast (mu_hat) significantly to account for this likely seasonal shift, using the recent surge as a primary signal. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Inventory levels (20 on-hand + 104 in-transit) are relatively low given the spike, so setting a higher base stock via a higher mu_hat and \u03c3\u0302 is necessary to prevent stockouts during this potential peak period.

Carry-over insight: Significant holiday demand surge detected at Period 42: demand jumped to 133 units from a baseline of ~51 units (+160%), likely signaling the start of December holiday seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the December holiday season (Period 44, Dec 9). A significant demand surge was observed in Period 42 (133 units), followed by a drop to 43 units in Period 43 (likely due to stockout, as sold units were capped at 20). Total demand in the last two weeks (P42-P43) averaged 88 units/week. Given the proximity to Christmas and the 'Ladies Denim' category, high volatility is expected to continue through the end of the year (Period 47). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 263 units (orders from P40-P43). Specifically, orders from P40 (21 units) and P41 (45 units) are expected to arrive in P44 and P45 respectively. To protect against the holiday peak and high variance (demonstrated by the jump from ~50 to 133), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent surge, and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility observed in P42. L remains 'calculate' as lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: Period 42 showed a jump to 133 units (+160% over Oct/Nov baseline). Period 43 demand was 43 but constrained by stockout; true demand likely remains high through Period 47.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak (Period 45). Demand spiked significantly in Period 42 (133 units) but has been constrained by stockouts in Period 43 (sold 20 of 43) and Period 44 (sold 21 of 31). The 'true' holiday demand is likely much higher than these stockout-limited figures, mirroring the early December surge. We must ensure we have enough inventory arriving for the final weeks. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders placed in P43 (159 units) and P44 (105 units) are in-transit and expected to arrive in P47 and P48 respectively. To cover the remaining periods and the potential for sustained high demand/stock recovery, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (Period 42-44) to capture the holiday surge, while acknowledging that the absolute demand values are low due to stockouts. Therefore, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 550 ((1+4) * 110) to reflect a forecast of ~110 units per week for the remainder of the holiday peak, avoiding under-ordering during this critical window.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a significant December holiday demand peak (Periods 42, 45). Period 45 recorded a demand of 204 units, the highest in the history of this SKU. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in Periods 43-45. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P41 order arrived in P45). With the simulation ending at Period 47, orders placed now (P46) will not arrive in time to satisfy demand within the game window (Arrival = P46 + 4 = P50). However, per the objective to maximize reward across all periods and the backend's capped policy, I will maintain parameters that reflect the current holiday demand regime. Demand for P42-P45 averaged ~103 units, but would have been higher without stockouts (P43 and P44 sold 0/21 units against likely higher latent demand). Given the spike to 204 in P45, I will utilize a recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this high-demand period and adjust sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during the holiday season.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed: Period 45 demand reached 204 units, significantly exceeding the previous spring peak (~132). Late December/Early January demand remains exceptionally high for Ladies Denim.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the December holiday season for SKU 399087014. Recent demand data confirms a significant surge: P42 demand was 133, P45 was 204, and P46 was 140. Stockouts in P43-P46 (on-hand 0 at start of demand resolution) indicate that true demand is likely even higher than selling figures. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is high (629 units), including large orders from P43 (159), P44 (105), P45 (179), and P46 (186). Based on the 4-period lead time, the P43 order is expected to arrive during P47. Given the transition from late December to early January, we expect demand to remain elevated but potentially start tapering off post-holidays. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility holiday regime (P42-P46) which averages ~130 units/week despite stockouts. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current high demand while the existing pipeline arrives to refill the empty on-hand stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
