Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a pair of high-waisted skinny jeans. Historical demand shows 5 samples: [25, 26, 20, 32, 48]. There is a visible upward trend in the last two weeks, specifically the spike to 48 on 2019/02/04. February often sees early spring fashion interest. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time is 4 periods, we need to ensure the pipeline is filled. Promised lead time (L) is 4, meaning the review + lead period is (1+4)=5. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent upward trajectory (avg of 20, 32, 48 is 33.3, which scaled by 1+L=5 gives ~167). I will use 'default' for sigma_hat to provide a conservative buffer based on the full volatility observed so far.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'High-waisted skinny denim' from the 'Divided' collection. Historical demand provided is [25, 26, 20, 32, 48]. Note: The Period 1 demand (from history) was 48, which matches the last provided sample date (2019-02-04 vs Period 1 2019-02-11). There is a clear upward trend in demand over the last two periods (32 to 48), likely due to moving into the mid-February spring fashion refresh. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 52 in-transit (ordered in P1). Since promised lead time is 4, this P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5. For parameters, I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent growth trend (avg: 33.3) and set lead time to 'default' (4).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand remains 0 because the first order (placed P1) is subject to a 4-period lead time and isn't expected until P5 Arrival Resolution. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 25, 26, 20, 32, 48 (pre-game) and then 48, 65 in Periods 1-2. The mean of the last 3 samples is approximately 43.6, while the mean of the last 2 is 56.5. Given the product is 'superstretch denim' in February/March, we are likely seeing a spring inventory build-up or a seasonal increase in denim interest. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent growth (approx 53.6 units/period). With L=4 (promised), the OR backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4)*53.6 = 268. The current pipeline is 110 units (P1: 52, P2: 58), which is well below the required base stock (approx 268 + safety stock), triggering another significant order to cover the (L+1) window. I'll use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen in the move from 48 to 65.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is a SKU of denim trousers. Historical demand for the first three periods (48, 65, 48) shows an upward shift compared to the initial five sample points (25, 26, 20, 32, 48). The mean of the last 3 periods is ~53.7, whereas the overall mean (samples + game history) is ~39. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Because L=4, orders placed in Period 1-3 have not arrived yet (first arrival expected Period 5). The 'in-transit' total of 192 units accounts for orders in P1 (52), P2 (58), and P3 (82). With Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) being equal, the service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. At this service level, the target base stock is simply the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (avg ~54/period), and 'default' for L as no evidence currently contradicts the L=4 promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 2019: Mean increased from ~25-30 to ~50-60 (+100%).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The SKU is Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim, a staple fashion item. Historically, demand shifted from ~25-30 units in Jan to ~45-65 units starting in Feb, likely due to spring fashion cycles. In-transit inventory is currently 262 units (orders from P1-P4: 52+58+82+70). Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since P1's order was placed in the decision phase of P1, it should arrive during P5's arrival phase (visible at start of P6). Thus, no arrivals are expected yet according to the promised lead time. Demand in the last 4 weeks (48, 65, 48, 43) averages 51 units. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this higher February/March regime. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=4 to project 5 periods of demand (L+1), reflecting the current stabilized higher mean. L remains at default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a skinny denim trouser. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (including the 5 explicit samples and the game history) shows a clear regime shift: initial demand was ~25-32, but since Feb 4th (Period 1 in game history), it has stabilized around a higher mean: 48, 65, 48, 43, 36. The mean of these last five periods is 48. Period 5 saw the first arrival (52 units from Period 1), confirming the promised lead time L=4 is accurate (4 periods). Current on-hand is 16, with 210 in transit (from Periods 2, 3, and 4). Since L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With a mean of 48, the expected demand is 240. Pipeline inventory (16 + 210 = 226) is slightly below this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture this higher-demand regime while maintaining the promised lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product is a SKU of skinny denim trousers. Based on historical data, we observed a demand shift at the beginning of February where demand moved from the mid-20s into a higher regime. For the last 6 periods (Period 1-6), demand has averaged 47.0 units (48, 65, 48, 43, 36, 42), which is consistent with the previously identified shift. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6), matching the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 32 units with 166 units in-transit (P3: 82, P4: 70, P6: 14). Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~47/period, we need ~235 units in the pipeline. With 198 units already (on-hand + in-transit), the system is healthy but needs modest replenishment. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime and default for Lead Time and Sigma.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is April 1st, 2019. The product is a pair of high-waisted skinny jeans. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting in early February (Period 1), where demand jumped from a mean of ~25 units/period to approximately 49.1 units/period (average of the last 7 periods: 48, 65, 48, 43, 36, 42, 62). Lead time is stable at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1, 2, and 3. On-hand inventory is 52 units with 121 units in-transit (orders from P4, P6, P7). A lead time of 4 means we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent demand data (last 7 periods) captures the current regime more accurately than including the lower January values. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to reflect this higher mean, and sigma_hat is also calculated based on the same recent period to account for the increased volatility observed in this new regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim TRS', which experienced a demand regime shift around Period 4 as previously noted. Reviewing demand samples from the last 8 periods (48, 65, 48, 43, 36, 42, 62, 44), the mean is approximately 48.5 units/period. The lead time of 4 periods has been consistent for all 4 orders that have arrived (Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived with L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 78, with 118 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8). To set the base stock level (target pipeline inventory), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (avg ~45.6 for the last 5 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L will remain 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is skinny denim, which typically sees consistent demand in spring. Since the regime shift identified in Period 4, demand has stabilized with a mean of approximately 49.3 units over the last 9 periods (P1-P9). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals for P1, P2, P3, and P4 orders all explicitly confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. In Period 9, 'arrived=0' is expected because no order was placed in Period 5. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering Periods 5-9) to capture the current demand level (~47.4 average) over the (L+1)=5 period horizon. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (149) plus on-hand (25) covers about 3.5 weeks of demand, and this setting should trigger a replenishment order to maintain the service level where profit equals holding cost (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently confirmed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals of P1-P4 orders). Demand stabilized in the 45-55 range following the initial February spike.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a skinny denim item. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 6 arrival (14 units) was insufficient to meet Period 10 demand (41). However, Period 5 (placed in P1) arrived exactly at L=4. Period 6 (placed in P2) arrived at L=4. Period 7 (placed in P3) arrived at L=4. Period 8 (placed in P4) arrived at L=4. There was no arrival in Period 9 because no order was placed in Period 5. Period 10 (placed in P6) arrived at L=4. This confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods. Revenue per unit is $1 and holding cost is $1, implying a target service level of 50%, though the OR engine's internal cap logic will aim for a higher safety margin. Demand since the February surge (Period 1-10) has a mean of 48.2 and a standard deviation of 10.1. There is no evidence of a new regime shift or seasonality for late April yet. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the post-initial-volatility behavior.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (2019/4/29). Historical data shows a clear shift in demand starting in Feb 2019, stabilizing around a mean of 45-50 units per period. Recent samples (P7-P11) show demand levels of 62, 44, 53, 41, and 43. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to reflect this stabilized regime. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P5-P11 arrivals), so I will use 'default' (promised=4). Note: Period 10 and 11 faced stockouts (on-hand dropped to 0) despite pipeline arrivals, likely due to small order sizes in P6 and P7. The In-transit quantity is currently 204 (shipped in P8, P9, P10, P11), and the P8 order (67 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P12). Using a recent_N=5 for sigma_hat captures the current volatility in this stable regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381001' (Skinny Denim) has shown a demand regime shift starting in Period 1 (Feb 2019), moving from an initial average of ~25 in January to a consistent range of 40-55. The most recent 8 periods (P5-P12) show a mean demand of approximately 46.1, which is stable. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on multiple arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12). Note that the Period 5 order appears to be missing or skipped (P9 had 0 arrivals), but the rhythm resumed thereafter. With on-hand inventory at 23 and 176 units in transit, we are forecasting for a 5-period window (L+1). I will use recent_N=8 to capture this stabilized post-spike demand regime while ignoring the pre-February data. L is set to default (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use N=8 to reflect the 46.1 average demand and its associated volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 13, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 621381001 (High-waisted skinny jeans) shows a significant shift in February, stabilizing thereafter. Analysis of the last 10 periods (P4-P13) shows mean demand of 43.6 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P9-P13) show a slight cooling to 40.8 units, with Period 13 dropping to 23 (though this might be an outlier). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Since on-hand is 31 and in-transit is 175 (covering P10-P13 orders), we are well-positioned for the lead time horizon. I'm using N=10 for demand to capture the stable post-February regime while smoothing out the recent lower volumes. The profit/holding ratio is 1.0, implying a 50% target service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-February spike: mean demand for P4-P13 is approx 44 units/period, down from the peak but higher than initial January samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), the demand for 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized following the initial February surge. Over the last 10 periods (P5-P14), demand has averaged 42.9 units per period, while the most recent 5 periods (P10-P14) show a slightly lower average of 37.4 units. The 'carry-over insight' from P14 noted a mean of 44, but the subsequent weak demand of 36 in P14 suggests a cooling trend heading into late spring/summer for this specific denim SKU. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P12, P13, and P14). In-transit inventory (122 units) consists of orders from P11 (43), P12 (39), P13 (30), and P14 (10). Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend OR target service level is 50%. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the stable regime post-February while buffering against the recent slight decline, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for SKU 621381001 showing signs of cooling in May: 5-period average (P10-P14) dropped to 37.4 from the previous 10-period average of 43.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the SKU (High-waisted denim) is entering the summer season. Historical demand peaked in Feb/March and has recently stabilized at a lower level. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is 37.6 units, compared to the peak average of ~50. I will prioritize this recent trend to avoid overstocking, as holding costs are significant ($1.0/unit). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P10 and P11 orders arriving exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is healthy at 62 units, and the pipeline (111 units) is well-populated. I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime and 'default' for L to maintain the promised 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Mean demand for the period P10-P15 (May) has settled at ~38 units/period, roughly 15-20% lower than the early spring peak.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for the 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized in May. The demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has averaged 37.6 units, reflecting a cooling from the early spring peak. Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P12 order arrived in P16). On-hand inventory is 55 units and in-transit is 88 (orders from P13, P14, P15, P16). Given that Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level (z=0), meaning the base stock will target the median demand. I am setting L to default (4), mu_hat to use the recent 7 periods (P10-P16) to capture the current stable demand regime (average ~38), and sigma_hat to default to ensure the OR engine uses the standard deviation from all available data for safety, as recent volatility is present.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18 (June 10th), we are managing a 'Divided Collection' skinny denim SKU. Historical data shows that while demand cooled slightly in May (~38 units/period), the last observation in Period 17 showed a surge to 69 units, likely driven by seasonal summer shopping or mid-year promotions. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to capture this recent volatility without over-reacting to a single high data point, but given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5), the OR backend will target the mean demand. Current on-hand is low (16), while in-transit is 110 (orders from P14-P17). I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the post-April stabilization and the recent spike, providing a balanced forecast for the L+1 window. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in June: Period 17 saw a demand of 69 units, significantly higher than the May average of ~38 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a mid-June period (2019/6/17). Historical analysis shows a significant demand surge in June: Period 17 (69 units) and Period 18 (66 units), compared to the May average of ~38 units. This indicates a summer seasonality shift for high-waisted denim. The current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand) due to high demand and small replenishment arrivals (only 10 units in P18). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address the higher demand regime and prevent stockouts during this peak, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use the last 3 periods (P16-P18), which capture the recent surge (avg ~60.3 units/period). I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in June. In-transit remains high (164 units), but the backend OR will cap orders as needed to prevent overstocking once these units arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: June demand (P17-P18) increased to ~67.5 units/period (+75% vs. May average of 38), likely due to summer seasonality for denim.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for SKU 621381001 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) has shifted significantly upward during June (P17-P19), with demand values of 69, 66, and 73. This confirms a new regime characterized by an average of approx 69.3 units/period, compared to the previous May stabilization of ~38 units. This surge is likely driven by summer seasonality for distressed denim. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P15 order arrival. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the high demand outpacing historical arrivals. To prevent further stockouts and align with the new demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this new higher mean. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand state. L is maintained at calculate to reflect the consistent 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift starting June (Period 17): Average demand increased from ~38 to ~69 units/period (+82%), likely due to summer seasonality for denim products.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1, 2019), the SKU '621381001' is experiencing a significant stockout. High demand in June (avg ~69 units/period in P17-P19) exhausted on-hand inventory, and the low arrival volume from orders placed during the May cooling period (P13-P16) was insufficient to meet this summer demand spike. For Period 20, the demand dropped to 36, but this appears to be a censored demand observation due to stockout (only 16 units were available to sell). Given the 'Divided Collection' and 'hard-worn denim' attributes, summer peak demand is likely still active. I will set the lead time (L) to 4 periods based on consistent historical confirmation. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 (covering P17-P20) to capture the elevated summer demand regime despite the stock-out dampened P20 figure. This ensures the base stock (covering 1+L = 5 periods) is calculated against the current high-demand environment (~60-70 units) to replenish the pipeline and maximize future service levels.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the 22nd period (July 2019). The SKU (skinny denim trousers) is currently experiencing a sustained high-demand regime that began in June (Period 17). The demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has been 69, 66, 73, 36, and 77, respectively. Although Period 20 showed a dip to 36, the surrounding weeks consistently point to a mean demand of approximately 64-65 units. On-hand inventory is 0, indicating lost sales in recent periods (P18-P21) due to stockouts. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high-demand summer seasonality and recent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=5 (P17-P21) to capture the current regime which is significantly higher than the spring mean (~38). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the current ~64 units/period demand plus a buffer for volatility, while L=4 ensures coverage for the lead time and the current review period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 context: Current date is 2019/07/15. Demand history indicates a summer shift (June/July) for this skinny denim trousers SKU. While June saw a spike to ~69 units/period, July demand so far (P21-P22) has averaged 65 units (77, 53). The carry-over insight from P20 remains valid but needs refinement as the peak stabilizes. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is critically low (11 units), and we have faced frequent stockouts (P18-P21) due to underestimating this seasonal surge. At P22, demand was 53, lower than the P21 spike of 77, but still significantly higher than the May average of 38. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0), I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=6 (covering the summer period P17-P22) to capture this higher mean (~62 units/period). For sigma_hat, I will use N=6 to reflect the current high volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at the 'default' promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 17-22) confirmed for denim SKU: Mean demand for the period is ~62 units/period, significantly higher than the spring mean of 38-44.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 is 2019/07/22, placing us at the backend of the summer season for this skinny denim SKU. Historical demand analysis shows a distinct regime shift at Period 17 (early June), where demand spiked from a spring average of ~38 to a summer average of ~62 units/period. The last seven periods (P17-P23) have shown demand values of 69, 66, 73, 36, 77, 53, and 53 respectively. While recent demand has softened slightly (53 units in the last two weeks), the summer regime remains the most relevant anchor. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this summer volatility and mean (~61 units/period). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion of orders from P17, P18, and P19. Pipeline inventory is currently 220 units (orders from P20-P23), which covers roughly 3.6 periods of current demand. With a profit/holding ratio of 1.0 (implying a 50% service level target), maintaining a base stock of (L+1) periods of demand (~305 units) while accounting for the high volatility seen in the summer is appropriate.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. This SKU (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) is likely exiting its peak summer demand regime. Looking at recent trends, demand for the last 8 periods (since June) averaged 56.6, but the most recent period (P24) showed a significant drop to 27 units, suggesting a potential end-of-season cooling. The 'Carry-over Insights' previously noted a summer average of ~62 units, while the recent 4-period mean (P21-P24) is 52.5. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the summer elevated state while acknowledging the potential downward trend. Sigma remains high due to high volatility in the summer data (range 27 to 77). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (190) plus on-hand (88) is substantial, so a cautious mu_hat helps avoid overstocking as we approach August.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak for Denim TRS appears to be cooling in late July: Demand dropped to 27 in Period 24 after a June-July average of ~61.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim TRS) is entering August (Period 26). Historical analysis shows a clear summer demand peak starting in June (Period 17) with mean demand ~62 units, which followed a spring average of ~40. However, the last two periods (P24-P25) have seen lower demand (27 and 54), suggesting the summer peak may be tapering off as we head into late summer/pre-fall. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 66 and a significant pipeline of 164 units (Total coverage = 230), and given the cooling trend, I will set mu_hat to reflect a slightly more conservative demand estimate. I'm choosing recent_N = 9 (P17-P25) for mu_hat to capture the full summer regime including the recent slowdown, which averages approximately 55 units per period. This balances the high mid-summer demand with the recent cooling signals.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak for Denim TRS (reached ~62 avg in P17-P23) shows signs of normalization in late July/August, with recent demand averaging ~55 over P17-P25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim TRS) is a high-waisted skinny denim product. Historically, lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. Current demand shows high volatility as we transition from late summer into August. Period 26 demand spiked to 83, the highest recorded to date, countering the previous 'cooling' trend observed in Period 24. This suggests August may see robust demand or back-to-school preparation for denim. The mean demand for the 'summer' regime (P17-P26) is approximately 62.6 units/period. Given the recent variability (ranges between 27 and 83), I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this higher-volatility summer average while acknowledging the recent spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to account for the increased standard deviation (approx 17-18). On-hand inventory is 51 with 149 in-transit, which covers expected demand over the lead time, but the high demand in Period 26 warrants maintaining a healthy base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike in August: Period 26 demand (83) is the highest recorded, suggesting denim demand remains very strong despite late July fluctuations.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand for 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' has shown extreme volatility in August, with Period 27 demand hitting 96 units, following 83 in Period 26. This indicates that rather than cooling down, the summer/back-to-school demand for denim is peaking. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory due to this surge. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward trend (demand moving from ~55 to nearly 100), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use a shorter recent window (N=4) to capture this late-August acceleration. This will increase the base stock to prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period while balancing against the holding cost which equals profit. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the recent window to account for the increased volatility seen in the last month.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge in August (P26-P27): Mean demand increased to 89.5 units/period, significantly exceeding the previous summer average of ~62. This likely reflects back-to-school seasonality for denim products.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Skinny Denim) is currently experiencing a massive demand surge likely linked to back-to-school seasonality. Demand in the last three periods (P26-P28) reached 83, 96, and 103, resulting in repetitive stockouts (ending inventory 0 for P27 and P28). The mean demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 94 units/period, compared to the summer average of ~62. To capture this 'back-to-school' regime and rebuild towards a healthy base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility (std dev ~10 units) during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is currently full (264 units), but with demand hitting triple digits, aggressive parameters are necessary to ensure future arrivals meet this sustained high demand.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed (late August): Mean demand for P26-P28 increased to ~94 units/period, causing immediate stockouts.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-demand regime, which I've identified as a 'back-to-school' surge starting around Period 26 (early August). Historically, demand was ~38 units/period in May, ~62 units/period in June/July, and has now surged to an average of ~94.75 units/period over the last four weeks (P26: 83, P27: 96, P28: 103, P29: 97). The inventory position is currently strained, with zero on-hand units and 369 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, I expect significant arrivals to begin in Period 31 (from orders placed in P27 onwards). For Period 30, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new elevated mean of ~95 units, ensuring the (L+1) calculation reflects the current surge. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 4 periods to account for the increased volatility during this peak. Lead time L is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge (P26-P29) for Denim SKU has stabilized at a high mean of ~95 units/period, maintaining the +50% increase over the summer average.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Denim Trousers) is currently in a high-demand regime driven by back-to-school seasonality. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 30 has stabilized at approximately 94.6 units per period, which is a significant increase from the summer average of approx 60. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to persistent stockouts as demand has outpaced arrivals from the lower-volume summer orders. The lead time remains steady at 4 periods. Since the most recent demand regime (P26-P30) shows consistent high volume (~95 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this peak demand accurately. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects 'back-to-school' levels (approx 475 units across 5 periods) rather than longer-term averages. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to continue using the confirmed 4-period historical average.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical demand for this denim SKU peaked during the late August back-to-school season (P26-P29, mean ~95). However, the most recent observation (Period 31) shows demand softening to 67 units, suggesting the peak is passing. We are entering mid-September, when retail demand for summer-targeted 'worn' denim typically begins to normalize before late autumn shifts. I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this transition from the peak (95) to the current lower level (67), resulting in a calculated mean of approx 92 units/period (total mu_hat = (1+4)*92 = 460). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (384) plus current on-hand (22) is 406, which is slightly below our targeted base stock, justifying a replenishment order to maintain service levels through the remainder of September.

Carry-over insight: Demand began normalizing post-back-to-school peak: Period 31 demand (67) is ~30% lower than the P26-P29 average (95).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant 'back-to-school' surge (P26-P30) where demand averaged ~95 units/period, followed by a clear normalization phase in the last two periods (P31-P32) where demand dropped to ~65 units/period. The Carry-over insights and recent data confirm that the peak has passed, likely moving into a steady autumn regime for denim. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 75 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 319 units (including large orders from the peak period), the focus must shift to preventing overstock as demand cools. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend (averaging P30-P32: ~75 units/period) while ignoring the extreme peak of late August. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current post-peak levels rather than the historical spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand normalization confirmed post-back-to-school: Mean demand (P31-P32) has decreased to ~65 units/period, a ~30% reduction from the P26-P30 peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late September (Period 34). The product is a skinny denim trouser, which saw a massive demand spike during the back-to-school season (late August to early September, P26-P30) with demand averaging ~95 units. As identified in the carry-over insights for Period 33, demand has begun to normalize. However, P33 itself saw a high demand of 110, suggesting the 'cooling' may be inconsistent or that late September still holds significant volume before a likely October dip. The pipeline is currently full (208 units in-transit), with large orders from P30 (105 units) expected to arrive next period. Given the on-hand inventory of 76 and the expected arrival of 105, we are well-positioned for the immediate future. To avoid overstocking as the peak season ends, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 (covering P30-P33) which averages ~83.5 units, capturing the transition from peak to normalization. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-back-to-school demand normalization (P31-P33) shows high variance: demand fluctuated between 63 and 110, averaging ~80 units, compared to the P26-P30 peak of ~95.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-demand phase following the back-to-school surge, although volatility is significant. Looking at the last 4 periods (P31-P34), demand was 67, 63, 110, and 103, averaging 85.75. This is slightly lower than the P26-P30 peak (~95) but significantly higher than the summer average (~62). Period 34 demand resumed a very high level (103), suggesting that demand hasn't fully normalized yet. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 78 and in-transit at 224, the pipeline is reasonably stocked, but given the high variance (std of ~24 over the last 4 periods) and the potential for sustained high demand in October, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current high-but-volatile demand regime while maintaining a responsive sigma_hat to buffer against the recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Post-back-to-school demand (P31-P34) has settled at a high mean of ~86 units/period with significant volatility (range 63-110), maintaining a higher plateau than the summer average.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Jade Trash Skinny Denim) is currently in a post-back-to-school normalization phase. After peaking at ~95 units during late August (P26-P30), demand has stayed on a high plateau, averaging approximately 82 units per period over the last 5 weeks (P31-P35: 67, 63, 110, 103, 67). Although there is significant weekly volatility (range 63-110), the mean remains substantially higher than the summer average of ~62. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as evidenced by the consistent arrival of orders from P27 through P31. Since the product is 'high-waisted jeans' and we are moving into mid-October, demand is expected to remain steady or slightly increase with cooler weather. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period history and use a 'recent_N' of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-peak plateau (averaging ~82) while accounting for the high recent variance, ensuring the OR backend maintains sufficient safety stock for this high-margin/high-holding-cost balanced scenario.

Carry-over insight: Post-back-to-school demand plateau (P31-P35) confirmed at ~82 units/period, showing ~14% decrease from the peak but remaining significantly above summer levels (~62).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a post-back-to-school demand phase. While demand peaked around 95-100 units in late August/early September, it has since settled into a high-plateau regime. The last two periods (P35-P36) show demand of 67 and 55 units respectively, suggesting a normalization toward a mean of approximately 60-70 units as we enter late October. The carry-over insights correctly identified a plateau at ~82, but the most recent two weeks show a further softening. I will use a recent_N of 6 periods (P31-P36) to calculate mu_hat, which captures this normalization (average demand in this window is ~77.5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 59 with significant in-transit (296), which covers the upcoming 4-5 periods of demand at current rates.

Carry-over insight: Demand normalizing further in October: Mean demand for P35-P36 is 61 units, compared to the P31-P34 average of 85.8, indicating the post-back-to-school plateau is settling lower.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for SKU 621381001 (Denim Trousers) has transitioned from the high back-to-school peak (P26-P30, avg ~95) towards a cooler October level. Although P37 showed a spike to 90, the recent 5-period average (P33-P37) is approximately 85 units. However, looking at the broader post-peak period (P31-P37), the mean is 79 units. Given the seasonal nature of denim, we are likely seeing a transition into late autumn/winter demand. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 329 units in transit (representing orders from P34-P37). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the demand stabilization after the back-to-school surge, while providing enough buffer for the observed volatility (sigma) in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in October (P35-P37): demand appears to be fluctuating between 55 and 90, settling at a lower plateau than the back-to-school peak, averaging ~79 units/period since Period 31.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are moving past the secondary 'back-to-school' and October plateau into the pre-holiday season for denim. Demand in the most recent periods (P35-P38) has been 67, 55, 90, 46, showing significant volatility but a downward trend compared to the Sept peak (avg ~64.5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The shipment from P33 (0 units ordered) correctly resulted in no arrival in P37, while the P34 order arrived in P38 as expected. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 (covering P31-P38) to capture the post-peak normalization mean of ~75.1 units/period. This protects against stockouts while recognizing the cooling trend from the earlier plateau of ~86.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in Oct/Nov: Mean demand (P31-P38) has settled at ~75 units/period, down from the back-to-school peak of ~95 but remaining higher than the summer average of ~62.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are entering the pre-holiday season. Looking at recent demand history from Period 31 to Period 39, we have seen a gradual decline from the back-to-school peak (avg ~95) down to a lower plateau. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 9 periods (P31-P39) is approximately 70.3 units. However, the last two periods (P38, P39) have shown a significant drop to 46 and 32 units respectively. This suggests the post-peak normalization is continuing or transitioning into a lower winter baseline before any holiday spike. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this shift while maintaining some buffer, as the most recent single-digit samples might be outliers or the start of a deep trough. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. Inventory levels are currently healthy with 169 on-hand and 175 in-transit, so a conservative mu_hat setting using recent_N=9 will prevent excessive holding costs during this cooling phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in November: Mean demand for P31-P39 has settled at ~70 units, but the most recent two periods (P38-P39) show a further drop to an average of 39 units, indicating seasonal cooling for the Denim TRS SKU.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November). The demand for this denim SKU has entered a significant cooling phase following the back-to-school peak. Recent demand for the last three periods (P38-P40) has been 46, 32, and 45, averaging ~41 units/period. This is a sharp drop from the September/October plateau of ~80+ units. Current on-hand inventory is 173, and in-transit is 134, totaling 307 units. At the current demand rate, this covers over 7 periods of demand, which is well above the (L+1) requirement of 5 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the observed seasonal decline, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (last 3 periods) to prevent further overstocking and minimize holding costs while the backend OR policy naturally caps orders.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal cooling confirmed for mid-November: Demand dropped to an average of ~41 units/period (P38-P40), a ~50% decrease from the post-back-to-school plateau (~82).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Denim SKU (621381001) has significantly cooled as we approach late November. The 'back-to-school' surge (averaging ~95 units in Aug/Sept) and the subsequent plateau (~80 units in Oct) have given way to a low-demand regime. Specifically, the last four periods (P38-P41) have seen demand figures of 46, 32, 45, and 25, averaging approximately 37 units per period. This shift is likely seasonal as we move past the autumn peak for standard denim trousers. With 181 units on-hand and 101 in-transit, current total inventory (282) is sufficient to cover over 7 periods of demand at the current rate (37 units/period), far exceeding the (L+1) requirement. To avoid excessive holding costs in this declining phase, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this cooling trend (approx 37 * 5 = 185 for mu_hat). No new orders are needed at this stage.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed for late November: Mean demand for P38-P41 dropped to ~37 units per period, down from the October average of ~80 (-54%). Current inventory levels are high relative to this new regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a seasonal cooling phase entering December. Demand has dropped significantly from the back-to-school peak (~95 units) and the post-peak plateau (~82 units) to a recent 5-period average of roughly 43 units (P38-P42). On-hand inventory is currently very high at 182 units, which is more than enough to cover the expected demand for the next 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods), assuming the current mean of ~43. With 182 on-hand and 33 in-transit, the system is overstocked relative to the current cooling demand regime. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the cooling period) to reflect the lower demand and allow the OR backend to minimize orders and reduce holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed for early December: Mean demand for P38-P42 is approximately 43 units/period, a significant reduction from the autumn peaks. High on-hand inventory (182 units) suggests a period of zero ordering is likely required to burn off stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (December 9, 2019). The demand for the Denim TRS SKU has entered a significant seasonal cooling phase following the back-to-school and autumn plateaus. Over the last four periods (P40-P43), demand has averaged 39.5 units, compared to the previous plateau of ~80 units. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 186 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4.7 periods of demand at the current rate (39.5 units/period), effectively covering the lead time (L=4) plus the current period requirement. There are an additional 8 units in transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the proximity to the end of the simulation (Period 47), the objective is to deplete existing stock rather than accumulate more holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 samples (P38-P43) to capture this cooling trend (mean ~38 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: December cooling regime confirmed: Mean demand for P38-P43 has dropped to ~38 units/period, roughly 50% of the October levels. High on-hand inventory relative to remaining periods suggests a focus on stock depletion.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), with only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47). The demand for this skinny denim item has transitioned into a seasonal cooling phase. Recent demand (P41-P44) has averaged 35.25 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 166 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4.7 periods of demand at the current rate (166 / 35.25 \u2248 4.7). Given that there are only 3 periods of demand left to satisfy (Step 3: Demand Resolution for P45, P46, and P47), the current inventory already exceeds the total expected remaining demand. Any further ordering would only increase holding costs without contributing to sales, as the game ends at the conclusion of Period 47. Although 'In-transit' is low (3 units), it is irrelevant given the high on-hand stock and the time remaining. I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect the cooled demand state, but the primary mechanism for the OR backend will be the base stock calculation relative to the high on-hand inventory, which should result in zero additional units ordered.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019 (Period 46). The game ends in 2 periods (Period 47). We are in a clear seasonal cooling phase for the Denim SKU. Demand over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) has averaged 32 units/period (25, 67, 21, 28, 19), with the most recent three periods averaging only 22.7 units. We have high on-hand inventory (147 units) and 23 units in-transit (ordered in P44 and P45). With only 2 periods remaining, our total current inventory + in-transit (170 units) far exceeds any plausible demand for the remainder of the game (expected ~45-65 units total). Ordering more now would only increase holding costs for inventory that will not sell before the game concludes. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period cooling regime to reflect current low demand, while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The backend's capped policy will naturally result in a zero order given the high existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Late-December seasonal cooling confirmed: Mean demand for P41-P45 dropped to ~32 units/period, with the most recent three periods (P43-P45) averaging approx 23 units per period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019 (Period 47). This is the final period of the game. For the Denim TRS SKU, demand has significantly cooled during December, consistent with post-holiday/end-of-season trends, averaging approximately 19 units/period over the last three weeks (P44-P46). The on-hand inventory is currently 131 units, which is far more than enough to cover the demand for the final period and any potential tail demand, especially given the cost structure where Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0). Since any remaining inventory at the end of the game will incur a holding cost penalty, the primary objective is to avoid further additions to the pipeline. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent cooling trend (N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the December decline) while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4. Since on-hand (131) + in-transit (23) vastly exceeds the required base stock for the final period, the OR backend will correctly place an order of 0.
