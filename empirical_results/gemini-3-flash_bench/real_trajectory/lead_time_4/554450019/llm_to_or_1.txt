Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 554450019 (Julia Denim RW TRS). The initial on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Historical demand shows a significant spike on 2019-02-04 (109 units) compared to the prior average of ~36.5 units. This suggests a potential demand regime shift or seasonal peak as we enter mid-February. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using all available historical samples (5 weeks) gives a mean of 51 and a standard deviation of 32.7. Since the most recent data point is a significant outlier/shift, I will use a conservative average of all samples to start, but I must ensure we order enough to address the zero on-hand state. Promised L=4 is used as the baseline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The SKU is Julia Denim RW TRS, part of the 'Divided' collection (trousers/jeans). Demand history shows a significant jump: from an average of ~36.5 units in January to 109 units (Feb 4) and 112 units (Feb 11). This suggests a strong regime shift or early spring seasonality for this fashion item. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a demand of 112 in Period 1 resulting in lost sales. There is a 105-unit order in-transit (placed Period 1) with a promised lead time of 4. Given the sharp demand increase, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=2 to capture the new demand level (approx 110/week) rather than the lower January levels. Since there are only 5-6 total samples and a clear shift, focusing on the last 2 periods is most appropriate. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current volatility. L is set to default (4) as we have no evidence yet of lead-time drift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 2019: Weekly demand increased from ~37 to ~110 units (+200%).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450019' (superstretch denim skinny jeans) is experiencing a demand regime shift. Historical data before February averaged ~37 units/week, but the last three observations (Feb 4, Feb 11, Feb 18) are 109, 112, and 81, averaging 100.6 units. This shift likely aligns with the Spring retail season for denim. Promised lead time is 4 periods; orders from Period 1 and 2 are in-transit and not due until Period 5 and 6 respectively. Consequently, on-hand inventory remains 0, and we are losing sales. Since we are in the middle of a high-demand regime, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean (~101) and volatility. This ensures the base_stock calculation (which covers L+1 = 5 periods) is grounded in current demand (~505 units) rather than the lower historical average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Julia Denim RW TRS' entered a high-demand regime in February (avg ~110), but we are currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (usable in Period 6). Current demand has fluctuated (112, 81, 52), making the recent average approximately 82 units/week over the last 3 periods. However, the initial jump to 109-112 suggests a volatility that needs to be captured. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to reflect this new regime (Period 1-3 data) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed in this new phase. Lead time L is kept at 'default' (4) as we have not yet seen any arrivals to contradict the promise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU is 'Julia Denim RW TRS', a basic 'Divided Collection' skinny jean. Historical demand shows a clear regime shift: Jan demand averaged ~36.5 units, while Feb-Mar demand has averaged 86 units (112, 81, 52, 79), likely coinciding with the spring fashion cycle. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, meaning it will be visible in the next period's 'conclude' message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 480 units in-transit. To set OR parameters, I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L) to capture this new, higher demand regime accurately. Since we have not yet observed a full lead-cycle completion to confirm actual lead time, I will set L to 'default' (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use N=4 to cover the periods since the Feb 4th spike (109, 112, 81, 52, 79), which better reflects the current trend compared to the earlier Jan data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1: Late-winter/Early-spring demand (Feb-Mar) averaged ~86 units, up from Jan average of ~37 (+130%).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Julia Denim RW TRS' (super-skinny jeans), a core 'Divided' collection item. Since Feb 2019 (Period 1), demand has shifted from the initial Jan baseline (~37) to a higher regime averaging approximately 80 units (Samples: 112, 81, 52, 79, 75). This likely reflects a seasonal pickup in early spring fashion demand. We confirmed at Period 5 that the lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Currently, we have 30 units on hand and 391 in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Since the L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A base stock target using a recent mean of ~80 units suggests a target around 400 total units. With 391 in transit and 30 on hand (421 total pipeline), we are currently well-covered. For the OR parameters, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for demand to capture the stable post-January regime and set L to default (4).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Observed: P1 order arrived at Period 5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). We have successfully confirmed a lead time of 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to January, with the last 6 periods averaging approximately 79.5 units per week (112, 81, 52, 79, 75, 78). Although Feb 4 showed a spike of 109, the subsequent actual demand has settled between 52 and 112. Using recent_N=6 for demand captures this specific spring regime. The current pipeline (in-transit) is 334 units, covering roughly 4.2 weeks of demand at the current mean. With lead time L=4, we need to cover L+1=5 weeks of demand (approx 400 units). The OR backend's cap and base stock calculation will now benefit from using the stabilized demand period rather than the lower January figures. I will keep L at default (4) and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current post-January trend.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable demand regime (P1-P6): Mean ~80 units/week, transitioning from Jan low of ~37.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product Julia Denim RW TRS, a staple 'super-skinny denim', shows consistent demand. We are currently in a transition period from late winter to early spring. Demand over the last 7 periods has stabilized around a mean of 80.8 units (112, 81, 52, 79, 75, 78, 89). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Period 5 (P1 order), Period 6 (P2 order), and Period 7 (P3 order). We currently have 106 units on-hand and 274 in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). The total pipeline plus on-hand (380 units) is well-aligned with covering the (L+1) window of 5 weeks at the current average demand of ~81 units/week (405 units total). I will continue using the recent_N method with N=7 to capture the demand shift that occurred after the initial low-demand January samples, effectively ignoring the pre-February data. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now proven.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/08. Demand for the Julia Denim RW TRS has been steady in the recent spring period, with a mean of 80.4 units over the last 8 periods (P1-P8). The most recent demand (P8) was 110, which matches the pre-game sample from 2019-02-04. Lead time is stable at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, and P4. Pipeline inventory is 232 (orders from P5: 16, P6: 57, P7: 69, P8: 90), which are scheduled to arrive in P9, P10, P11, and P12 respectively. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the 'Divided' collection's spring demand profile while ignoring the lower pre-February samples. For L, I use calculate as the observed lead times are consistently 4.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450019' (Julia Denim RW TRS) is currently in a stable demand regime. Since early February (Period 1), demand has averaged approximately 83.1 units per week (min 52, max 112). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every delivery since Period 5 (orders from P1-P5 have all arrived on schedule with L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 72 units with 333 units in transit. Using L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the stability since Period 1, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the mean (~83) and variance of the current regime. This ensures the OR policy targets a service level dictated by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a staple denim item (Julia Denim RW TRS). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5-10). Demand has stabilized since the initial February jump. Analysis of the last 10 periods (P1-P10) shows an average demand of 81.9 units per week. The most recent 5 weeks (P6-P10) show a slight moderation with an average of 82 units and a standard deviation of approximately 19 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 68 units with 356 units in-transit. The OR backend needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full established regime since the February shift, providing a stable mean (mu_hat) and capturing the observed volatility (sigma_hat) to maintain service levels while preventing over-ordering as we move deeper into the spring season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P1-P10): Mean confirmed at ~82 units/week with standard deviation ~19. Minimum demand observed 52, maximum 112.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand from Period 1 to 11 (Feb-Apr) shows a stabilized regime with a mean of approximately 78 units and a standard deviation of 19.3. The latest demand in Period 11 (49 units) is the lowest in the current regime but remains within the expected range of volatility. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (338) plus on-hand (88) is 426 units, which covers more than 5 periods of demand at the current average. Given the transition into late spring/early summer for 5-pocket denim jeans, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease as weather warms. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=11 to capture the full current regime and provide a stable forecast for the OR backend, ensuring a high service level while managing inventory levels as lead-time consistency is high.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a staple item (5-pocket superstretch jeans). Looking at the demand history since Period 1 (February), the mean demand has been approximately 76 units. However, the last two periods (P11 and P12) show a significant softening in demand (49 and 47 units respectively), compared to the prior average of ~82. This suggests a potential post-Easter/spring slowdown or a shift in regime as we head into May. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains perfectly reliable, with orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8 arriving exactly on time. On-hand inventory is healthy at 131, and the pipeline (288 units) is robust. Given the recent downtrend in demand, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current softening (mean of last 5 is ~58 units) while keeping sigma_hat on a broader window to account for the inherent volatility seen in earlier high-demand periods (e.g., 110-112 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected starting Period 11 (Late April/Early May): Mean demand shifted from ~82 to ~48 units (-40%) over the last two weeks.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. We are observing a significant demand deceleration for 'Julia Denim' jeans as we move further into the warmer spring/summer season. Demand in the last three periods (P11-P13) has been 49, 47, and 60 units (mean ~52), compared to the prior ten-period average of ~82 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline is currently very high at 171 units (orders from P10-P12), which is more than enough to cover the next 4 periods of demand at the current decelerated rate. On-hand inventory is also high at 188 units. To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the lower demand regime (~52 units/week). L remains at the promised 4 periods, which has been consistently observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed (May shift): Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P11-P13) dropped to ~52 units/week, down from the previous ~82 units/week average (-36%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $672.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 15 (May 20, 2019). Analyzing the history, there is a clear demand deceleration that began around Period 11. Specifically, the mean demand for Periods 1-10 was approximately 81.9 units, whereas the mean demand for the last four periods (Periods 11-14) has dropped significantly to 50.75 units (49, 47, 60, 47). This represents a decrease of roughly 38%. This shift is likely seasonal as 'Divided Collection' denim demand cools off entering late spring/early summer. In-transit inventory includes orders from P11 (51 units) and P12 (40 units), totaling 91 units. Current on-hand inventory is high at 221 units due to the recent demand drop and arrivals from earlier higher-volume orders. To prevent overstocking and high holding costs in this lower-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=4) to capture the current mean of ~51 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed for May period: Average demand has stabilized at ~51 units/week (P11-P14), down from ~82 units/week (+38% decrease).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. We have confirmed a demand deceleration starting around Period 11 (late April). The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) is 50.8 units/week, a significant decrease from the previous average of ~82 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 221 units on hand and 40 units in-transit (ordered P12, expected to arrive Period 16), our total pipeline is 261 units. Given the new demand regime of ~51 units/week, our stock is sufficient to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (5 * 51 = 255). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this lower May/June demand level and maintain sigma_hat based on the same period to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will likely calculate a base stock around 320-330 units, meaning no new order will be placed this period, which is appropriate given our high current inventory relative to the slowed demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. The demand for product 554450019 (superstretch skinny jeans) has clearly stabilized after the late April/May deceleration. For the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged 50.5 units/week with a significantly lower standard deviation (~4.8 units) compared to the spring peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (212 units) with 13 units in-transit (ordered P16, ETA P20). Our base stock target for (L+1) periods (5 weeks) at a mean of ~51 is ~255 units. With current on-hand + in-transit totaling 225, we are approaching a state where replenishment is needed. Using recent_N=6 captures the current low-demand summer regime accurately for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This avoids over-ordering based on the high demand seen in early spring while ensuring enough stock to meet the stable ~50 units/week requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~51 units/week (P11-P16) following the May deceleration. Standard deviation decreased from ~19 to ~5 in this period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450019' (superstretch washed denim jeans) has stabilized into a lower demand regime since early May (Period 11). The mean weekly demand for the last seven periods (P11-P17) is approximately 49 units (49, 47, 60, 47, 51, 49, 37). This is a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime of ~82 units. Current inventory is high (On-hand: 175), covering over 3.5 weeks of demand at the current rate. The shipment from Period 13 (ordered=0) correctly resulted in no arrival this period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on history. I will use the last 7 periods (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized lower demand and reduced volatility, ensuring the OR backend stops over-ordering relative to the current sales pace.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical data for SKU 554450019 (super-skinny denim jeans) shows a significant demand deceleration that began in late April/early May. Over the last 8 periods (P11-P18), the mean demand has dropped to approximately 46.5 units/week, with the most recent two weeks (P17-P18) showing a further decline to an average of 32.5 units. This suggests the post-spring peak has fully subsided as we move into summer. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on several observed arrivals (P5-P16), although naturally, no arrivals occurred in P17-P18 since no orders were placed in P13-P14. The pipeline inventory (93 units) plus current on-hand (147 units) is 240 units, which covers roughly 5-7 weeks of demand at the current rate. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 weeks (N=5) to capture this lower 'summer' regime (current mean ~42), ensuring the OR backend adjusts the base stock down to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for June: Mean demand decreased to ~33 units/week (P17-P18), continuing the downward trend from the May average of ~51.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Julia Denim RW TRS' (skinny jeans), which is currently in a sustained downward demand trend entering late June. Demand has declined from a peak of ~80 units (Spring) to ~51 units (May) and now to ~33 units (June). Specifically, the last three periods (P17-P19) show demand of 37, 28, and 34, confirming this lower regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on archival history (though no arrivals occurred in P17-P19 due to zero orders in P13-P15). There is currently 113 units on-hand and 101 units in-transit (from orders in P16-P19, which should start arriving in P20). Given the sharp decline in demand, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the June average of approximately 33 units/week. This avoids holding excess stock as we move further into the summer season, where denim demand often cools further.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for June: Mean demand currently ~33 units/week (P17-P19), continuing the downward trend from May's ~51/week average.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 21 (2019/7/1). Demand for the SKU (Julia Denim Trousers) has shifted downward significantly through June. Recent demand samples (P17-P20) are 37, 28, 34, and 15, yielding a mean of ~28.5 units/week. This represents a further deceleration from the May average (~51). The on-hand inventory is 111 units, and there are 88 units in-transit (orders from P17-P20), totaling a pipeline of 199 units. Since the current demand forecast for the (L+1=5) coverage period is roughly 142.5 (5 * 28.5) and our pipeline exceeds this, the OR engine will likely result in a zero order. However, we must provide accurate parameters for the backend. I detect a stable regime shift for June/July so N=4 is used for mu_hat. For L, observed lead times remain consistent at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for July: Mean demand dropped to ~28.5 units/week (P17-P20), showing further seasonal decline for the Denim SKU compared to May (~51) and April (~82).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product (superstretch denim jeans) is in a seasonal low, with a confirmed demand deceleration that began in April/May and has stabilized at a lower level in June and July. Recent demand for the last five periods (P17-P21) has been 37, 28, 34, 15, and 25 units, averaging approximately 27.8 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P16 and P17 orders arriving precisely on schedule in P20 and P21). The on-hand inventory is 132 units and the in-transit amount is 42 units (orders from P18 and P19). Given the low demand and high on-hand stock, the goal is to prevent overstocking during this slow summer season. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current late-June/early-July demand regime, which is significantly lower than the historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for July: Mean demand for the denim SKU has settled at ~28 units/week (P17-P21), representing the seasonal summer trough compared to the spring peak (~82 units/week).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for the Julia Denim SKU has stabilized at a seasonal trough. Over the last 6 periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged 25.7 units per week, significantly lower than the spring peak of ~82 and the May average of ~51. The most recent three periods (P20-P22) have been even lower, averaging 18.3 units. With on-hand inventory at 151 units and lead time confirmed at 4 periods, we are currently holding approximately 6-8 weeks of stock at the current demand rate. The OR backend's base-stock target (L+1 periods) will likely be around 100-130 units, meaning no new orders will be triggered given current on-hand levels. I will use recent_N=6 to reflect this lower summer demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for July: Mean demand for the denim SKU has settled at ~26 units/week (P17-P22), confirming the seasonal trough period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia Denim RW TRS' is currently in its seasonal summer trough (late July). Looking at the recent demand for the last seven periods (P17-P23), demand has consistently trended downward: 37, 28, 34, 15, 25, 15, 10. The average demand over the last four weeks is only ~16.25 units/week, significantly lower than the June average of ~33. On-hand inventory is very high (149 units) relative to current demand, covering over 9 weeks of supply at current rates. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we are well-overstocked. I will use a recent_N calculation for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this low-demand July regime and prevent the OR backend from ordering more units while we burn through existing stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for July: Mean demand for the denim SKU has decreased further to ~16 units/week (P20-P23), marking the peak of the summer seasonal trough.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Julia Denim) is currently in a seasonal summer trough. Demand has significantly decreased from its spring peak (~82 units/week) to an average of ~16 units/week over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). On-hand inventory is currently 139 units, which covers over 8 weeks of demand at the current rate (16 units/week \xd7 8 = 128). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target inventory window is (L+1) = 5 periods. Current inventory is already significantly higher than any reasonable base stock calculation for the current demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (P20-P24) to capture the current trough accurately for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This should result in an order of 0, allowing the system to naturally bleed down the excess on-hand stock and minimize holding costs while demand is low.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at seasonal trough: Mean demand for P20-P24 is ~15 units/week (Range: 10-25), a 50% decrease from the June average of ~30.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Demand for Julia Denim skinny jeans has reached a seasonal trough, averaging approximately 12 units per week over the last three weeks (P23-P25). This represents a significant decline from the spring peak (~82/week) and early summer levels (~30/week). On-hand inventory is high at 128 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents nearly 10 weeks of stock. Pipeline inventory is minimal (7 units), but given the low demand, the system is significantly overstocked relative to the target service level. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. For this period, I will use a restricted look-back window (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this deep seasonal trough and prevent the OR backend from ordering unnecessary stock while we bleed off the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough confirmed for late July/early August: Mean demand for P23-P25 is approximately 12 units per week, marking the lowest point in the seasonal cycle thus far.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Julia Denim) is currently in a seasonal demand trough in mid-August. Demand has stabilized over the last 4 periods (P23-P26) with an average of 10.75 units/week. On-hand inventory is 116 units, which is significantly higher than the required base stock for this demand level (~54 units for a 4-period lead time). The OR backend will naturally zero out new orders because pipeline inventory (116 on-hand + 7 in-transit) far exceeds the base stock calculation based on recent demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect this trough regime (P20-P26 avg \u2248 14 units), while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia Denim RW TRS' is currently in a seasonal demand trough as of August 2019. Historical demand has fallen from a spring peak of ~82 units/week to a recent stable average of approximately 14 units/week (P23-P27: 10, 10, 11, 12, 20). Period 27 showed a slight uptick to 20 units, but it is insufficient to signal a full regime shift yet. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. With 100 units on-hand and 3 units in-transit against a total lead-time demand (L+1=5 periods) forecast of approximately 70-80 units, the inventory is more than sufficient. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current trough while acknowledging the slight uptick in the most recent period to prevent stockouts if the 'Back to School' season begins to ramp up demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough confirmed for August: Mean demand for P23-P27 is approximately 13 units/week. Recent Period 27 (Aug 12) shows a slight uptick to 20 units, possibly signaling the start of a late-summer recovery.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/26, following a period where demand was 23 units (up from the 10-15 unit trough of July). History shows a clear seasonal pattern for Julia Denim jeans: a spring peak (Feb-Apr ~82/week), a summer deceleration (May-June), and a deep trough in July/early Aug (~13/week). The last two weeks (P27: 20 units, P28: 23 units) indicate the start of the 'Back to School' or late-summer recovery. I expect demand to continue trending upward as we move into September. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 80 units, and there are currently no units in transit. With an expected demand increase, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P26-P28 avg: 18.33) which captures the upward turn, and use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility during a regime shift (from s.d. ~1 to recent variation). This ensures the base stock calculation starts reacting to the recovery while the existing inventory covers the next few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer recovery detected: Demand increased from a trough of ~13 units/week (P23-P26) to ~21.5 units/week (P27-P28) as of late August.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. The product is a 'superstretch washed denim' trouser, which is likely entering a late-summer/early-autumn recovery phase as temperatures cool. We have observed a demand trough in July/August (~13 units/week) with a recent uptick in late August (P27-P29: 20, 23, 21 units). This marks a transition from the trough to a potential autumn recovery. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent recovery window (averaging ~21.3) while ignoring the deeper July lows. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent completed cycles. On-hand inventory (59) plus in-transit (30) is currently 89, which covers approx 4 periods of the current demand rate (~22), but additional buffer is needed as we head into September.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/Early-autumn recovery confirmed: Demand shifted from ~13 units (P23-P26) to ~21 units (P27-P29) as of September 2nd.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a late-summer/early-autumn recovery phase as of September. Demand has increased from a trough of ~13 units (P23-P26) to a mean of ~25 units over the last 4 periods (P27-P30: 20, 23, 21, 31). The most recent observation (31 units) suggests a continued upward trend typical for denim as the weather cools. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this recovery while remaining cautious of the full spring peak (~82). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (orders from P23 and P24 arrived at P27 and P28). With 28 units on-hand and 54 in-transit (orders from P29 and P30), the pipeline is starting to rebuild to meet this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: September recovery trend: Mean demand increased to ~25 units/week (P27-P30) from the August trough of ~13 units/week (+92%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, a massive demand spike occurred (177 units), which is significantly higher than the previous September recovery trend of ~25 units/week. This suggests a major seasonal event (e.g., Back-to-School peak or autumn fashion launch). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 86 units in transit (ordered in P29, P30, P31). Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the P29 order (30 units) is expected to arrive in Period 33, meaning P32 will likely face a stockout if demand remains high. Given this 'super-spike', I am shifting focus to recent demand dynamics. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the jump from ~20 to 177, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the dramatically increased volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation responds to the stockout risk and the increased demand level while the OR backend's safety stock logic handles the high variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Significant demand spike detected in mid-September (P31: 177 units), far exceeding the previous recovery trend of ~25 units. This indicates a potential seasonal peak for denim.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand phase following a significant spike in mid-September. Period 31 saw demand of 177 units and Period 32 saw 97 units, far exceeding the preceding recovery average of ~25 units. This suggests a seasonal peak for denim (back-to-school or autumn fashion). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 254 units in-transit. The order from Period 29 (30 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 33, but this will not be enough to satisfy current demand levels. To prevent stockouts and maximize profit during this peak, I am aggressively increasing the forecast. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the average of the last two peak periods (177 + 97) / 2 = 137 units per week. For (L+1) = 5 periods, mu_hat = 685. I'll use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (std of 177 and 97 is ~56.5), scaling for lead time: 56.5 * sqrt(5) \u2248 126. Lead time (L) remains 4 based on history.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal peak confirmed: Demand spiked to 177 units (P31) and 97 units (P32), establishing a high-demand regime compared to the August recovery of ~25 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450019 (Julia Denim) is experiencing a massive seasonal demand surge in September, consistent with 'Back to School' or Autumn collection transitions. Demand has escalated from a trough of ~13 units in August to a peak of 331 units in Period 33. Current on-hand inventory is 0, while pipeline inventory is 454 units (orders from P30-P33). We have missed significant sales (sold only 30 units against 331 demand in P33) due to stockouts. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the explosive growth (177 -> 97 -> 331), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect a high-sustained regime to ensure the OR backend generates a base stock level sufficient to cover the (L+1) = 5 period window. I will use the mean of the last 3 high-demand periods (177, 97, 331) which is ~202 units/period, making mu_hat = 5 * 202 = 1010. Sigma_hat is set relatively high (75 units per period * sqrt(5)) to protect against the high volatility observed during this spike.

Carry-over insight: September/Autumn seasonal peak confirmed: Demand spiked from ~25 units (late August) to a mean of ~202 units (P31-P33), a nearly 8x increase.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal peak for the Julia Denim SKUs, which began in September. Recent demand for Period 31-34 was 177, 97, 331, and 110 units respectively. The average demand for this 4-period window is 178.75 units. Despite the high demand, current on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts, as the pipeline (756 units) is still catching up with orders placed in Periods 31-34. The promised lead time is 4, and recent arrivals (P33, P34) confirm that actual lead time remains 4. To prevent further stockouts during this autumn peak, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime using recent_N (N=4) to capture the 178.75 units/week mean. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the significantly increased volatility (standard deviation ~104) during this spike. L is set to default as the lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: September/Autumn seasonal peak confirmed: Mean demand for P31-P34 is 178.75 units/week (Range: 97-331), with high volatility (std ~104). Pipeline is significant (756 units) but currently facing stockouts on-hand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained Autumn seasonal peak. Demand over the last five periods (P31-P35) has been 177, 97, 331, 110, and 102 units, resulting in an average of 163.4 units per week with high volatility. We are currently facing stockouts with 0 on-hand inventory, although a substantial pipeline of 1,080 units is in transit. Promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on recent arrivals (P33, P34, P35 conclude). To address the stockout and the high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=5 (covering the spike from P31) to capture the current mean of ~163.4. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this peak. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak confirmed (P31-P35): Mean demand increased to ~163 units/week from the August recovery of ~25 units. High volatility (std ~95) observed during this peak period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450019' (Denim Trousers) has shifted from a massive September/October peak into a late-October cooling phase. Demand peaked at 331 units in Period 33 but has dropped significantly in recent periods: 110, 102, and now 52 units in Period 36. We are currently in the Autumn season, which typically supports higher baseline demand than summer but lower than the initial back-to-school/Autumn launch spike. On-hand inventory recovered to 116 units this period after a series of stockouts, and the pipeline is extremely heavy with 1014 units in transit (orders from P33 onwards are starting to arrive). Given the sharp deceleration in demand from ~178 (P31-P34) to 52 (P36), I am setting mu_hat using a recent window (N=3) to catch the downward trend quickly and avoid over-ordering into a massive surplus, as the existing pipeline already covers several months of current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed post-October peak: Demand dropped from an average of ~178 (P31-P34) to 52 in Period 36. Significant pipeline inventory (1000+ units) is now catching up to the late-autumn deceleration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $774.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October/early November (Period 38). Demand has significantly decelerated from the massive September/October peak (~178 units/week) to a much lower level. For the last two periods (P36-P37), demand was 52 and 56 units respectively. On-hand inventory is now 290 units, and there is a massive pipeline of 784 units (ordered during the peak). Total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 1074 units. With current demand around 55 units/week, this covers roughly 19 weeks of supply, far exceeding the 5-week (L+1) requirement. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (demand mean) and sigma_hat (volatility) to reflect the recent post-peak stabilization around ~70 units (P35-P37: 102, 52, 56). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using this recent window will allow the OR backend to calculate a lower base stock, effectively stopping new orders (since the pipeline is already oversized) to avoid excessive holding costs as we head into the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak stabilization: Demand shifted from ~178 units (P31-P34) to a lower stable regime of ~70 units/week (P35-P37). Excessive pipeline inventory (780+ units) detected relative to current demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia Denim RW TRS' (5-pocket jeans) is entering November (Period 39). Historical data shows a massive autumn peak in September/October (P31-P35) which has now clearly decelerated. The mean demand for the last four periods (P35-P38) has settled at 75 units/week, down from the peak mean of ~178. On-hand inventory is currently high (526 units) following the arrival of large orders placed during the peak. Additionally, there are 458 units in-transit (orders from P35 and P36). Total pipeline inventory is 984 units, which at the current demand rate of ~75 units/week, covers over 13 weeks of supply. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent post-peak regime (N=4) to prevent further over-ordering while the system burns through existing stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak stabilization confirmed (P35-P38): Demand has normalized to a mean of ~75 units/week (Range: 52-102) after the Sep/Oct spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high inventory state (on-hand: 833) following the arrival of large orders placed during the September/October demand peak. Current demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level (mean ~75 units/week) post-peak. Specifically, demand in the last five periods (P35-P39) was 102, 52, 56, 90, and 49 respectively. With 833 units on hand and a mean demand of ~75, we have approximately 11 weeks of supply, which far exceeds the lead time + review period requirements. To minimize holding costs while demand remains in this lower seasonal regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 5-period behavior (N=5). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. No new orders should be triggered by the OR backend given the current inventory surplus.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has transitioned from a volatile September/October peak (averaging ~178 units) to a significantly lower and more stable late-autumn regime. Over the last five periods (P36-P40), demand has averaged 58.2 units (52, 56, 90, 49, 44). The massive pipeline from earlier aggressive ordering has now arrived, leaving us with 891 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the current average demand of ~58 units and a lead time of 4, the expected demand over the risk horizon (L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 290 units. Our 891 units on-hand are more than triple the required base stock. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 samples to reflect the stabilized post-peak demand. This will result in an order of 0, allowing on-hand inventory to deplete and minimizing further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-autumn peak (P36-P40): Mean demand has decreased to ~58 units/week with significantly lower volatility compared to the Sep/Oct spike.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450019 (Julia Denim) is currently in a stabilized post-autumn peak regime. Demand over the last 6 periods (P36-P41) has been significantly lower than the September/October spike, averaging approximately 54 units per week (52, 56, 90, 49, 44, 35) with a downward trend. Current on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 856 units due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (P33-P36). With zero units in-transit and a promised lead time of 4 periods, the current stock covers approximately 15 weeks of demand at the recent average rate. Given the game ends at Period 47 (6 periods away), there is no need to place additional orders. The goal is to maximize profit and minimize holding costs on the existing excess inventory. Parameters are adjusted to reflect the lower demand mean (~54) and reduced volatility observed since the peak ended.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stabilized post-autumn demand regime. For the last five periods (P38-P42), demand has averaged 61.8 units/week (90, 49, 44, 35, 91), which is significantly lower than the September/October seasonal peak. In Period 42, there was a slight uptick to 91 units, but it remains well within the stabilized range compared to the triple-digit peaks seen previously. On-hand inventory is very high at 765 units with zero units in transit. Given the current average demand of ~62 units and a lead time of 4 periods, the current stock covers approximately 12 periods of demand (765 / 62), far exceeding the required base stock level for a 5-period window (L+1). Consequently, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7 to capture the post-peak stability since P36) to ensure the OR backend accurately reflects this lower demand regime, preventing unnecessary replenishment while the excess inventory is depleted.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of extreme overstock following a massive autumn peak (Sep/Oct) where pipeline orders (over 1,000 units) were placed to meet demand that spiked to ~178 units/week. Since Period 36, demand has stabilized to a much lower post-peak regime of approximately 48 units/week (P36-P43 average). With 743 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit, the current inventory covers over 15 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given that there are only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (ending at Period 47), no further orders are required. The focus is to minimize holding costs while the existing stock is sold off. Parameters are set to reflect the current stabilized demand of ~48 units/week to ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary orders against the remaining horizon.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand regime (P36-P43) stabilized at ~48 units/week (Range: 22-91), marking a clear seasonal deceleration from the Sep/Oct peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in a post-autumn seasonal decline. Demand has significantly decreased from the September/October peak (~178 units/week) to a much lower level. Specifically, the last two periods (P43 and P44) have shown very low demand (22 and 14 units respectively). With an on-hand inventory of 729 units and zero in-transit shipments, the stock level is extremely high (roughly 15-20 weeks of supply at current rates). The game ends in 3 periods (Period 47). No further orders should be placed to minimize holding costs, as current inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Parameters are set to reflect the recent stabilized low demand regime while suppressing further procurement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for December: Mean demand has dropped to ~18 units/week (P43-P44) from the November average of ~48, indicating the end-of-year seasonal low.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. We are in the final periods of the game (Period 46 out of 47). The demand history shows a very clear seasonal cycle for this denim SKU: a spring peak (~82 units/week), a summer trough (~13-15 units/week), an autumn spike (~180 units/week), and now a December seasonal low. For the last three periods (P43-P45), demand has been 22, 14, and 16 units, averaging approximately 17.3 units per week. The on-hand inventory is currently very high at 713 units due to the massive pipeline orders from the autumn spike arriving just as demand crashed in November/December. With only two periods left (P46 and P47) and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends. More importantly, the current on-hand stock (713 units) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining periods (estimated at <40 units total). My goal is to minimize holding costs while the game concludes. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (~18 units/week) using the last 3 samples, and maintain default settings for lead time and sigma, knowing the OR backend's capped policy will result in zero orders due to the high inventory levels.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The item is in a seasonal low (December trough), with demand for the last five periods (P42-P46) averaging ~32 units, but the most recent four periods (P43-P46) are even lower, averaging ~17.75 units. Meanwhile, on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 694 units following the over-ordering during the September/October peak. Since the holding cost is $1.0/unit and current demand is low, the priority is to liquidate existing inventory rather than ordering more. No further orders are needed as the on-hand stock covers over 30 weeks of demand at the current rate (17.75 units/week). For the OR parameters, I will use a recent window (N=5) to reflect the low-demand regime, which will naturally result in a base stock level far below current on-hand inventory, triggering zero orders.

Carry-over insight: December seasonal trough stabilized: Mean demand for P43-P46 is ~18 units/week, down from the November average of ~48 units/week.
