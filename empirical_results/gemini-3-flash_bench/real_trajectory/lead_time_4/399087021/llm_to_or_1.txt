Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 399087021 (Ladies Super Skinny Denim). Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows a mean of 109 units (114, 94, 135, 102, 100) with a standard deviation of approximately 16.2. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit at the start, we need to establish a safety stock immediately to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). Given February is a standard retail month and the product is a staple item (Ladies Denim), I will use the available 5 historical samples to set the baseline forecast. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Ladies Denim Super Skinny Jeans'. Initial demand in Period 1 was 127 units, which is higher than the historical samples (avg ~109). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the order placed in Period 1 (136 units) hasn't arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have very few data points (5 historical + 1 period of history), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (all available samples) to set the demand mean and standard deviation. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the 127 demand spike in P1 ensures we don't stock out when inventory finally arrives. Lead time (L) remains 'default' as we haven't seen any arrivals to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Ladies Denim 5-pocket super-skinny jeans'. Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 109 units/period. Recent observed demand in P1 and P2 was 127 and 113, respectively, which is consistent with the pre-game samples. Since we have no on-hand inventory and the promised lead time is 4 periods, we are currently experiencing lost sales (127 in P1, 113 in P2). The current in-transit inventory is 275 units (136 ordered in P1 + 139 ordered in P2). No arrivals have occurred yet, which is expected as the lead time is 4. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (5 historical samples + 2 game periods) to capture the stable demand regime. I will use 'default' for L since no arrivals have concluded to suggest a deviation from the promised lead time of 4.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is Ladies Denim (super-skinny jeans). Historical demand samples (before P1) were around 109 units/week. Since P1, observed demand has been 127, 113, and 77. The drop to 77 in Period 3 might be a fluke or a slight seasonal shift, but the baseline remains around 100-110. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (136 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5 (P1 + 4), meaning they will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 412 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Since no orders have reached the promised lead time yet, we maintain the default lead time. For demand, the last 3 periods show a slight downward trend (avg ~105), but including pre-game data, the mean is fairly stable. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent activity including pre-game samples, and default for sigma_hat.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a staple item (Super Skinny Ladies Denim). Historical demand samples show a mean of 109 units (114, 94, 135, 102, 100). During the game (Periods 1-4), demand has been 127, 113, 77, and 90, averaging 101.75. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because the first order placed in Period 1 (with a promised lead time of 4 periods) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. Therefore, we should see the first arrival in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Since we have no concluded arrivals yet, we cannot confirm if the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods. I will use 'default' for L (promised = 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (5 historical samples + 4 game samples) to capture the base demand level while covering the lead time + review period (1+4=5).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Super Skinny Low-Rise Jeans', a staple fashion item. History shows demand has softened since mid-February, dropping from ~120 units to ~70 units in the most recent periods (P3-P5). Average demand over all 5 periods is 94, but the last 3 periods average 76.6. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). We currently have 73 units on-hand and 428 in-transit (P2, P3, P4, and P5 orders). Since L=4, the base stock targets (L+1) periods of demand. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the recent lower demand trend (approx 77 units/period) to avoid excessive holding costs, as current in-transit inventory is already high relative to this demand level. Sigma_hat is set to default to maintain a standard safety buffer.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Ladies Denim Super Skinny Jeans'. Historically, demand was around 110 units (P-4 to P1), but in the last three periods (P4-P6), it has dropped to an average of 71.3 units (90, 63, 61). This suggests a recent downward demand shift as we move out of the early spring peak or adjust to a different sales regime. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. On-hand inventory is healthy at 151, and we have a significant pipeline (289 units) arriving over the next 3 periods. Given the lower recent demand, the pipeline + on-hand (440 units) is likely sufficient to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) of demand (approx 72 * 5 = 360). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the lower demand trend and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility, helping prevent over-ordering while maintaining adequate stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 4: mean decreased from ~110 to ~71 (-35%). Lead time confirmed as 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the inventory status for SKU 399087021 (Ladies Denim Trousers) shows a clear demand shift. Historical demand before Period 4 averaged ~110 units, but the most recent four periods (Periods 4-7) have seen a drop to an average of 67.75 units (90, 63, 61, 57). This downward trend suggests a post-peak seasonal shift or a change in consumer interest. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on arrivals from Periods 1, 2, and 3. We have 231 units on-hand and 152 in-transit (ordered in Period 4 and Period 5), totaling 383 units of pipeline inventory. Given the current demand mean of ~68, a pipeline of 383 units covers over 5 periods of demand, which is sufficient since (L+1) = 5. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this lower demand regime and ensure the OR engine does not over-order now that inventory levels are healthy.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th. We are seeing a 5-pocket super-skinny jean SKU. Since Period 4, demand has significantly dropped from a mean of ~110 to ~53.3 over the last 5 periods (90, 63, 61, 57, 17), with a very sharp drop to 17 in Period 8. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple arrivals. Our on-hand inventory is currently 349 units, which covers over 6 periods of even the higher pre-drop demand (or ~20 periods of recent demand), meaning we are overstocked. The OR backend needs to recognize this lower demand regime to avoid further over-ordering while holding costs accumulate. I will use recent_N (N=5) for the demand forecast to capture the lower post-Period 3 mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: mean dropped from ~110 to ~58 since Period 4 (reduction of ~47%). Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-326.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim) has experienced a significant and sustained demand drop. Historical demand averaged ~110 units until Period 4, but the last five periods (P5-P9) show values of 63, 61, 57, 17, and 8, with a dramatic plunge in the most recent two weeks. The mean for the last 5 periods is ~41, but the last 2 periods specifically suggest a near-collapse in demand. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P5. Current on-hand inventory is 358 units with no units in transit. Given the recent demand drop, this inventory level covers more than 8 periods of demand even at the 41-unit average, and exponentially more at the current 8-unit rate. Since the holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit, maintaining excessive inventory is costly. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 samples to capture the downward trend while reflecting the lower demand regime (~50 units/period) and L to default to avoid further ordering while the system works through the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime collapse: Demand dropped from ~60 to <20 units/period starting Period 8. Current inventory (358) is heavily overstocked relative to current demand trends.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a severe demand collapse, with demand dropping from ~110 units in Feb to ~14 units (avg) over the last three periods (P8-P10). Current on-hand inventory is 340 units, which represents approximately 24 periods of supply at the current consumption rate. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. My objective is to halt all ordering to minimize burgeoning holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) while the system burns through the excess stock. To ensure the backend OR logic (base_stock calculation) does not trigger new orders, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to reflect the current low-demand regime, and set L to 'calculate' based on demonstrated stability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 (Ladies Super Skinny Denim) has collapsed completely. Initial demand averaged ~108 (Periods -4 to 2), dropped to ~60 (Periods 3 to 7), and has now cratered to an average of ~12 units/period over the last 4 weeks (Periods 8-11). Current on-hand inventory is 334 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 25 periods. There is no in-transit inventory, and given the massive overstock, no new orders should be placed. I am setting L to default (4) and using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (approx. 12 units/week). The OR backend's capped policy will ensure zero ordering because on-hand inventory (334) vastly exceeds the base stock level calculated from a mean of 60 (5 * 12).

Carry-over insight: Demand collapse confirmed at Period 11: 4-week average is 12.25 units, down from early-game average of ~110 (-89%). Significant overstock (334 units) will persist for the foreseeable future.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Super Skinny Ladies Denim) is in a severe demand collapse phase. Since Period 8, demand has plummeted to an average of just 13 units per period (17, 8, 18, 6, 16), which is approximately an 88% decrease from the initial baseline (~110). Current on-hand inventory is 318 units with zero units in-transit. Given the latest mean demand (~13)/period and the promised lead time of 4 periods, we require a pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) of roughly (4+1)*13 = 65 units to cover the risk period. With 318 units on-hand, we are nearly 5x overstocked. To prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new low-demand regime. This keeps the base stock calculation well below our current inventory level, effectively halting procurement while we bleed off excess stock.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim Trousers) has experienced a severe demand collapse since Period 8. The most recent demand samples are 17, 8, 18, 6, 16, and 4, resulting in a mean of approximately 11.5 units per week over the last 6 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 314 units and zero in-transit, the current stock covers over 25 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the holding cost is $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0, the current overstock is extremely costly. To prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect this new low-demand regime (approx. 11.5 units/period). Even with the base stock calculation, the on-hand inventory (314) will far exceed the target base stock (approx. (1+4)*11.5 = 57.5), ensuring no new orders are placed while we bleed off the excess inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a severe demand collapse regime, with demand averaging only ~10 units/period over the last 7 periods (P8-P14), down from an initial ~110. The current on-hand inventory of 306 units is extremely high, covering over 30 weeks of demand at the current rate. No further orders are needed for the foreseeable future. I am setting L to the promised 4 periods (consistent with observed history). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to accurately reflect the current low-demand state and prevent the OR backend from calculating a base stock level that would trigger any new orders while the surplus is liquidated.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in collapse regime: average demand for P8-P14 is 11 units/period, compared to P1-P4 average of 102.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (399087021 - Ladies Denim) has entered a severe demand collapse phase since mid-April. Demand in the last 8 periods (P8-P15) has averaged 10.5 units per week, far below the initial seasonal peak of ~110. On-hand inventory is currently 299 units, which at the current burn rate represents over 28 weeks of supply. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods (L=4), the inventory target (base stock) should be based on (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Using the most recent 8 periods of data (N=8) to reflect the current low-demand regime, the expected demand for the 5-period window is roughly 52.5 units. With 299 units on hand and 0 in transit, the OR backend will correctly see a massive surplus and order 0. We set L to default (4), mu_hat to recent_N (N=8) to accurately capture the collapse, and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=8) to reflect current volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim Trousers) remains in a severe demand collapse regime that began around Period 8. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P8-P16) is approximately 10.2 units per period, which is a ~90% reduction from the early-game average (~102). On-hand inventory is currently 291 units with zero in-transit. Based on the current demand rate, the existing stock represents roughly 28 weeks of supply. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, the target service level is roughly 80%. However, the massive overstock makes the base stock calculation academic, as no orders will be triggered. I will continue to use the 'recent_N' method (N=9) to capture the collapsed demand mean and volatility for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, effectively setting the base stock level much lower than current inventory to prevent any unnecessary ordering until stock levels normalize.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim 5-pocket jeans) remains in a deep demand collapse that began around Period 8 (April). Since Period 10, demand has averaged only 9 units per period, while on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 286 units. With a current 'months of supply' exceeding 30 weeks and zero units in transit, the primary objective remains to avoid placing any new orders. The backend OR logic uses a base-stock policy; to ensure the final order quantity is 0, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime. This keeps the calculated base stock well below the current on-hand inventory levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU remains in a severe demand collapse regime that began around Period 8. Demand over the last 11 periods (P8-P18) has averaged approximately 8.2 units per period, a stark contrast to the initial weeks (P1-P4) which averaged ~102 units. Current on-hand inventory is 283 units, which at the current burn rate represents roughly 34 periods of supply. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a service cycle of L+1=5, the required base stock is approximately 41-50 units (5 * 8.2\u03bc, plus safety stock). Therefore, no new orders should be placed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to isolate the collapse regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for L as the lead time remains consistent when arrivals occur.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim) remains in a state of severe demand collapse. Since Period 8 (April), demand has hovered around single digits, with the last five periods (P15-P19) averaging only 5 units per period. The current date is late June 2019, and there is no evidence of a seasonal recovery for this specific denim SKU. With on-hand inventory at 281 units and demand at 2 units in the most recent period, the current stock covers over 100 periods of demand. This represents a significant overstock situation where holding costs ($1/unit) will heavily erode profits ($4/unit). My primary objective is to prevent any further ordering by setting the OR parameters to reflect the current low-demand reality. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full collapse regime (P8 onwards) which will result in a much lower base stock than the current on-hand level, effectively pausing all replenishment until inventory is naturally depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand collapse persists: Average demand from Period 8 to Period 19 is approx 8.5 units/period, compared to initial average of ~110. No signs of recovery in late June.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), the SKU 399087021 (ladies super-skinny denim) remains in a state of demand collapse that began around Period 8 (April). The average demand from Period 8 to Period 20 is approximately 7.5 units per period, with Period 20 recording 0 demand. The on-hand inventory is currently 281 units, which at the current burn rate represents over 37 weeks of supply. Since the goal is to maximize total reward R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory, and the holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit, the massive overstock is severely penalizing the reward. My objective is to prevent any new orders from being placed by the OR backend. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=13 (covering the start of the collapse in Period 8) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the low-demand regime, and keeping L at 'calculate' (4). This will result in a base_stock level far below the current inventory of 281, ensuring no new units are ordered until the stock is significantly depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand collapse persists through July 1st: Average demand for the last 13 periods (P8-P20) is 6.5 units/period. On-hand inventory is critically high (281 units) relative to current demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Ladies Denim jeans (SKU 399087021) remains in a deep collapse regime. Since Period 8, demand has rarely exceeded 10 units per week, with only a single unit sold in the most recent period (Period 21). Current date is July 8th, and there are no signs of seasonal recovery. At an average demand of approximately 5-6 units per week over the last 14 periods, the current on-hand inventory of 280 units represents over 45 weeks of supply. This massive surplus is incurring significant holding costs ($1/unit/period) relative to the profit ($4/unit). To prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=14 (covering the collapse period from P8-P21) to accurately reflect the low demand mean and variance. The inventory level is significantly higher than any calculated base stock, ensuring zero units are ordered. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4 periods, which is consistent with early-game observations.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 (super-skinny denim) remains in a state of total collapse. Since Period 19, demand has been near zero (2, 0, 1, 0). The 15-period average (P8-P22) is approximately 6.5 units per period, while the most recent 5-period average is below 1 unit. Current on-hand inventory is 280 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents over 40 periods of cover. The goal is to prevent any further ordering to minimize holding costs while the excess inventory slowly depletes. I will continue to use the 'recent_N' method with N=15 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime, ensuring the calculated base stock remains far below the current on-hand inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in extreme stagnation: Average demand over the last 15 periods (P8-P22) is ~6.5 units/period, with the last 4 weeks effectively zero.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 (super-skinny low-rise denim) remains in a state of extreme stagnation. Over the last 15 periods (since Period 8), average demand has been approximately 6.5 units per period, with the most recent 4 periods showing a total demand of only 2 units (average 0.5 per period). Currently, on-hand inventory is 279 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods and the current demand rate, the current inventory level covers demand for dozens of periods. No new orders are needed. I will continue to use a 'recent_N' approach with N=16 to capture the sustained low-demand regime starting from Period 8, which will result in a very low base stock calculation, ensuring the backend places zero orders as the system works through the substantial overstock.

Carry-over insight: Demand stagnation persists through late July: Average demand for the last 16 periods (P8-P23) is ~6.1 units/period, with negligible activity in the last month.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (399087021 - Ladies Denim Trousers) remains in a state of extreme demand stagnation. As of Period 25 (July 29, 2019), demand has been near zero for several weeks, with only 1 unit sold per week in the last few periods. Specifically, the average demand over the last 17 periods (P8-P24) is approximately 5.8 units, but the most recent 5-week average is significantly lower (~0.6 units/period). Given the massive overstock of 278 units on-hand and zero in-transit, the primary objective remains to prevent any further ordering while the system slowly depletes the existing inventory. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 17 (covering the entire low-demand regime since Period 8) to ensure the base stock calculation remains significantly lower than the current inventory level, thereby ensuring 'final order' remains at zero. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (399087021, Ladies Denim Trousers) continues to experience extreme demand stagnation as of Period 26. Historical demand from Period 8 to Period 25 shows an average of ~5.2 units/period, and specifically the last 6 weeks (P20-P25) have averaged only 0.67 units/period. The current on-hand inventory of 277 units is overwhelmingly sufficient to cover this demand for the remainder of the game, even if a moderate recovery occurs. The primary objective is to avoid any further orders which would only increase holding costs. I will set parameters to reflect the current collapsed demand regime (last 18 periods since the major shift) to ensure the base stock levels calculated by the OR backend remains far below current on-hand levels, resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand stagnation persists through July and early August: Average demand for the last 18 periods (P8-P25) is ~5.2 units/period, with the most recent 6 weeks averaging <1 unit/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the ladies' denim project (SKU 399087021) has shifted abruptly from extreme stagnation (averaging <1 unit for the previous 6 weeks) to 44 units in Period 26 (date: 2019/8/05). This sudden spike suggests a potential late-summer clearance event or a pre-fall back-to-school demand surge. However, the current on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 233 units, which is still equivalent to over 5 weeks of coverage even if demand sustains at this new level of 44 units. Given the inventory-to-demand ratio and the previous 18 periods of very low demand, the objective remains minimizing holding costs while monitoring if this spike represents a new sustained regime. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike without overreacting, as our on-hand stock is already more than sufficient to cover potential demand for the next few lead times (L=4).

Carry-over insight: Potential demand recovery/spike detected at Period 26: demand jumped to 44 units after 18 periods of averaging <6 units. Monitoring to confirm if this is a sustained regime shift or a one-time event.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim 5-pocket jeans) has experienced a significant demand resurgence in August, aligning with the end of the summer season and the start of the 'Back-to-School' shopping period. Demand jumped from effectively zero to 44 units (Period 26) and then 107 units (Period 27), returning to the levels observed at the start of the game (P1-P4 mean ~102). This marks a clear regime shift from the stagnation observed between May and July. On-hand inventory has rapidly depleted to 126 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and current demand of ~107 units, the safety coverage requirements (L+1 periods) now exceed current stock levels (Expected demand ~535+ units over next 5 periods vs 126 units on hand). I will shift parameters to reflect this recovery, using a recent_N of 2 for demand and explicit \u03c3\u0302 to account for the sudden volatility, ensuring the OR backend triggers a replenishment order to prevent an impending stockout.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand recovery starting Period 26 (August): demand returned to early-game levels (~100 units/period) after extreme stagnation (April-July), signaling a seasonal or back-to-school regime shift.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim 5-pocket jeans) has clearly exited its summer stagnation and entered a strong 'Back-to-School' / autumn recovery regime. Starting Period 26 (August 5th), demand jumped from <1 to 44, then stabilized at 107 and 104 in the last two periods. This aligns with the initial February/early-March demand levels (approx. 102 units/period). On-hand inventory has plummeted to 22 units, and while 109 units were ordered in Period 28, they won't arrive until Period 32 (given the confirmed 4-period lead time). With current demand levels at ~105 units/period and only 22 units on hand, there is a significant risk of stockouts over the next 3 weeks before the Period 28 order arrives. I will set the base stock parameters to reflect this high-demand regime using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the current recovery trend, effectively mirroring the early-game performance. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed as of Period 28 (late August): demand returned to ~100+ units/period, consistent with pre-summer sales levels, ending the stagnation regime (April-July).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim) has successfully transitioned from an extreme summer stagnation regime to a high-demand autumn/back-to-school regime. Demand over the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 44, 107, 104, and 71, clearly returning to the early-game average of ~100. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 253 units in-transit (ordered P28 and P29). With a lead time of 4 periods, the P28 order (109 units) is expected to arrive in P32 and the P29 order (144 units) in P33. This leaves a critical gap in P30 and P31 where demand will be lost. To manage the new regime, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture the recovered mean of ~81.5 per week (totaling 407.5 for L+1). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current volatility of the recovery. L is set to calculate as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed since Period 26 (August): recent 4-week average is ~82 units/period, mirroring pre-summer levels after the P8-P25 stagnation period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is back in a high-demand regime (August/September), with demand averaging approximately 82 units/period over the last 5 weeks (44, 107, 104, 71, 87). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 384 units in-transit. These in-transit units represent orders from Period 28 (109 units), Period 29 (144 units), and Period 30 (131 units). Following the lead time of 4 periods, the P28 order is expected to arrive during the current period (P31), but won't be visible until the P32 start. Consequently, the simulation may record lost sales for P31 since starting inventory was 0. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture this post-stagnation recovery (~82 units/period * (1+4) = 410). For sigma_hat, N=5 captures the recent volatility of this recovery. L is set to 'calculate' as historical lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (399087021, Ladies Denim Trousers) has shifted from a summer stagnation regime (April-July) to a robust recovery regime starting in August (Period 26). Demand over the last 6 periods has been 44, 107, 104, 71, 87, and 100, yielding a mean of ~85.5 units/period. The current 'On-hand' inventory is 0, and 'In-transit' is 462 units, consisting of orders from Periods 28, 29, 30, and 31. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, the order from Period 28 (109 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 32 and be visible at the start of Period 33. Until then, we are experiencing stockouts. I will use the recent recovery regime (N=6 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure we maintain sufficient stock to meet the restored demand levels while the pipeline refills. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as historical arrivals (P5-P9) consistently showed an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised value.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is back in its high-demand regime (August/September), with recent weekly demand samples of 107, 104, 71, 87, 100, and 73. After a long summer stagnation, inventory was depleted, but the first recovery order (placed Period 28) arrived in Period 32, confirming the lead time remains 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low (36), but there is a significant pipeline of 365 units (orders from P29-P32). The average demand of the last 6 periods (since the recovery) is approximately 90 units. Setting N=7 for mu_hat correctly captures this post-recovery regime (starting P26) while ignoring the summer stagnation. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this recent 7-period window to capture current volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistent 4-period arrival observed.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 has fully recovered from its summer stagnation (Periods 8-25) and is now firmly in a high-demand regime consistent with late August and September performance. The average demand since Period 26 is approximately 88 units/period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 66 units, with 282 units in transit (ordered in Periods 30-33). Specifically, the 131 units ordered in Period 30 are expected to arrive in Period 34 (this period), and the 78 units from Period 31 in Period 35. To maintain service levels for this high-demand phase while accounting for the inventory already in the pipeline, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the post-recovery mean and variance (Period 26 to 33). This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~90 units/week requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~90 units/period since Period 26 recovery (August/September). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 (ladies skinny denim) has stabilized in a 'post-recovery' regime following a summer-long stagnation. Since the recovery in early August (Period 26), demand has averaged approximately 89 units per period (P26-P34). The current date is October 7th, which typically sees steady demand for women's denim before any late-year holiday peaks. On-hand inventory is 124, and there are 278 units in transit (ordered in P31, P32, P33, and P34). The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P32, P33, and P34). I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture only the recovery regime (from P26 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the pre-P26 stagnation data would severely underestimate current needs. This setting translates to approximately 445 for mu_hat (5 periods * ~89), which allows the OR backend to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-recovery: average demand from P26 to P34 is 89.2 units/period, consistent with pre-summer levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies Super Skinny Denim) is currently in a stable autumn regime following a significant recovery in August. Since Period 26, the demand mean has stabilized around 89 units per period (P26-P35 average = 86.9). The last four weeks (P32-P35) show a mean of 81.5 and a standard deviation of 22.1. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all recent arrivals (P32-P35 arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). Current on-hand inventory is 136, with 270 units in transit (ordered in P32, P33, P34, P35). I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the post-recovery regime (approx. 87 units/period) and sigma_hat using the same window to provide sufficient safety stock for the ~20-25 unit volatility observed., while L remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 (Ladies Denim) has stabilized in a 'high' regime following the August recovery. From Period 26 to Period 36, the average weekly demand is 85.36 units, significantly higher than the summer stagnation but slightly lower than the very first few weeks of the year. The most recent 5 weeks (P32-P36) average 79.2 units, showing consistent sales as we move into late October. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 78 units on-hand and 314 units in-transit (covering orders from periods 33-36), we are well-positioned. Using recent_N=11 for mu_hat (since Period 26) captures this post-recovery regime effectively. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=11 to reflect the volatility of this active period rather than including the zero-demand summer months.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the ladies' skinny jeans (SKU 399087021) has stabilized after its August recovery. Over the last 12 periods (P26-P37), the average demand is 84.4 units per period. In the most recent four weeks (P34-P37), demand has slightly moderated to 67, 70, and 62 units, respectively. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the full post-recovery regime while smoothing out the minor weekly fluctuations observed in October. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages. Pipeline inventory is currently 315 units (orders from P34-P37), and on-hand is 77 units. The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) without over-ordering as we approach the end of the game year (Period 47).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-August recovery: average demand from P26 to P37 is 84.4 units/period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Super Skinny Low Waist Epic' denim trouser, which showed a strong recovery in August/September (P26-P30) and has since stabilized into a consistent late-autumn regime. Over the last 13 periods (P26-P38), demand has averaged 84.8 units. Focusing on the most recent settled period (P34-P38), demand averages 62.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 142 units on hand and 241 in transit (total pipeline = 383), and an estimated 5-period requirement (L+1) of approx. 315-400 units, the inventory position is healthy. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent late-autumn stabilization (approx. 63 units/period) rather than the higher August peaks, which prevents over-ordering as we move deeper into November.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further in October (P34-P38) to an average of ~63 units per period, down from the August/September recovery peak of ~100 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a strong seasonal pattern. After an extreme stagnation period (April-July), demand recovered in August/September (P26-P34) averaging ~90 units. However, we have entered a new regime in October/November (P35-P39) where demand has moderated to an average of 61.6 units (P35:66, P36:70, P37:62, P38:62, P39:48). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Current inventory levels are high: On-hand (164) + In-transit (171) = 335 units. Given the recent average of ~62 units, the total inventory covers over 5 periods of demand. To avoid excessive holding costs in this moderated regime, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) to capture the current mean of ~62. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this recent 5-period window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderating since mid-October: average demand decreased from ~90 to ~62 units/period (P35-P39).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18), the product is in a moderating demand regime. After the 'back-to-school' recovery peak in August/September (~100 units/period), demand has trended downward through October and early November. The last 5 periods (P36-P40) show a mean demand of (70+62+62+48+32)/5 = 54.8 units. The most recent demand (32) suggests a further seasonal cooling as we approach late November. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current inventory position is high: On-hand (188) + In-transit (115) = 303 units. With demand averaging ~55 and trending down, the pipeline already covers roughly 5.5 periods of demand. Given the 188 units on hand and 56 units just arrived (P40), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward moderation and prevent excessive holding costs, as the safety stock needs have decreased alongside the demand mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderating further into mid-November: 5-week average (P36-P40) is 54.8 units/period, with a clear downward trend (32 units in P40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087021 (ladies super-skinny denim) is exhibiting a clear downward trend as we move further into November. The 5-week average demand (P37-P41) is 48.6 units, but the most recent two weeks averaged only 35.5 units. With on-hand inventory at 211 units and 53 units in-transit (due next period from P38), we are significantly overstocked. Current total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 264 units, which covers over 7 weeks of demand at current rates, exceeding the (L+1=5) period target. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent 5-week mean to prevent further orders and allow inventory to bleed down as we approach the end of the game (Period 47). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderating significantly in late November: last 2 weeks (P40-P41) average 35.5 units, down from early-November average of ~60. Currently overstocked.

Daily Reward (R_t): $331.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand unexpectedly spiked to 119 units, contradicting the previous moderation trend (avg ~35-40). This is likely a 'Black Friday' or holiday-related surge for ladies' denim. Despite this spike, on-hand inventory remains high at 145 units, with 5 units arriving soon (ordered P42). Total pipeline stock is 150 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the timing (December 2nd) and the preceding moderation followed by a spike, I will set mu_hat to capture this volatility. I'll use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to average the recent low (32, 39) with the recent high (119) and the moderate periods before it, resulting in a balanced forecast of approx 67.4 units/period (337 for L+1). Sigma_hat will be set to 'explicit' to account for the high volatility observed in the last three weeks (32, 39, 119). L remains at the promised 4 periods as shipments are punctual.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 saw demand jump to 119 units (Black Friday week), disrupting the November moderation trend (~35-40 units).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), we are navigating the post-Black Friday period for ladies' super-skinny jeans. Period 42 saw a significant holiday spike (119 units), followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (24 units). This decline is expected as the immediate peak of holiday shopping for denim often cools before a potential secondary pre-Christmas or post-Christmas clearance surge. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 121 units with 139 units in-transit (orders from P42, P43). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0), and the fact that we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47), we must be cautious not to over-order. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with N=4 to capture the recent high-volatility window (32, 39, 119, 24), which averages roughly 53.5 units. This allows the backend to account for the holiday spike's impact on variance while acknowledging the higher average demand compared to the mid-November lull.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday spike (P42, 119 units) followed by immediate cooling (P43, 24 units); demand volatility remains high entering mid-December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late-game phase (Period 45 of 47) for a denim product. Current date is mid-December. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (P45) would arrive in Period 49, which is beyond the game's end (P47). The game will conclude before new orders arrive. Currently, there is 84 units on-hand and 230 units in-transit. The orders placed in periods 42 (5 units) and 43 (134 units) are expected to arrive in periods 46 and 47 respectively. Total inventory available to satisfy demand in the remaining three periods (P45, P46, P47) includes the current on-hand (84) plus the P42 arrival (5) and the P43 arrival (134), totaling 223 units. With current demand averaging ~40-60 units (excluding the Black Friday spike), we are significantly overstocked for the final weeks of the game. Additional ordering would only increase holding costs without contributing to sales. Therefore, I will set parameters to stop further ordering while maintaining a realistic demand forecast for the backend to calculate service levels for the remaining stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility high in December: Black Friday (P42) saw a spike to 119 units, followed by immediate regression to ~30 units. Year-end inventory levels (223 units expected arrivals + on-hand) are sufficient to cover remaining 3 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), approaching the end of the simulation at Period 47. Currently, we have 48 units on-hand and 241 units in-transit. The game ends after Period 47 resolution. Any order placed now (Period 46) with a lead time of 4 would arrive at Period 50, which is beyond the game's horizon. Furthermore, the 241 units in-transit (ordered in P42, P43, P44, P45) are scheduled to arrive in P46, P47, P48, and P49 respectively. Specifically, the order from P42 (5 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 46, and the order from P43 (134 units) is expected during Period 47. Our current on-hand (48) plus these impending arrivals are more than sufficient to cover the remaining demand for the next two periods (P46-P47), especially given the post-holiday average demand of ~35-40 units. Placing additional orders now would only increase holding costs for inventory that cannot be sold within the game's timeframe. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are triggered by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent demand trend while recognizing the overstock.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the transition from year-end to early January. Historical data from early 2019 (P1-P4) showed demand levels around 100-110 units per period. Currently, we are emerging from a volatile December which saw a Black Friday spike (119) followed by a cooling period (averaging ~30 units in P43-P46). However, looking at the same time last year (the 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt), demand in January was 114, 94, 135, and 102. This confirms a substantial seasonal 'January jump' back to ~110 units/period. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. We have 30 units on-hand and 236 in-transit (orders from P43, P44, P45 totaling 134+91+11 = 236). These arrivals will hit starting next period (P47 conclude/P48 start). To prepare for the January demand levels seen in the historical context (~110 units/period), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*110 = 550 and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen during the previous transition into high demand.

Carry-over insight: January seasonal demand increase confirmed: Historical baseline (P1-P4) and provided 2019 sequence show demand returning to ~110 units/period after December cooling.
