This is a basics/staple item with year-round demand. b) Demand Regime Analysis: Historical data from Jan-Feb 2019 shows demand between 231 and 302 units, averaging ~266 units/week. Demand appears relatively stable but slightly increasing in late Jan/early Feb. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is Period 1, no orders are in transit yet. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. Total coverage needed is for L+1 periods (5 periods of demand) to ensure availability when the first order arrives in Period 5. e) Final Order Logic: Target stock is ~270 units/week * 5 weeks = 1350 units. To account for slight variance and the risk of being out of stock for 4 periods, I will place an initial order of 1400 units to establish the pipeline and meet upcoming demand once it arrives.",

Period 1 demand (287) was lost due to zero stock. e) Pipeline check: Lead time (L=4) plus one period for the current decision means I need to cover demand for Periods 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Total periods to cover = 5. Estimated demand per period = 270. Total requirement = 5 * 270 = 1350. Since I already have 1400 in-transit, the pipeline is currently sufficient to cover the gap until the first shipment arrives. Stockouts will occur in Periods 2-4, but ordering now at L=4 would only arrive in Period 6, adding to the inventory once the Period 1 order has already stabilized the situation. No additional order is needed this period to avoid overstocking later.",

  "rationale": "a) Product is 'Women's Fine-knit trainer socks'. It's late February, transitioning into Spring. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averaged ~266, but Period 2 saw a significant spike to 548. This might be a post-Valentine's or pre-Spring seasonal shift. b) Demand Analysis: Historical samples (231, 255, 302, 272, 272) averaged 266. P1 demand was 287 (stable). P2 demand was 548 (+106% jump). I need to determine if 548 is an outlier or a new regime. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4. I ordered 1400 in P1. Per the timing rules, this should arrive in Period 1+4=5 and be visible in P6. d) Inventory: On-hand is 0, and I have lost sales in P1 (287) and P2 (548) due to zero starting inventory. Pipeline is 1400. e) Strategy: With a lead time of 4, I need to cover demand for Periods 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. If the new demand regime is ~550, total pipeline needed = 5 periods * 550 = 2750 units. If the regime remains ~270, pipeline needed = 5 * 270 = 1350 units. Given the high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), being stockout-averse is better. However, 1400 units are already coming. I will order another 1000 to move toward a higher safety stock level without overcommitting until the P2 leap is confirmed or rejected in P3.",

This could be due to seasonal transition to 'trainer' socks for spring. Promised lead time is 4 periods.

Recent demand in P5 was lower (252), but historical data suggests high variability.

  "rationale": "a) World Knowledge & Product Description: The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks' for women. This is a staple item, but training socks often see increased demand in spring (March/April) as weather warms up and outdoor activities increase. b) Demand Regime Analysis: Demand has been fluctuating but shows a recent upward trend: P6 (329), P7 (415). Excluding the outlier in P2 (548), the average since inventory arrived (P5-P7) is ~332. Including historical data from Jan/Feb (avg ~265-280), the current demand is significantly higher. I'll estimate demand for the next 4-5 periods at ~375 per period to account for seasonal spring growth. c) Lead Time: Confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5; P3 arrived P7). The order from P4 is expected in P8 (this period), and P5 in P9. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 1404. In-transit is 850 (confirmed P4: 450, P5: 400).

Our current pipeline (2254) exceeds this by 379 units. However, to maintain safety stock and account for the P2 spike (548) or potential lost orders, I will monitor.

  "rationale": "The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks in a soft cotton blend,' a year-round staple with seasonal fluctuations. Analysis of the Oct/Nov window (Periods 35-40) shows demand has averaged approximately 263 units, which is lower than the ~350 expected earlier in autumn. This suggests a slight cooldown from the late September spike. In Period 41, on-hand inventory is 761 units. The pipeline contains 900 units: 350 (ordered P37, expected P41), 350 (ordered P38, expected P42), 200 (ordered P39, expected P43), and 0 (ordered P40, expected P44). Total inventory + pipeline equals 1661 units. Given (L+1) = 5 periods of demand coverage needed, and using a conservative forecast of ~280 units/period (total 1400 units), the current pipeline is sufficient to cover needs through Period 45. With 900 units still to arrive and ending inventory already climbing (holding 761 against a demand of ~260), I will place no order this period to avoid excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the game (Period 47).",

Since total inventory (1,451) exceeds the expected remaining demand (~1,200), there is a high risk of ending the game with excess inventory, incurring unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit).
