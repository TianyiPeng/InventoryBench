Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is women's trainer socks. The available historical demand (5 weeks: 231, 255, 302, 272, 272) shows a mean of 266.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 26. These samples represent early-year demand. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. There are no arrivals yet as it's the first period. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to achieve the optimal service level (q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95). I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR engine to use all 5 provided historical samples for the initial order while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). Examining the history provided: historical demand samples for SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks) show a stable pattern with a mean of approximately 270 units per week. In Period 1, observed demand was 287, but because starting on-hand was 0 and nothing arrived yet, 0 units were sold. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have an in-transit quantity of 310 units from Period 1 and L=4, we do not expect it to arrive until Period 5 (concluded message visible in Period 6). For our current decision, we use 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (using the four historical samples + Period 1 demand) to capture the base demand level and volatility while we wait for initial stock to arrive.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand for 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) has spiked significantly from a historical average of approx. 270 (Jan-Feb) to 548 in Period 2. This correlates with the transition into late February/Spring, where demand for trainer socks typically rises. Inventory is currently 0 with 617 units in-transit. Promised lead time is 4. No units have arrived yet, which is expected as the first order (P1) is not due until P5 (1 + 4 = 5). I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the trend while including the recent spike. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for increased volatility. L remains default.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is Women's Fine-knit trainer socks, a basic staple item. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In the first three periods, demand has been significantly higher than the initial historical samples (averaging 411 units/week vs. ~270 units/week). However, because the lead time is 4, no orders have arrived yet (on-hand is 0), leading to lost sales. The first order placed in Period 1 (310 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start observation). Total in-transit is 1150 units. Given the demand jump since the game started, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the higher realized demand of 287, 548, and 399. I will maintain the default lead time (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a drift.

Carry-over insight: Initial demand (avg 411) is ~50% higher than pre-game historical samples (avg 270).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is Women's Fine-knit trainer socks. Historical samples from Jan-Feb averaged 266 units/period, but actual demand in Periods 1-4 averaged 393 units/period (287, 548, 399, 338), representing a significant upward shift. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The Period 1 order (310 units) was placed in P1 and, with a 4-period lead time, is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. This arrival is not yet visible in the 'conclude' messages. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to significant lost sales. To stabilize, I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=4) to capture the higher observed mean (~393). For lead time, I will stick with the 'default' (promised L=4) as we haven't seen the first delivery yet to confirm any deviation. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, helping to recover from the stockout once shipments arrive.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a staple item. Initial demand observations (P1-P5) average 364.8 units/period, which is significantly higher than the pre-game context (270). However, recent periods (P4 & P5) show a downward trend (338 and 252 respectively). The first order (310 units from P1) arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods, confirming L=4 is currently reliable. I am currently holding 58 units on-hand with 2046 in-transit. The OR backend needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the volatility in the first 5 periods (Range 252-548), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher-than-historical game demand while accounting for the recent variance.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Reviewing inventory: On-hand is 36, and there is a large pipeline (1888 units) consisting of orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6. Specifically, the order from Period 3 (533 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of this period (Period 7), as the confirmed lead time from the 'conclude' messages for Periods 5 and 6 is exactly 4 periods. The demand for the last 6 periods averages 358.8, which is higher than the pre-game history (avg 266) but lower than the initial spike seen in the first few periods of gameplay (avg 411). I am using recent_N=6 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this stabilized 'new normal' demand level. For volatility (sigma_hat), I am also using recent_N=6. For lead time, I will stick with the promised 'default' since the actual arrivals from Periods 1 and 2 perfectly matched the 4-period promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 1-6 average is 359 units/period, significantly higher than pre-game history (~266) but lower than initial spike.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). Previous arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7) confirm a stable lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 154, with 1,612 units in the pipeline (orders from P4-P7). Historical demand since Period 1 has averaged 366 units (287, 548, 399, 338, 252, 329, 415), which is significantly higher and more volatile than the pre-game history (avg ~266). Given the SKU (Fine-knit trainer socks) and the spring date (April), we are entering a season where demand for 'trainer socks' typically increases as weather warms. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full game history demand regime (avg ~366) while ignoring the lower pre-game samples. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1)=5 period demand window (approx 1,830 units) against our current pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/08). Reviewing history, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as seen in Period 5-8 conclusions). Demand since the start of the game (Periods 1-8) has averaged 368.75 units per period, which is significantly higher than the pre-game context (avg ~266). While early periods showed some volatility, the last 4 periods have averaged 364.5, suggesting a stable high-demand regime. The product is trainer socks, which are entering peak seasonal demand as Spring progresses in April. On-hand plus pipeline (399 + 1415 = 1814) is healthy for a lead time of 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the duration of the game) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for L since it matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed higher than pre-game history: Period 1-8 average is 369 units vs pre-game average of 271 (+36% shift).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is standard women's cotton blend trainer socks. Historical lead times for the first 5 arrivals have been consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand regime shift noted in previous periods is sustained; mean demand since Period 1 is 363.5 units per period, compared to the pre-game average of ~271. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the higher in-game demand level for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as use of pre-game samples would understate requirements. On-hand plus pipeline (656 + 1202 = 1858) is healthy, covering approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate. Setting parameters to maintain this level while the OR backend manages the ordering cap.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks' has stabilized since the start of the game. Historical analysis shows a clear shift: the pre-game mean was ~271, while the average of the first 10 periods of the game is ~358 (+32%). The lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (confirmed by arrivals in periods 5 through 10). I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this significantly higher game-time demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it filters out the non-representative pre-game data while providing enough samples for stability. L is set to 'calculate' since the observed lead times have been consistent with the promised lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is basic trainer socks, which typically see steady or slightly increasing demand moving into late spring and summer. Reviewing the completed game history (Periods 1-11), demand has averaged 355 units per period, consistently higher than the pre-game samples (avg 271). In the last 5 periods (P7-P11), the average demand is 370.8 units, suggesting a stable high-demand regime is maintained. All orders from P1 to P7 have arrived with exactly 4 periods of lead time (L=4). For Period 12, I will use L = 4 (promised/observed). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the most recent stabilized demand level (approx 371 * 5 = 1855). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the recent volatility (std dev) around this mean, ensuring the OR engine correctly calculates the safety stock to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Period 13 (2019/5/6). Historical demand samples from Period 1 to 12 show an average of 370 units per period (std \u2248 84), which is significantly higher than the pre-game history average of 271. Lead times have been consistently verified at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P8). Current on-hand inventory is 319, with an in-transit pipeline of 1295 units (orders from P9, P10, P11, P12). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend will aim for a high service level (~95% critical ratio). Using 'recent_N' with N=12 for demand parameters will capture the stabilized game-time demand regime while excluding the irrelevant pre-game data. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (trainer socks) demonstrates a higher demand profile in-game than in pre-game history. The latest 13 periods show a mean of 362.5 units/period, compared to the pre-game average of ~266. Lead time has been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P9). Current on-hand inventory is 418 and pipeline inventory is 1433. For Period 14 (mid-May), there is no strong evidence of a seasonal shift yet, but demand has remained consistently elevated relative to the baseline. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture the full in-game trend while filtering out the pre-game bias. I will set L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent. sigma_hat will also be calculated based on the recent 13 periods to account for the current volatility (std dev is higher than pre-game).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees steady demand entering the summer months. Historical lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods (Periods 1-10 all arrived at L=4). Current on-hand inventory (422) combined with in-transit units (1420) is sufficient, provided demand remains stable. Over the last 6 periods, demand has averaged 336 units (ranging from 267 to 438), which is slightly lower than the early period spike but significantly higher than pre-game history. I will use a N=6 regime (covering Period 9-14) to capture the most recent demand behavior, setting L=4 as the confirmed lead time. This will allow the OR backend to maintain a safety stock targeted to the current 336 units/period average while accounting for the historical volatility (\u03c3) within this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6269.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens fine-knit trainer socks) shows a consistent demand regime since the start of the game, averaging approximately 356 units per period over the first 15 periods, which is significantly higher than the pre-game historical mean of ~271. Lead times have remained perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from periods 1-11). Current on-hand inventory is 343, and in-transit inventory is 1283, totaling 1626 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A consistent mean of ~356 units/period suggests a target base stock around 1780-1800 units. To allow the OR backend to react to the higher post-game demand, I will use recent_N with N=15 (covering all game data) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time method as it is highly stable.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd (Period 17). Historically, demand for trainer socks remains stable through the summer months. Over the last 16 periods, the mean demand is 354 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-game samples (~270). The most recent 5 periods (P12-P16) have an average demand of 340 units with moderate volatility. Lead time remains consistently at exactly 4 periods (P1-P12 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). There are no missing shipments, and the pipeline inventory (1349) plus on-hand (354) covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current average. I will use a window of the last 12 periods (P5-P16) to capture the stable demand regime while ignoring the initial high-volatility spikes from P1-P4. This will set a robust base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically see steady demand in spring/summer. Analyzing the 17 concluded periods, the average demand is 351 units, which is significantly higher and more volatile than the pre-game history (avg 271). However, the demand has been relatively stable around this higher mean for several months now (Periods 1-17). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met in every single order from Period 1 to Period 13 (arriving in Period 17). Inventory levels are currently healthy with 561 on-hand and 1097 in-transit. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable-but-higher-than-history regime, while keeping the lead time at its reliable default of 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (fine-knit trainer socks) is entering the peak summer period (mid-June), where demand for trainer socks typically remains stable or slightly elevated. Over the last 18 periods, the demand has stabilized at a new mean significantly higher than pre-game history. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P9-P18) is approximately 334.6 units. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (observed in every conclusion from P5 to P18). Current on-hand inventory is 533 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 1112 units. I will set L to 'calculate' as it has been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current stable demand regime (post-initial spike) during the summer season, which provides a reliable basis for the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Last 10 periods (P9-P18) average 335 units/period, confirming a sustained shift from pre-game 271 avg (+23%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is Women's fine-knit trainer socks, which typically see consistent demand during summer months. Analysis of the demand history shows a sustained regime shift: the average demand over the last 10 periods (P10-P19) is 335.8 units/period, compared to the pre-game average of 271. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5 through P19). For Period 20, I will use recent_N to capture this stabilized demand regime (N=10) and calculate for lead time. This approach ensures the base stock reflects current consumption patterns while accounting for the 4-period lead time pipeline, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Sock', which is a staple product likely to see consistent performance. Current Date is July 1st. Looking at demand history, the last 10 periods (P11-P20) show a mean demand of approximately 339.9 units per period with a standard deviation of 61.2. This is consistent with the 'Period 19' carry-over insight which noted a stabilization at around 335 units. The actual lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods (validated through P16 order arriving in P20). Inventory calculation: On-hand (489) + In-transit (1123) = 1612 units. This covers roughly 4.7 cycles of demand (1612 / 340). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this stable post-spike regime, and 'default' for lead time as the promised 4 periods is consistently being met.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees stable demand during summer months without significant seasonal spikes until late summer/back-to-school periods. Historical lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in all 'conclude' messages from Period 5 to Period 21). Demand from Period 19-21 has averaged 313 units, which is slightly lower than the P9-P18 average of 335 but significantly higher than the pre-game history (271). Since there have been no major regime shifts recently, I will use a recent_N window of 10 periods (covering P12-P21) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable state more accurately than the full game history. This balances the higher post-P1 demand with the more moderate levels seen in the last few weeks. L will remain at the promised default of 4 as the actual data perfectly matches it.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is women's trainer socks, which are staple items but generally see consistent demand through the summer months. Analysis of the last 10 periods (P13-P22) shows a very stable demand mean of 306.9 units per period (range 267-348), which is a slight softening from the earlier P1-P12 average but still significantly higher than the pre-game history (271). In-transit inventory matches the orders from P19, P20, P21, and P22 (250+340+284+227 = 1,101), confirming no lost shipments. The actual lead time remains consistently 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (P13-P22). This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the next (L+1)=5 periods of demand based on the most relevant recent performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P13-P22): Mean demand has adjusted to ~307 units/period, down from the earlier P1-P12 average of ~374, while remaining above pre-game history. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P24 (July 22, 2019). The SKU is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal item that typically sees steady demand in summer but can fluctuate based on retail cycles. Examining recent demand (P19-P23: 334, 289, 317, 313, 352), the mean is approximately 321 units/period. This confirms a relatively stable regime since the shift noted around P19. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (P23 arrival was ordered at P19, 23-19=4). On-hand inventory is 290, and in-transit is 1031. Total pipeline is 1321 units, which covers roughly 4.1 periods of current demand. Given a promised lead time of 4, our base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stable average (321) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to provide a robust volatility measure over the recent stable period. Lead time remains 'default' (4).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is now in late July, moving into early August. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods across all 24 periods. Demand has stabilized into a secondary regime following an initial post-February spike. Specifically, from Period 13 to Period 24 (the most recent 12 periods), the mean demand is 309.58 units per period, which is notably lower than the high-volatility Period 1-12 average (~374) but remains above the pre-game baseline (~270). The recent volatility (standard deviation of ~30) is significantly lower than the full history. Given the stability of both lead time and this demand regime, I will use a window of the last 12 samples (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current lower-volatility state while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers (4+1)=5 periods of demand at the current 310-unit average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P13-P24): Mean demand is ~310 units/period (down from P1-P12 avg of ~374), with significantly reduced volatility compared to initial periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Women's Fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a stable demand regime. Analyzing the last 13 periods (P13-P25), the mean demand is 303 units per period, which is significantly lower than the P1-P12 average (~374) but remains higher than the pre-game history (~271). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P25 (ordered P21). Current date is August 5th; we are in the late summer season for trainer socks. Given the stability of the current regime, I will use N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this newer, lower-volatility baseline (P13-P25). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 matches all historical observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4552.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 27 (2019-08-12). Historical lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated through Period 26 conclude message). Demand appears to have settled into a lower-volatility regime compared to the start of the simulation. For the last 14 periods (P13-P26), the mean demand is approximately 306 units per period, while the mean of the last 4 periods (P23-P26) is 285.75, showing a slight softening. Given this stability, I will use recent_N with N=14 to reflect the most stable recent demand regime (dating back to Period 13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the slightly higher long-term mean with the more recent dip, providing a conservative safety buffer for the backend's capped base-stock policy. Lead time remains 'default' as the promised 4 periods is perfectly stable.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P28 (mid-August). In-transit inventory includes orders from P24 (373), P25 (263), P26 (242), and P27 (244), totaling 1122 units, which is consistent with the lead time and recently placed orders. The confirmed lead time remains 4 periods based on the P23 order arriving at the conclusion of P27. Demand has shown a sustained lower mean since P13. Calculating the mean for the recent stable regime (P13-P27, 15 periods): the average demand is 303.8 units per period. This is a significant and sustained shift from the earlier P1-P12 average (~374). I will use recent_N with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and reduced volatility accurately. The lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P13-P27): Mean demand is ~304 units/period, confirming a sustained lower plateau compared to the initial P1-P12 period (~374).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a stable demand regime. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P13-P28), the mean demand has stabilized around 303 units per period with relatively low volatility compared to the initial 12 periods. The most recent demand samples (P24-P28: 277, 256, 258, 301, 294) average 277 units, suggesting a slight further softening or continued stability. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P24 order arrived in P28, confirming L=4). I will use recent_N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established 'lower plateau' regime (P13 onwards) which is more representative of current demand than the full history or the initial spike. L will be set to 'calculate' as it consistently matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Women's trainer socks has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 13. The average demand over the last 15 periods (P15-P29) is approximately 293 units, compared to the early game average of ~374. The most recent 5 periods show a slightly lower average of ~268 units, potentially indicating a seasonal shift as summer ends (Sept 2). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am using recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime while providing enough data points for statistical reliability. This ensures the OR backend targets a 95% service level based on the sustained demand level of the last few months rather than the initial high-demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P15-P29): Mean demand is ~293 units/period, showing a consistent reduction from the P1-P12 average (~374) and more volatility than pre-game history. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Nightwear Socks) is currently in a stable demand regime. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 15-30), the average weekly demand is approximately 293 units, which is lower than the initial Period 1-12 average (~374) but remains slightly above pre-game historical samples (~271). The lead time has been consistently observed at 4 periods across all arrivals to date. In-transit inventory is currently 1068 units, which covers approximately 3.6 periods of demand at the current rate. Given that we are entering September, we should monitor for any seasonal uptick in nightwear/socks, but currently, the mean and variance are stable. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture the current regime since Period 15. I will use 'calculate' for the lead time as it has been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product is basic cotton-blend trainer socks. Historically, demand for this SKU has stabilized into a lower-variability regime compared to the early game. Over the last 15 periods (P17-P31), the mean demand is approximately 290 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) show a slightly lower mean of 270 units, but given the seasonal nature of socks (trainer socks may see a slight dip heading into autumn), I will use N=10 to balance recent trends with stability. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across the entire game (31 observed completions, all with lead_time=4). Pipeline inventory (1087) + on-hand (300) = 1387. At a mean of ~285, this covers roughly 4.8 periods, which is aligned with the L+1 requirement (5 periods). I use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable regime (approx. Period 22 onwards).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P22-P31): Mean demand is ~284 units/period, showing a slight further decrease and lower volatility compared to the earlier P13-P21 period (~324).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is women's trainer socks, which generally see stable demand in early autumn. Analysis of recent demand indicates a sustained lower plateau; the average demand from Period 22 to Period 32 is approximately 276 units per period, which is lower than the initial game phases but still above the pre-game history. The lead time has remained exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods for all 28 completed orders. On-hand inventory is 347 units, and in-transit inventory is 940 units (representing orders from Periods 29-32). Given the stability of both demand and lead time, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand regime (approx. 275 units/period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. I'll maintain 'default' for lead time since the promised 4 periods is perfectly consistent with observations.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand in Period 33 spiked to 405, whereas the average from Period 22-32 was approximately 284. This spike coincides with late September (Period 33 date: 2019/9/23), which could indicate the beginning of a seasonal shift for 'Womens Nightwear, Socks & Tights' as the weather cools. However, since the Carry-over policy requires sustained evidence (3+ periods) for a new regime shift, I will treat this as high-volatility demand within the existing regime for now but remain responsive. The lead time remains extremely stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the recent 12 periods (P22-P33) to capture the slightly lower demand trend while accommodating the recent spike in the mean and volatility calculations. This corresponds to the most recent stabilized plateau mentioned in the carry-over insights, plus the most recent data point.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is entering October. Historically, demand for basic hosiery tends to remain stable or slightly increase towards colder months. Recent history (Period 22-34) shows a mean demand of approximately 283 units/period, despite a spike to 405 in Period 33. The last 13 periods provide a stable regime for calculating demand. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the entire history. Pipeline inventory is currently high (995 units), which is sufficient to cover the expected lead-time demand (approx 1415 units over 5 periods). I will use the most recent 13 periods (P22-P34) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized demand level while hedging against the recent volatility observed in Period 33.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. We are entering the fall/winter season for women's fine-knit trainer socks. Demand in the most recent periods (P33-P35) has shown some higher peaks (405, 312, 266) compared to the stable late-summer period (P32 avg ~284). The service level target is high (q=19/20 = 0.95), justifying a robust base stock. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since P32, we've seen slightly higher volatility and a minor uptick in mean demand. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime which reflects the current fall demand levels (approx 280-300 mean), moving away from the summer lows. This period's on-hand is low (156), so the OR backend will likely trigger a larger order to replenish toward the base_stock, which is appropriate given the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4496.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a staple item ('7p Basic Shaftless | Socks') and the current date is October 21. As we approach November and December, demand for basic hosiery and cold-weather essentials typically rises. Historical data over the last 15 periods (P21-P36) shows a mean demand of 281, but P33 recently spiked to 405, suggesting the beginning of a seasonal lift or increased volatility. The lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is critically low (64 units) relative to the current mean. To account for the likely seasonal upturn in late October/November and ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1), I will use the recent_N method with N=15 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime while acknowledging the recent uptick. This will keep the OR backend's service level calculation responsive to current trends without overreacting to a single spike, while the inherent high profit margin ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) will naturally push the backend toward a high safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Slight demand uptick observed starting P33 (P33-P36 avg: 305 vs P22-P32 avg: 275), potentially signaling the start of seasonal demand for socks/nightwear as winter approaches.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5263.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory has hit 0 as of the Period 37 conclude message due to a stockout (sold 277 out of 306 demanded). This was caused by the arrival of only 213 units (ordered P33) against a rising demand trend. Demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) has averaged 305.8 units, which is a significant increase from the previous 'stabilized' regime of ~284 (P22-P31). This confirms the seasonal uptick noted in previous carry-over insights as we approach November (winter seasonality for socks). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (P33-P37) to capture this higher demand regime and ensure the OR backend orders enough to recover from the stockout and meet the higher seasonal demand. L is set to default (4) as lead times have been perfectly stable.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand uptick confirmed: Period 33-37 average demand is 306 units, a ~8% increase from the P22-P32 average of 284. Inventory reached 0 in P37 due to this shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5149.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 39 (early November). Recent history (P33-P38) confirms a demand uptick to an average of ~301 units, compared to the previous plateau of ~284 (P22-P32). This align with seasonality for socks/nightwear as winter approaches. Period 37 saw a stockout due to a demand spike (306 units) and low starting inventory, but we recovered in Period 38 with a 371-unit arrival. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this higher seasonal demand regime (avg ~301) while remaining responsive to the current trend. For sigma_hat, I'm also using recent_N (N=6) because the volatility in this seasonal ramp-up (std ~59) is higher than the stable period. With a high service level logic (profit $19 vs holding $1), maintaining slightly higher inventory to prevent further stockouts during the winter ramp-up is optimal.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product (fine-knit trainer socks) is entering the winter season. Historical demand data from Period 33 onwards shows a sustained average of 292.4 units, which is higher than the previous low-plateau average of 284. Although there was a stockout in Period 37, recent arrivals (P38, P39) have stabilized on-hand inventory at 224. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend targets a high service level (~95%). I will use recent_N=7 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the seasonal uptick (P33-P39) and recent_N=10 for volatility (sigma_hat) to smooth out recent variations. L remains 'default' or 'calculate' given its stability.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand uptick for socks confirmed starting Period 33: Average demand (P33-P39) is 292 units, a ~3% increase over the P22-P32 average of 284, showing lower but consistent growth as winter approaches.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, approaching the peak winter season for 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. While Period 37 saw a stockout due to a demand spike, the recent 3-period demand (P38-P40) has averaged 256 units, which is lower than the early seasonal uptick (P33-P37 avg: 307). However, historical data suggests late November and December are likely to see increased demand for hosiery/socks. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 317 units on-hand and 1076 units in-transit (covering orders from P37-P40), the current pipeline is healthy. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P33-P40) to capture the seasonal regime shift while smoothing out the recent lower-demand weeks, ensuring we stay prepared for the December peak without over-ordering during a temporary dip.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the winter peak for 'Fine-knit trainer socks in a soft cotton blend.' In Period 41, demand was 210 units, which is lower than the recent average (P33-P40 avg was ~292). However, historical context and the product type suggest demand remains volatile but generally higher than the initial pre-game baseline as we enter the holiday season. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 342, with 1086 units in transit. Given the lower demand in the most recent period, I will use a recent window (N=9, covering P33-P41) for mu_hat to capture the current plateau while remaining responsive to the seasonal shift. Sigma_hat is also set to the recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/02. Historical data for this Women's Sock SKU shows a seasonal demand uptick starting around Period 33 (late September), which typically correlates with colder weather. However, the last few weeks (P39-P42) have seen demand fluctuate between 210 and 354 units, with a mean of ~264, which is slightly lower than the P33-P38 average (~301). Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is avoiding stockouts during potential December spikes. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the seasonal regime (P33-P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encompasses the entire 'winter' period observed so far. This period's mean demand is ~286 units, which is a safe baseline for the end-of-year peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. We are in the lead-up to the peak holiday season for 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical demand shows high volatility but a general upward trend linked to colder weather (Period 33 onwards). Period 43 demand was unusually low (143), which is likely a pre-holiday lull before a final December spike. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 516, with 976 units in transit (arrivals from orders in P40, P41, P42, P43). To prepare for potential holiday spikes in the final 4 periods of the game, I will maintain mu_hat based on the 'winter' regime (P33-P43 average demand is ~270, but we expect higher variance). I will use a larger N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility while using a more conservative recent period for mu_hat to ensure we don't over-react to the single low P43 data point.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Pre-holiday demand lull observed in P43 (demand 143), but seasonal winter demand regime (P33-P42 avg ~283) remains the relevant anchor for holiday planning.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (Dec 16, 2019), approaching the peak holiday shopping week. Historically for clothing items, particularly socks ('Fine-knit trainer socks'), we expect a significant demand spike during the two weeks leading up to Christmas. The recent demand history shows a lull in P43 (143) and a moderate P44 (209), which often precedes a major holiday surge. The on-hand inventory is 477 with 941 units in transit, but because the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will not arrive until Period 49\u2014after the game ends at Period 47. However, our objective is to set OR parameters that reflect the expected demand environment. Given the 'socks' category and the December date, I am increasing mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to reflect a high-demand holiday forecast (approx 350 units/period for the next 5 periods) and increasing sigma_hat to account for holiday volatility. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P44 conclusion (P40 order arrived).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge expected: As of Dec 16 (P45), the 'Socks' category is entering peak seasonal demand. Historical patterns for similar items suggest a 20-40% increase in demand during the final two weeks of December.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak holiday demand week for 'Socks'. While recent historical demand (P43-P45) has been relatively low (avg 194), world knowledge strongly suggests a massive spike during the Christmas and post-Christmas sales week. Last period's large order (534) reflects an anticipation of this, but we must ensure the 'mu_hat' parameter reflects the high expected demand for the next lead-time window (P46-P50). Given the carry-over insight suggesting a 20-40% increase for this category in late December and the fact that we are currently IN that peak week, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next 5 periods (Review + Lead Time) based on a baseline of ~290 units plus a 30% holiday surge: (290 * 1.30) * 5 = 1885 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=14) to capture the higher volatility seen since the seasonal shift began in P33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3812.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the peak of the winter holiday season for the 'Socks' category. Historical demand trends and category knowledge suggest that while the immediate post-Christmas week (P46) showed a minor dip, the overall seasonal regime (P33-P46) averages ~266 units, with significant volatility (std dev ~65). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and reliable based on the game history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend's base-stock calculation will naturally target a high service level. I am using the 'recent_N' method for all parameters to ensure the OR engine reacts to the seasonal regime observed since Period 33 (N=14). Specifically, mu_hat and sigma_hat will be derived from the demand patterns of the last 14 periods to capture the elevated winter volatility and mean, protecting against stockouts during the remains of the cold season.
