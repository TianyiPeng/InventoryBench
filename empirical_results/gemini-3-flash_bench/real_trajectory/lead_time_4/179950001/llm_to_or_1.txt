Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the Austin basic leather hip belt. There are 5 weeks of historical demand data ranging from 105 down to 36. The average demand across these 5 samples is 64.6 units per week. The demand shows a clear downward trend from early January (105) to early February (36), likely shifting away from the post-holiday/early-year peak. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My strategy for Period 1 is to use the promised lead time (L=4) and set the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on the available history (N=5) to establish an initial order. Since current on-hand and in-transit are zero, the OR engine will trigger an order to cover the (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=5 reflects the current volume while capturing the recent downward trend in the mean calculation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's leather hip belt. Current inventory is 0 on-hand, which resulted in 40 lost sales in Period 1 since the initial order (109 units) is in-transit (promised lead time: 4 periods). Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a downward trend: 105, 62, 72, 48, 36, and now 40 in P1. The mean demand of all samples is approximately 60.5. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover 5 periods (L+1). L is set to default (4) as we have no data yet to suggest a deviation. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent stabilized lower demand (~40-50 range) rather than the high early January peak. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand inventory is 0, with 186 units in transit. Historical demand shows a downward trend in early February (105 to 36), but the recent demand in Periods 1 and 2 (40, 87) shows high variability and potential recovery. The product (Austin basic leather hip belt) is a staple accessory. Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 haven't arrived yet, which is expected as the promised lead time is 4. Since we have no completed lead-time data to suggest a deviation (L=4 means arrivals start in Period 5), I will stick with the default lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use a recent window (N=5) including the historical and game periods to catch the current demand level, which averages (105+62+72+48+36+40+87)/7 = 64. I will use N=5 of available data points (including historical samples) to estimate current demand levels.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product (Austin basic leather hip belt) has seen zero sales because on-hand inventory has been zero. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (109 units), Period 2 (77 units), and Period 3 (93 units) are all in-transit. Based on the lead-time definition, the Period 1 order (ordered P1, L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 start observation. Historical demand samples (recent 5 weeks: 105, 62, 72, 48, 36) show a declining trend, but the game history demand (P1: 40, P2: 87, P3: 57) suggests a more volatile pattern around an average of ~61. Given profit=1 and holding=1, the critical ratio q = 0.5. I will use recent_N=3 for the demand forecast to capture the volatility seen in the game history while acknowledging the 4-period lead time. No shipments are late yet, as L=4 means the first arrival is expected in P5.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The item is a basic leather hip belt. In periods 1-4, we have seen consistent stockouts (on-hand 0, units sold 0) because the promised lead time L=4 has not elapsed yet for the first order placed in Period 1. Historical demand samples (last 5) show a declining trend from 105 to 36, but game history demand (last 4) shows 40, 87, 57, 61 (average ~61). The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio q = 0.5; the target base stock should roughly equal the median demand over (L+1) periods. Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, we adhere to the promised L=4. For demand forecasting, the last 4 periods of game history represent the most relevant 'recent' regime for the current simulation environment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's leather belt. Historical demand (pre-game + Periods 1-5) shows: 105, 62, 72, 48, 36 (pre-game) and 40, 87, 57, 61, 98 (game). The average demand over these 10 periods is approximately 66.6 units/week. In Period 5, we saw the first arrival (from Period 1) confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. We currently have 11 units on-hand and 198 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4). Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. The current demand trend is slightly rising (last period was 98), but the overall average remains stable. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current game dynamics while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (std dev is significant). L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product 'Austin basic leather hip belt' is experiencing steady demand. Analysis of the first two arrivals (from orders in P1 and P2) confirms that the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6). Consequently, we expect the P3 order (93 units) to arrive in P7 and the P4 order (28 units) in P8. Current on-hand inventory is 38. The average demand over the last 6 periods is 65.5, with recent samples showing 98 and 50. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Recent demand (last 3-4 periods) has stabilized around a mean of 66.5. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture this post-startup demand level and ensure the base stock calculation aligns with the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 and P2 orders both arrived with lead_time=4).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a women's leather hip belt. Current inventory is 74 units on-hand with 202 units in-transit. Based on 'conclude' messages from Periods 5, 6, and 7, we have confirmed that the actual lead time L=4, which matches the promised lead time. Demand history (Samples + Game history) shows: 105, 62, 72, 48, 36 (Pre-game) and 40, 87, 57, 61, 98, 50, 57 (Game periods). Recent demand (last 5 game periods) averages ~64.6 units. The product is a basic accessory, so we expect relatively stable demand, although we observe moderate variability (sigma). I will use L=4 (default), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 7 samples (all available game periods) to capture the current demand regime. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand over (L+1) periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a women's leather belt. Historical demand shows a downward trend after an initial peak, with recent demand averaging around 50 units (last 4 periods: 50, 57, 47, plus the current 48-105 range). Specifically, the last three periods have been 50, 57, 47 (mean ~51). Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods (Promised = Actual). I have 55 units on-hand and 220 in-transit. The in-transit units include orders from Period 5 (arriving Period 9), Period 6 (arriving Period 10), Period 7 (arriving Period 11), and Period 8 (arriving Period 12). Since demand has stabilized significantly lower than the early February peak (which reached 98), I will use N=5 for demand forecasting to capture the recent stable regime while discarding the early volatility. With L=4, mu_hat represents 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's leather belt (Austin basic leather hip belt). Historical demand for the last few weeks (Periods 6-9) has been 50, 57, 47, and 46, which is lower than the initial burst in Periods 1-5. The average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 50. Total demand samples including pre-game range from 36 to 105. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1-P4). In Period 9, the order from Period 5 (which was 0 units) resulted in 0 arrived units, which is consistent with lead_time=4. We currently have 9 units on-hand and 258 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Scheduled arrivals: P10 (P6 order: 108), P11 (P7 order: 66), P12 (P8 order: 46), P13 (P9 order: 38). Since demand has stabilized around 50 units/week, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. L is set to default as the promised 4 periods matches the observed actual lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019/4/22). The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. The order from Period 5 (ordered=0) correctly resulted in zero arrival in Period 9. Demand has stabilized after an initial peak in early March. The last 5 periods (Periods 6-10) show demand values of 50, 57, 47, 46, and 43, indicating a lower and more stable regime compared to the early peaks (near 100). The mean for these last 5 periods is 48.6. Lead time (L) is set to default (4). mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent stability. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the reduced volatility in this regime. Current on-hand (74) and in-transit (150) are being managed to cover the 5-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: Demand stabilized to a mean of ~49 (down from earlier peaks of ~90-100).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's leather belt. Since Period 6 (March 18), the demand has entered a stable regime with a mean of ~49.16 units per week (samples: 50, 57, 47, 46, 43, 50). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7) consistently show an actual lead time of 4 periods. Our current status shows On-hand = 90 and In-transit = 103. The In-transit units correspond to orders from P8 (46 units), P9 (38 units), and P11 (19 units); note that P10 had 0 units ordered. The P8 order is expected to arrive in the resolution phase of the current period (P12). To set parameters, I will use a lead time of 4. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the last 6 periods (since the regime shift at P6) to capture the current mean of ~49 units. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over these 6 periods to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for the stabilized demand levels while respecting the reliable lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 6 (March 18). Over the last 7 periods (P6-P12), the mean demand is approximately 49.5 (50, 57, 47, 46, 43, 50, 58). This aligns with the 'carry-over insight' from Period 11. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods as promised, confirmed by multiple recent arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12). On-hand inventory is 78 units, and in-transit inventory is 109 units (composed of orders from P9=38, P11=19, and P12=52; note that Period 10 had a 0 order). The next expected arrival (from P9) should occur during Period 13 and be visible in the next report. Given the stable demand and reliable lead time, I will use recent_N=7 for demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this stable regime, and the default method for lead time as the promised 4 periods is being met.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. The product is a women's leather hip belt. Demand over the last 8 periods (Period 6 to 13) has averaged 53.8 units/period, showing relative stability compared to the early launch phase, though Period 13 saw a slight uptick (77 units). The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (matches promised). There are no missing shipments currently; arrivals for orders from Periods 10, 11, 12, and 13 are expected in future periods 14-17 (In-transit: 131 units, which includes 0 units from P10 as no order was placed). I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand regime. L is set to default (4). The backend OR will handle the high holding cost (holding=1.0 vs profit=1.0) by reducing the target safety stock (q = 0.5, z* = 0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (2019/5/20), we are facing a critical stockout. The ending on-hand inventory is 0 after a massive demand spike of 139 units in Period 14, which is significantly higher than the previous mean of ~49. This spike coincides with the mid-May period, which often signals a seasonal shift in fashion accessories. The order from Period 10 (ordered=0) resulted in no arrival this period, as expected. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 4, the order placed in Period 11 (19 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 15, and the order from Period 12 (52 units) in Period 16. Total in-transit is 203. Given the recent demand surge (139, 77, 58), the previous 'recent_N' average is too low. I am moving mu_hat to an explicit forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1) to account for this higher demand regime. I will estimate an average demand of 85 units per period for the pipeline (85 * 5 = 425) to trigger aggressive replenishment. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to account for the high volatility seen in Period 14.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Seasonal spike observed (139 units), significantly exceeding the previous ~49 average; mean demand now trending higher (~85) for the late spring/early summer season.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. We are in a confirmed high-demand seasonal regime that began in Period 14 (mid-May). Demand in the last two periods was 139 and 138, which is nearly triple the previous baseline of ~49. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts (lost sales) for two consecutive periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with historical observations (W=4). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this dramatic upward shift (regime length = P14, P15, and the current forecast). Lead time is set to default (4 periods). This ensures the base stock (covering 1+L=5 periods of demand) is calculated against the current high-demand reality rather than being diluted by low early-spring data, helping to recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 14: Seasonal spike sustained with demand >135 for two consecutive periods, requiring parameters to reflect this new baseline of ~138.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal regime for the Austin basic leather hip belt, which started around Period 14 (mid-May). Demand has been consistently high (~138-139 units) for the last three periods, while our previous average was around 49. The current date is June 3rd, 2019. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand is 0) because our previous inventory levels were based on the lower demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To address the stockouts and capture the high seasonal demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot entirely to the new demand level (average ~138). With a lead time of 4 periods, mu_hat will be calculated as (1+4) * 138.33 \u2248 691. This will instruct the OR backend to significantly increase the order size to build the pipeline to support the current 138 units/week pace.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '179950001' (Womens Leather Belt) is clearly in a summer seasonal peak that began around Period 14 (mid-May). Recent demand has been 139, 138, 138, and 121, establishing a new high-demand regime with a mean of approximately 134 units per period (N=4). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts for the last four periods due to this abrupt shift in demand. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrivals of P11, P12, and P13 orders in Periods 15, 16, and 17 respectively. I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this seasonal baseline of ~134 units/period, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand across the 5-period window (L+1). Period 17's demand (121) suggests a slight cooling or stabilization from the 138-139 peak, so N=4 provides a balanced forecast.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 14-17 average is 134 units/period (vs previous baseline of ~49), driven by summer seasonality for women's accessories.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are in a confirmed high-demand summer regime for this women's leather belt. Since Period 14 (May 13), demand has consistently remained high (139, 138, 138, 121, 126), with an average of approximately 132 units per period. Despite placing large orders, we are currently experiencing stockouts due to the significant regime shift and the 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 0 and we have 588 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock target will be the median demand over the protection lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). I will set mu_hat to reflect this new regime (132 * 5 = 660) and sigma_hat to account for the volatility in this period (approx 8.5 * sqrt(5) \u2248 19). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 14-18) will capture this shift accurately.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Austin basic leather hip belt' is currently in a sustained high-demand summer regime (Periods 14-19), with an average demand of approximately 131 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 0, but a large pipeline (540 units) is in transit. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The previous period (P19) saw high demand (122) exactly equal to the arrival from P15, maintaining a state of 0 on-hand inventory. Looking forward, the arrivals expected in Period 20 were ordered in Period 16 (177 units), which should temporarily help meet demand. For Period 20, I am setting L to 'default' (4) as lead times are stable. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 (covering the sustained spike from P14-P19) to capture the current mean demand level of ~131. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the volatility within this high-demand period. These parameters will ensure the base stock calculation properly accounts for the (L+1) window of demand.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is a women's leather hip belt, which saw a sustained demand spike starting in mid-May (Period 14). Demand in the last seven periods (P14-P20) has averaged approximately 126 units per period (139, 138, 138, 121, 126, 122, 98), though the most recent observation shows a slight dip to 98. Despite the dip, summer seasonality remains relevant. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple historical arrivals (P14, P15, P16 all arrived with a 4-period lag). In-transit inventory is high (477 units) due to aggressive ordering in previous periods to catch up with the spike. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand summer regime while acknowledging the recent slight variance, and set L to default (4 periods). This ensures the base stock reflects the current season's requirements.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. We are in the middle of the summer season for women's accessories. Looking at the demand history, we saw a significant peak between Period 14 and Period 19 (avg ~131 units), which has since softened in the last two periods (Period 20-21 avg ~96 units). While demand is still higher than the early spring baseline of ~49, the peak summer surge appears to be tapering slightly. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods, with the Period 17 order arriving exactly on time. On-hand inventory is now healthy at 125 units with 411 in-transit. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Periods 14-21) to capture this higher summer baseline while acknowledging the recent stabilization, effectively setting mu_hat for the (L+1) window at approximately 610 units (5 * ~122).

Carry-over insight: Demand transitioned from a peak summer surge (>130) to a sustained high-summer baseline (~96) starting Period 20.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the austin basic leather hip belt has stabilized into a mid-summer regime. Following the initial peak (Periods 14-19: avg ~134), the last three periods (20-22) show a distinct step down to an average of 89 units per period (98, 94, 75). This downward trend suggests the peak summer surge has passed, transitioning to a stable but lower high-summer baseline. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 18 order. I am setting L to default (4), and mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this latest demand shift (averaging ~89/period over (1+L)=5 periods). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current reduced volatility as the regime stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime step-down starting Period 20: Demand decreased from peak summer levels (~134) to a stabilized late-summer baseline of ~89 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Austin basic leather hip belt' (a summer-dependent accessory) has transitioned from its peak summer surge (P14-P19 average ~131) to a stabilized late-summer baseline (P20-P23 average ~85). The current period date is June 22nd. The last four demand observations are 98, 94, 75, and 72, showing a clear downward stabilization trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory levels are currently high with 201 units on-hand and 262 units in-transit, largely due to the peak-demand orders arriving after the demand began to soften. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current stabilized lower baseline and avoid over-ordering, while keeping the lead time at 4. The OR backend will use these values to determine the appropriate order amount to maintain the service level while managing holding costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the basic leather hip belt is continuing its seasonal step-down as we move further into late summer. The demand in Period 24 was 52 units, following a sequence of 98, 94, 75, and 72 units. This confirms that the high-summer peak (>130) is over, and we are now seeing a return toward the historical baseline observed earlier in the year (~49-60). The current on-hand inventory is 263 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand (covering roughly 3.5 to 5 periods), and there are still 148 units in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to reflect this recent lower-demand regime. Using N=5 for the most recent periods (20-24) gives an average demand of 78.2 units per period. This will signal the OR backend to restrict further ordering until the current inventory cushion is naturally reduced by sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: Demand dropped to 52 units, confirming a return towards the spring baseline (~50-60) after the summer peak (~134) and high-summer stabilization (~89).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 179950001 (Women's leather belt) has transitioned out of the peak summer season. Historically, demand spiked from Period 14 through Period 19 (~130 units), stabilized in high-summer (Periods 20-23 approx ~85 units), and has now dropped significantly in the last two periods (Period 24: 52, Period 25: 66). This signals a return to the pre-summer baseline demand regime observed around Periods 6-12 (~50-60 units). The current on-hand inventory (271) plus in-transit stock (74) totals 345 units. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Our current total inventory (345) represents approximately 5-6 weeks of stock at the new regime's mean (~60). Since holding cost equals profit ($1.00), excess inventory is as damaging as stockouts. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new lower-demand regime (avg ~63), which will naturally lead the OR backend to stop ordering until inventory levels normalize to this lower baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: Summer peak has ended, demand returned to baseline of ~60 units/period (observed 52 and 66 in P24-P25).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 179950001 (Women's leather belt) has stabilized after the summer peak. The latest three observations (P24: 52, P25: 66, P26: 69) average 62.3, confirming the transition back to a baseline regime. Current on-hand inventory is 276 units with no units in transit. Using the (L+1) demand coverage logic with L=4, we need to cover demand for approximately 5 periods. At the current mean (~62), the required base stock is roughly 310 units. Since 276 is already on hand and recent demand is stable, no large order is needed, but we should align parameters with this recent regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-summer baseline (P24-P26). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Austin basic leather hip belt' has transitioned out of its summer peak (which saw demand >130 units) and has stabilized over the last four periods (P24-P27) at an average of 62.5 units (52, 66, 69, 63). This confirms the demand regime shift back toward the base level identified in the carry-over insights. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (213 units) due to the tail-end of summer orders arriving as demand cooled. We have 36 units in-transit (ordered P27). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand baseline, the OR engine will likely result in a near-zero order to burn off excess stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P24-P27).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26). Demand has stabilized at a lower baseline post-summer peak, though recent samples (P27: 63, P28: 84) suggest a slight uptick from the lower baseline of ~60 seen in early August. This could be early 'back-to-school' interest for accessories. The on-hand inventory is 129 and in-transit is 100 (from P27 and P28 orders), totaling 229 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the target service level is 50%, centering the inventory on the expected demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent post-peak demand trend (periods 24-28: 52, 66, 69, 63, 84; mean \u2248 67). I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility of this baseline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Historical demand data shows a clear stabilization in demand following the summer peak. After the high-summer surge (~134 units/period) and a late-summer step-down (~89 units/period), the demand has settled into a post-summer regime. For the last 6 periods (P24-P29), demand has averaged 69.5 units (52, 66, 69, 63, 84, 83), with a slight upward trend in the most recent two weeks likely due to early autumn shopping or 'back-to-school' patterns. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 46 units on-hand and 186 in-transit (total pipeline of 232), the inventory position is roughly 3.3 periods of coverage at current demand levels. I am choosing N=6 for mu_hat to reflect this current regime (avg ~70) while capturing the recent uptick, ensuring the OR backend order covers the safety stock requirements for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime confirmed starting Period 24: Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~70 units/period (observed range 52-84 over P24-P29), significantly lower than the summer peak of ~134.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Austin basic leather hip belt' is currently in a post-summer demand phase. Demand spiked to 111 in Period 30, which is higher than the previously established post-summer baseline of ~70. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 276 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals from orders placed in Period 27 (36 units), Period 28 (64 units), Period 29 (86 units), and Period 30 (90 units) to arrive in Periods 31, 32, 33, and 34 respectively. The current 0 on-hand inventory indicates a stockout situation at the end of Period 30. To address the recent volatility and the demand jump to 111, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=7, covering the window since Period 24) to capture the current stabilization level (avg ~75) while allowing for the recent spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility observed in Period 30 (111 units) suggests a potential departure from the ~70 units/period baseline; monitoring for a new higher stabilization level.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand in the last two periods (111 and 100) has significantly exceeded the previous post-summer baseline of ~70. This suggests a secondary autumn peak or a sustained increase in demand for this item (Austin basic leather hip belt), likely coinciding with fall fashion transitions. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the Period 31 conclusion (P27 order arrived on time). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the demand surge outstripping supply. Total in-transit is 342 (from orders in P28, P29, P30, and P31). To capture this new demand level and minimize stockouts, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N approach. I'll use N=3 to capture the sudden upward shift observed since Period 30 (Demand: 83, 111, 100), yielding a mean around 98. This will increase the order quantity to better align with the 5-period requirement (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 30: Demand has increased from a post-summer baseline of ~70 to a new autumn baseline of ~100 units/period (observed 111 and 100 in P30-P31).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 179950001 (Women's leather belt) has transitioned into an autumn baseline. A confirmed regime shift at Period 30 shows demand has increased from a post-summer mean of ~70 to an autumn mean of approximately 100 units/period (observed 111, 100, and 89 in P30-P32). The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are relying on pipeline arrivals. The pipeline contains 400 units (from orders in P29, P30, P31, P32). Since L=4, my parameters cover a total window of L+1=5 periods. mu_hat is set to roughly (5 periods * 100 units/period) = 500. Using the recent_N method with N=3 for mu_hat specifically targets the recent autumn stabilization (Period 30-32). For sigma_hat, recent_N with N=3 captures the current volatility in this new regime, which is higher than the stable late-summer period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Austin basic leather hip belt' (179950001) is currently exhibiting a strong autumn peak. Period 33 observed a massive spike to 189 units, following a stabilization at approximately 100 units/period (P30-P32). This pattern suggests that demand has non-linearly accelerated as we move into late September/October, common for accessory transitions. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with a pipeline of 414 units. To avoid further stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 (covering the start of this autumn regime P30-P33) to capture the recent mean of ~122.25 units/period. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility seen in the Period 33 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed starting Period 33: Demand spiked to 189 units, bringing the 4-period autumn mean to ~122 (up from the P30-P32 baseline of ~100).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Austin basic leather hip belt' is currently in an autumn growth phase. While Period 33 saw a massive spike (189), Period 34 returned to a more moderate level (95). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 117 units. As we head into October, demand for accessories often remains elevated or continues to climb toward holiday peaks. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 521 units in-transit. Arrivals have been consistent with a 4-period lead time. I am setting mu_hat using a recent 5-period average (L+1 = 5 periods, mean ~117, so mu_hat ~ 585) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the current autumn demand level, while maintaining sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in the autumn regime: after a spike to 189 in Period 33, demand settled to 95 in Period 34; the 5-period average (P30-P34) is 116.8 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Austin basic leather hip belt' is currently in an autumn regime that started around Period 30. Recent demand samples are 111, 100, 89, 189, 95, and 90 (Periods 30-35). While Period 33 was a significant outlier (189), the broader average for this 6-period window is ~112. The historical trend suggests that autumnal demand for women's accessories can be volatile but sustains a higher baseline than the late-summer period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (12), but a large pipeline (482) is in transit, with the Period 32 order (122 units) expected to arrive this period. I will use the recent 6 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher autumnal mean (~112) and the associated volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the expected lead time and the upcoming period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (Period 30-35) shows a mean baseline of ~112 units/period, characterized by high volatility (range 89-189).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the basic leather hip belt is currently in an autumn regime (starting Period 30) characterized by high volatility. While demand spiked to 189 in Period 33, subsequent periods have stabilized at 95, 90, and 97. The mean demand for this recent regime (P30-P36, N=7) is 110.1 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 37 units with a substantial pipeline of 428 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility observed (range 89-189) and the product's high service level requirement (profit and holding cost are equal, suggesting a 50% critical fractile, but the OR backend uses a capped policy aiming for higher coverage), I will use the recent 7-period window to capture this higher mean and variance compared to the summer baseline. This will ensure we maintain sufficient stock for potential late-autumn spikes while managing the risk of overstocking if demand reverts to the ~70 range.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent autumn demand regime (Period 30 onwards) has stabilized around a mean of ~110 units per period. While Period 33 was an outlier (189 units), demand in the last three periods (P35-P37) has been very consistent (90, 97, 98), averaging 95 units. However, looking at the full autumn window (P30-P37), the average is 108.6. Given the product's seasonality (winter accessories likely peaking soon as we enter late October) and the high volatility observed in September, I will use a conservative recent_N=8 to capture the full autumn regime including the volatility, which results in a mu_hat of ~543 (5 * 108.6). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (39), but significant pipeline inventory (414) is scheduled to arrive, covering nearly 4 weeks of demand. My parameters aim to maintain service levels during this active autumn season without excessive overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand (Period 30-37) average has stabilized at ~109 units/period, with reduced volatility in the most recent three periods (avg ~95).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/04. We are in the late autumn regime. Recent demand has shown a significant drop in Period 38 (48 units) compared to the previous autumn baseline of ~109 units (P30-P37). This drop likely reflects a transition away from the autumn peak toward a potentially lower late-autumn/pre-holiday level, or simply high volatility characteristic of this SKU. The 10-period average (P29-P38) is 100.8 units, but the most recent 5-period average (P34-P38) is 85.6 units. Given the recent drop to 48, I will use recent_N (N=5) to adjust the mu_hat toward this lower recent average (approx 86 units/period) while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. On-hand inventory is 188, and In-transit is 308, which is substantial. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime softening observed in Period 38 (48 units); monitoring for a transition from the autumn baseline (~109) to a lower late-autumn level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-169.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Austin basic leather hip belt' (a seasonal accessory) has clearly transitioned from an autumn baseline of ~109 units/period (P30-P37) to a significantly lower late-autumn/early-winter level. The last two periods (P38-P39) show demand of 48 and 41 units, confirming the softening trend noted in the previous period. I will now classify P38-P39 as a new demand regime. To avoid over-ordering during this seasonal slowdown, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3, to capture the transition) which will bring the forecast down to ~63 units/period (avg of 98, 48, 41), preventing excess inventory accumulation. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand and in-transit inventory (total 455) is significantly higher than the projected pipeline need (forecast 63 * 5 = 315), so the OR backend should naturally minimize ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Demand has dropped from the autumn baseline (~109) to a late-autumn level of ~45 units/period (observed 48 and 41 in P38-P39).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the basic leather hip belt has entered a late-autumn softening phase. Following the autumn baseline of ~109 units (Periods 30-37), demand has significantly dropped in the last three periods: Period 38 (48 units), Period 39 (41 units), and Period 40 (29 units). This consistent three-period decline confirms a new regime with a mean of ~39 units/period. The current inventory position is high, with 249 units on-hand and 177 units in-transit (a total of 426 units), which covers roughly 10 periods of demand at the new baseline. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I have set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 3-period window (N=3) to reflect this lower demand level and ensure the OR backend does not place further orders while the system clears current stock levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38 confirmed: Demand has dropped from the autumn baseline (~109) to a late-autumn baseline of ~39 units/period (observed 48, 41, and 29 in P38-P40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Austin basic leather hip belt has entered a late-autumn/early-winter low-demand regime, confirmed since Period 38. The demand values for the last four periods (48, 41, 29, 33) result in a recent mean of ~38 units per period, a significant drop from the autumn average of ~109. With the current on-hand inventory at 302 and 91 units in-transit (ordered in Period 38), the total pipeline inventory (393) far exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (L=4, so 5 periods * 38 units = 190 units). I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new low-demand baseline and avoid further accumulation of expensive holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked unexpectedly to 227 units, potentially signaling a pre-holiday surge or a Black Friday/Cyber Monday event for women's accessories. This contrasts sharply with the late-autumn baseline of ~39 observed over Periods 38-41. With 166 units on hand and 0 in-transit (Lead Time=4), the current inventory covers roughly 0.7 periods of this new peak demand but over 4 periods of the late-autumn baseline. Given the date (Dec 2), high volatility is expected throughout December. I will use 'explicit' values to prepare for a sustained holiday regime. I estimate a holiday mean (mu_hat) around 150 units/period (reflecting the spike and subsequent holiday expectations) over the L+1 window, with high volatility (sigma_hat) to account for the risk of stockouts during the peak season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed in Period 42 (227 units), following a late-autumn trough; monitoring for a sustained December peak regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a dramatic transition: a late-autumn trough (averaging ~35 units in P39-P41) followed by a massive holiday spike in P42 (227 units) and a significant follow-on in P43 (87 units). Current date is Dec 9, indicating we are in the peak holiday shopping window for 'Austin basic leather hip belt'. While P43 demand (87) was lower than P42, it is still more than double the late-autumn baseline. I expect high demand to persist for at least 2-3 more periods as the December holiday season continues. Current on-hand inventory is 79, which is insufficient if another 200+ unit week occurs. The OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock to cover (L+1) demand. I will use 'explicit' values to capture the anticipated high holiday volume (forecasting a mean of 150 units/period for the next 5 periods) and high volatility observed in P42. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: Peak demand of 227 units (P42) followed by 87 units (P43); expecting sustained high demand (>100 avg) through mid-December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (Dec 16), the heart of the December holiday season for women's accessories. Demand is currently in a high-volatility holiday regime: Period 42 saw a massive spike (227), Period 43 settled to 87, and Period 44 reached 108. The average over the last three periods (P42-P44) is 140.6 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and although 526 units are in-transit, recent arrivals (P43, P44) have been 0 units because the previous ordering cycle was dormant during the late-autumn trough. The orders placed in P43 (265 units) and P44 (261 units) are not expected until P47 and P48 respectively. To protect against stockouts during the Christmas/New Year peak, I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the current holiday average of ~141 units/period. Over the (L+1) horizon (5 weeks), this requires a total coverage of ~705 units. With 526 units in-transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary gap. I am using recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture the extreme variance of the holiday spikes.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42 onwards) mean is ~141 units/period with high volatility (range 87-227), significantly higher than the late-autumn baseline of ~39.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/23). Recent demand (P42-P45) has averaged 131.5 units/period, with a massive spike of 227 in P42 and stabilized high demand around 104-108 in the last two periods. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) while waiting for significant orders placed in P43-P45 (total 705 units) to arrive. The next arrival (ordered P43) is expected in P47 based on the confirmed 4-period lead time. Given the high profitability ($1) relative to holding cost ($1) and the high volatility of the holiday regime (mean ~141 per Carry-over Insight P45), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly high levels (150 units/period * 5 periods = 750) to ensure the OR engine maintains a strong base stock to capture remaining holiday demand and potential post-holiday clearance activity. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, marking the end of the holiday season and the end of the game. For SKU 179950001 (Austin basic leather hip belt), demand has been high during the holiday regime (P42 onwards mean ~119 units/period). However, looking at the historical data from identical dates in the previous year (provided samples: 2019-01-07: 105, 2019-01-14: 62, 2019-01-21: 72, 2019-01-28: 48, 2019-02-04: 36), there is a clear downward trend in demand throughout January after the holiday peak. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 750 units in-transit (ordered in P43-P46). Given that lead time is consistently 4 periods, the P43 order (265 units) is expected to arrive next period (P47). The total pipeline plus expected arrival is more than sufficient to cover the projected January demand softening. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P42-P46) which captures the holiday peak and the start of the deceleration, while relying on the existing large pipeline to avoid unnecessary holding costs as demand returns to early-year baselines (~50-70 units).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration observed: Demand dropped from 104 (P45) to 72 (P46), aligning with early-year historical samples (Jan/Feb mean ~65).
