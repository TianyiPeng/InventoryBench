Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is a 'Womens Casual' jersey tank top with lace trims (572797002). Based on the available demand history (average ~80.8 units/week), demand appears stable with no immediate seasonal spike visible in the early February data. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock to cover the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (using the 5 provided historical samples) to capture current demand levels. L is set to 'default' (4) as no actual lead time data is yet available to suggest a deviation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the product 'ESSENTIAL TANKTOP LACE TVP' and the date, we are approaching spring/summer, where demand for vest tops typically increases. Historically, demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan-early Feb) averaged 80.8 units per week. However, in Period 1 (Feb 11), we saw a jump to 105 units. Since we started with 0 inventory, all Period 1 demand was lost. An order of 104 units was placed in Period 1 but has not arrived yet, which is expected given the promised lead time (L) of 4. Per the 'Lead Time Definition', the earliest an order placed in Period 1 can arrive is Period 5. To ensure we cover demand during the (L+1) window, I will use a conservative forecast. Given the recent demand sample (105) and the upward seasonal trend for tank tops, I'll set mu_hat using the last 6 samples (initial 5 + Period 1) to capture the trend without over-reacting to a single spike. Sigma_hat will use the default to capture full volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a Women's Casual Lace Tanktop. Initial demand (92, 68, 85, 95, 64) averaged ~81. However, demand in P1 and P2 (105, 163) shows a sharp upward trend, likely due to spring seasonality transition. On-hand remains 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods; orders from P1/P2 are in-transit and not expected to arrive until P5/P6. Currently, we have 216 units in transit (104 from P1, 112 from P2). mu_hat needs to account for (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Using the most recent 5 samples (95, 64, 105, 163, and an estimated next period demand ~140) to better capture the recent surge. The mean of the last 4 known samples (95, 64, 105, 163) is 106.75. Given the clear seasonality and the high critical ratio (19/(19+1)=0.95), I will set mu_hat conservatively high using 'recent_N' to match the rising trend and ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock to cover demand during the long lead-time window.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'ESSENTIAL TANKTOP LACE TVP' is experiencing a significant demand surge as we enter March, likely due to seasonal transition towards spring apparel. Historical samples ranged from 64-95, but actual demand in Periods 1-3 has jumped to 105, 163, and 162. The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~143.3. Promised lead time is 4 periods; therefore, the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in the P6 conclude message). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 380 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). We are out of stock and losing sales. I will set mu_hat using the recent 3 observations to capture this higher demand regime (approx 143/week). With L=4, the base stock target needs to cover 5 weeks of demand (1 + L). Since we've had 0 arrivals yet, we cannot infer a true lead time drift, so I will stick with the promised L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 2019: Mean increased from ~80 to ~143 (+78%) as spring season approaches.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/11. The SKU 'ESSENTIAL TANKTOP LACE TVP' is a spring/summer seasonal item. Historical demand samples from Jan/early Feb showed a mean of ~80, but since Period 1 (mid-Feb), demand has surged significantly (105, 163, 162, 207), averaging ~159 over the last 4 periods. The carry-over insight noted a shift to ~143, but the most recent period hit 207, indicating an accelerating trend as we enter March. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods; the first order placed in Period 1 (104 units) is expected to arrive DURING Period 5 and become visible in Period 6. The pipeline (in-transit) of 578 units matches the sum of orders from Periods 1-4 (104+112+164+198). I will use L=default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead-time shift. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=4 to capture the high-demand regime of the last four weeks (mean ~159), resulting in target inventory for 5 periods. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: March demand (P4) reached 207, exceeding the previously noted regime mean of 143; 4-week average now stands at 159.25.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's lace tank top, naturally seeing a seasonal surge as spring approaches. Period 5 confirmed the first arrival (104 units ordered P1) exactly on the promised lead time of 4 periods. However, on-hand inventory is currently 0 because demand (105) wiped out the arrival (104). Total units in-transit (703) cover the orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 105, 163, 162, 207, and 105. The drop in P5 demand to 105 likely reflects a stockout limitation (sold 104, demand recorded 105) rather than a true cooling of demand, as we have been stockout-constrained for several weeks. Since the shift began at P2 (Feb 18), I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the 'High Season' regime which averages ~159 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Spring seasonality for women's tank tops driving demand from ~80 to ~160 (+100%) starting mid-February.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's tank top with lace trims - a seasonal item for spring/summer. The historical demand before Feb was ~80. Since Feb starting at P1, the demands were 105, 163, 162, 207, 105 (anomaly/out of stock), and 190. Excluding the OOS-constrained Period 5, the recent 5-period demand average is approx 165. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and 'conclude' messages for P5 and P6 confirm the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5; P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 0, and there is a pipeline of 820 units (orders from P3 to P6). Given the spring season and recent trend, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 samples (~155/week) to cover the 5-period window (L+1), resulting in ~775 units. Sigma_hat is set to default calculation using recent data to handle the variance seen during this ramp-up.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are managing a women's tank top SKU at the start of April (Period 8). On-hand inventory is 0, indicating we are consistently selling out due to the spring seasonal surge. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory is 770 units (composed of P4: 198, P5: 229, P6: 229, P7: 114). Demand in the last four periods (March) has been 207, 105 (constrained by arrivals), 190, and 210, averaging 178 units. Given the transition into April, we expect this high spring demand to persist or increase. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this March/April regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will provide a base stock target that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~890 units). With 770 in transit and 0 on hand, the system needs to order to reach this target while being constrained by the OR engine's safety cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed 178 units/week (March avg) as spring peak continues for women's tank tops. Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's tank top with lace trims, which is seeing a significant seasonal demand increase as we move into April (Period 9). Historical demand samples from January (64\u201395) are no longer relevant. Recent demand (last 4 periods) has increased steadily: 105, 190, 210, 220, averaging approximately 181 units per week. The last two weeks (210, 220) suggest the peak may be stabilizing or continuing to climb. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand is outstripping late arrivals, though the lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). To avoid stockouts during this spring peak, I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher regime. L is set to default as the promised 4-period lead time is consistently being met.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustaining in April: Last two periods demand (210, 220) confirms a new floor above 200 units/week, up from the March average of 178.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's tank top, which is currently experiencing peak spring/pre-summer demand. Recent weekly demand (P7-P9: 210, 220, 188) maintains a high average of 206 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is perfectly consistent with all historical arrivals (P5-P9 arrivals were all exactly 4 periods). Since the on-hand inventory is low (41 units) and demand has stabilized at a high level, I will use recent history (N=3) to capture the current demand regime. With L=4 (promised) and a 1-period review cycle, the pipeline must cover 5 periods of demand. This approach protects against stockouts during this high-demand seasonal period while respecting the OR backend's inventory balancing logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a high level in April: 3-period average (P7-P9) is 206 units, establishing a persistent spring peak regime. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Demand has stabilized at a high level; the last 4 periods (P7-P10) show demands of 210, 220, 188, and 208, giving an average of 206.5 units per week. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P1-P6 orders arrived exactly L+4). Since the demand regime shifted and stabilized above 200 units starting from Period 7, I will use recent_N=4 to capture this 'high spring' plateau. This ensures mu_hat is based on ~206.5 units/period and adjusts the inventory position to maintain the high service level (q = 19/20 = 95%) required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late April (2019/4/29), entering the peak season for women's tank tops. There has been a significant and sudden demand spike in Period 11 (337 units), which is much higher than the previous April plateau of ~206 units. This suggests we are moving from a standard spring regime into a pre-summer peak. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the unexpected stockout (sold 176 out of 337 demand). The lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (Periods 5-11). To recover from the stockout and prepare for sustained high demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent upward trajectory (avg of 188, 208, 337 is ~244 per week). Given the high volatility introduced by the latest spike (std dev of 79.5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for sigma_hat to ensure the safety stock is responsive to this new uncertainty. The goal is to maximize availability during this high-profit window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 11: End-of-April demand spiked to 337 units, representing a ~60% increase over the previous 3-week average (~206). Transitioning from spring plateau to summer peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in the lead-up to the summer peak for the 'Essential Tanktop Lace TVP'. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 11 (337 units) and a moderate following week (197 units), suggesting high volatility as we transition seasons. The average demand over the last four periods (P9-P12) is ~232.5 units, which is a step up from the April average of ~206. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P12 arrival). With on-hand inventory at 63 and a high pipeline, we need to maintain a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the higher volatility observed recently. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime and the last 6 periods for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance since the Period 11 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized in May: 4-week average (P9-P12) increased to 232.5 units from April's 206 (+13%), driven by summer seasonality for women's tank tops.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/05/13). The product is a women's tank top, which is entering peak summer seasonality. Looking at the demand history, there was a significant dip in Period 13 (67 units) following a surge in Period 11 (337 units). However, the overall trend for this SKU has shown a transition from a ~180 unit average in March to a ~232 unit average in May. The low demand in Period 13 may be a weekly fluctuation rather than a regime shift downward, given the product's seasonal relevance. I will treat the recent volatility as part of the current summer ramp-up. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have seen recent 'lost sales' due to stockouts in Period 11, I will use a recent N (5 periods) for demand estimation to capture the higher summer average while smoothing out the outlier dip in Period 13. This ensures mu_hat is based on the recent higher-demand regime (approx. 200+ units/week).

Daily Reward (R_t): $777.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '572797002' (Essential Tanktop Lace TVP) is showing a significant demand drop in the last two periods (May 6th: 67 units, May 13th: 61 units) compared to the over 200+ unit average observed during March and April. This suggests the spring/early summer peak for this specific item may have peaked or shifted, resulting in a sudden accumulation of inventory (currently 382 on-hand). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on systematic arrivals from periods 1 through 10. To avoid excessive holding costs from the high pipeline inventory (907 units), I am switching to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3. This captures the recent lower demand trend (mean of ~108 over P12-P14) more accurately than a long-term average, which still contains the high-demand April peak. This will significantly lower the base stock target and prevent further over-ordering while the system digests the existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 14: After a high-performance spring peak (~200+ units), demand has dropped significantly in May to ~64 units over the last 2 periods, suggesting a potential seasonal cooldown or post-peak correction.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797002 (Ladies' Lace Tanktop) is experiencing a post-spring deceleration. Demand in May has fluctuated (67, 61, 162) compared to the April peak (averaging ~200+, spiking to 337). The 3-period average for May is approximately 96.6 units, while the most recent reading was 162. Given this volatility and high on-hand/in-transit levels (419 on-hand + 708 in-transit = 1127 total units), we must set parameters that reflect the shift to a lower consumption regime to avoid excessive holding costs. The promised lead time (L=4) remains stable as confirmed by P15's arrival message. I am selecting 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent May downturn while acknowledging the slight rebound in P15. sigma_hat will also use N=3 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed in May 2019: 3-period average dropped to ~97 units from April's ~200+ average (-50% approx), following the end of the spring peak fashion cycle. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797002 (Womens Casual Essential Tanktop) is currently in a transitional demand phase. After a significant downshift in May (averaging ~97 units over P13-P14), demand has rebounded in the last two periods (P15: 162, P16: 209), suggesting a secondary summer peak or higher baseline for June. The current on-hand inventory is high (588 units) due to large orders placed during the April peak arriving now. Pipeline inventory includes orders from P13 (279), P14 (51), and P15-16 (0), totaling 330 units. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on the consistent 'conclude' messages. To avoid further overstocking while accounting for the recent demand recovery, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the May-June transition (P13-P16 avg ~137), which results in a balanced (1+L) forecast. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility seen in this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected in late May/early June: After a mid-May dip to ~64 units, demand increased to 162 (P15) and 209 (P16), indicating a potential secondary summer peak or stabilized June baseline higher than May lows.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797002 (Womens Casual Lace Tanktop) is in the middle of its summer season (June). Following a significant dip in May demand, sales have stabilized over the last three periods (P15-P17) with demands of 162, 209, and 180, resulting in a 3-period average of 183.7. Current on-hand inventory is high at 687 units due to large orders placed during the April peak (P12-P13) arriving now. With L=4, the base stock targets a 5-period window (~918 units). Current total inventory (on-hand 687 + in-transit 51 = 738) is slightly below the target, but the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $19.0 suggests maintaining a high service level. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across all 13 concluded shipments. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period stabilized demand level (~184/week) to account for the current June baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in June after May fluctuations: 3-period average (P15-P17) is 183.7 units, establishing a summer baseline for women's tank tops.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for the 'Essential Tanktop Lace' has stabilized over the last four periods (P15-P18) with values of 162, 209, 180, and 157. This yields a 4-period average of 177 units, confirming a consistent summer baseline after the volatile May period. The lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 14 order. Currently, we have high on-hand inventory (581 units) and a moderate pipeline (223 units). Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend targets a high service level. Using a recent_N of 4 for demand parameters will align the base stock level with the proven 177-unit average, preventing further overstocking while covering the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in June 2019: 4-period average (P15-P18) is 177 units, establishing a consistent summer plateau for women's tank tops. Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797002 (Womens Casual Tank Top) is currently in a stable summer demand regime. Following fluctuations in May, demand has stabilized in June. The 5-period average (P15-P19) is 187.6 units (162, 209, 180, 157, 230). Period 19 demand (230) is the highest in this recent window, suggesting a potential upward trend or typical summer volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P14 order arrived in P18). Current inventory (On-hand: 351, In-transit: 391) equals 742 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current 187.6 average. To maintain a healthy safety stock for the (L+1) = 5 period horizon, I will use a recent_N window of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer plateau accurately while being responsive to the slight recent uptick.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in June 2019: 5-period average (P15-P19) is 187.6 units, maintaining a consistent summer plateau for women's tank tops.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Women's Casual Lace Tanktop', highly seasonal for summer. Current date is 2019/07/01. Demand in Period 20 spiked to 366 units, a significant jump from the previous 5-week average of ~188 (+95%). This indicates a peak summer demand regime, likely driven by July weather. Historically, we saw a similar spike to 337 in late April (P11). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 630 units in transit. Specifically, orders from P15, P16, and P17 were for 0 units. The next expected arrival (from P18) of 223 units should arrive in Period 22 (read in P23). We are currently in a stockout. Given the prompt for summer demand, I am shifting the mu_hat to reflect this new regime using a recent_N of 3 to capture the acceleration (averaging ~251 units/week). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 20: July demand spiked to 366 units, nearly doubling the June average of ~188, signaling a peak summer demand phase for women's tank tops.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Essential Tank Top (SKU 572797002) is currently in a high-volatility summer peak regime. The most recent demand sample was 174, following a high of 366. The last 3 periods (P19-P21) show an average demand of 256.7 units. Carry-over insights highlight a regime shift in July (P20), and with the current date being July 8th, high summer demand is expected to persist. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P18). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a significant pipeline of 1056 units. However, because of the 4-period lead time, we must ensure the 'base_stock' covers demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Given the current jump in demand and high volatility (standard deviation of recent samples is approx 99), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime for both mean and standard deviation. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the current summer peak while the capped policy prevents over-ordering against the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for July summer peak: 3-period average (P19-P21) is 256.7 units, showing increased volume and volatility compared to the June average (~188).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '572797002' (Essential Tanktop Lace TVP) is in its peak summer season (July 15). Demand has shown high volatility: spiking to 366 in P20, then dropping to 174 (P21) and 121 (P22). However, historical data from similar spring/summer transitions suggests this might be a temporary correction or variation in a high-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P18 order in P22 (Lead time = 4). No orders were placed in P15-P17, which explains the stockouts in P20-P21. Large orders placed in P21 (426) and P22 (420) are currently in-transit. To handle the high volatility and ensure recovery from the recent stockout while accounting for the high summer demand, I am using a recent_N (N=8) approach for mu_hat to capture the broader summer trend (average ~183 units/week) rather than over-reacting to the very low P22 demand. Sigma_hat is also set via recent_N (N=8) to capture the increased volatility of the summer peak (std ~78), which provides a larger safety buffer for the base_stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in July: After a spike to 366 (P20), demand dropped to 174 (P21) and 121 (P22); the 4-period average (P19-P22) is 222 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a women's lace tank top, currently in the peak summer season. Observed demand has been volatile in July (366, 174, 121, 132), with the recent 4-period average settling around 200 units/week. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P18 arrived P22, P19 arrived P23). Demand in the most recent two periods (121, 132) suggests the massive July spike (366) was a temporary peak rather than a new sustained floor. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this post-spike stabilization while remaining responsive to summer volume. sigma_hat is also set to the last 4 periods to account for the high July volatility. Pipeline inventory is currently high (1085 units) due to large orders placed in Periods 20-22, which are expected to arrive in Periods 24-26, so the OR backend will likely order 0 this period to prevent overstocking as we move toward late summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed for July summer peak: after a spike to 366 (P20), demand settled at a 4-period average (P20-P23) of 200 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/07/29), we are in the peak summer season for women's tank tops. Demand has shown high volatility in July, with a significant spike to 366 (P20) followed by a stabilization phase. The 5-period average (P20-P24) is 209.4 units, which aligns with a high-demand summer regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have 123 units on hand and 1035 units in transit (covering recent large orders from P21 and P22), the inventory position is strong. To capture the current summer demand level while accounting for the recent volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for demand forecasting (N=5 to cover the July period) and continue with the stable lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for July summer peak: 5-period average (P20-P24) is 209.4 units, maintaining higher volumes despite weekly volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August 2019. The product is a women's tank top with lace trims, which has exhibited strong seasonality. Demand spiked in July (reaching 366 at Period 20) but has since cooled down, with Period 25 recording only 99 units. This suggests the peak summer demand is beginning to subside as we move into August. The 5-period average (P21-P25) is approximately 156 units, which is a significant drop from the ~210 average seen earlier in July. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With 450 units on-hand and 873 units in-transit, our pipeline is very full (1323 units total) relative to the slowing demand. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the downward trend in demand, and maintain the default lead time. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility observed during the mid-summer peak-to-trough transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift detected in August 2019: Early August demand (P25) dropped to 99 units, bringing the 5-period average down to ~156 units from the July plateau of ~200+, signaling the end of the peak summer season.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for the 'Essential Tanktop Lace' is showing a clear seasonal downshift as the peak summer season (July) concludes. The last two periods have seen significantly lower demand (99, 79) compared to the July average (~200+). We currently have 791 units on-hand and 453 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 24 and 25), totaling 1,244 units of pipeline inventory. Given that the 5-period average has dropped to approximately 156 units and recent weekly demand is <100, our existing inventory is more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). To avoid excessive holding costs during this post-peak phase, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the downward trend effectively. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed in August 2019: 2-period average (P25-P26) dropped to 89 units from July's ~200+ average (-55%), signaling the transition out of summer peak demand for tank tops.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Essential Tank Top (Womens Casual) has entered a significant post-summer downshift as of mid-August 2019. Demand for the most recent periods (P25-P27) was 99, 79, and 53 units respectively, showing a clear declining trend. The 3-period average is ~77 units, which is a sharp drop from the July average of ~200+. Current on-hand inventory is 738 units, and in-transit is 453 units (ordered in P24 and P25). Given the current demand trajectory, the total pipeline (1191 units) is sufficient to cover more than 15 weeks of demand at the current rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this post-peak regime and prevent further overstocking while we work through high inventory levels. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend due to the high stock position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed mid-August: 3-period average (P25-P27) dropped to 77 units from July's ~200+ average, reflecting the end of summer seasonality for tank tops.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797002 (Womens Casual Tank Top) is clearly exiting its summer peak season. The current date is August 26, 2019. Demand has dropped significantly from the July plateau (~200+ units) to an average of ~72 units over the four most recent periods (P25-P28: 99, 79, 53, 59). In-transit inventory includes 264 units from P25, which is expected to arrive in Period 29 (this period). On-hand inventory is already high at 868 units. Combined, the pipeline and on-hand inventory (868 + 264 = 1132) far exceed the projected demand for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods * ~70 units = 350 units). To avoid increasing holding costs for a seasonal item in decline, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the recent 4-week downshift and keep sigma_hat focused on recent volatility (N=4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed late August 2019: 4-period average (P25-P28) dropped to 72.5 units/week as summer season concludes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lacy tank top, which is highly seasonal. As of Period 30 (September 2, 2019), demand has clearly entered its post-summer trough. The last five periods (P25-P29) show demand values of 99, 79, 53, 59, and 83, reflecting a significant downshift from the July peak. The 5-period average is now 74.6 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently very high (1,049 units) because of orders placed during the higher-demand July regime arriving now. Given that the current inventory covers over 14 weeks of current demand (1049 / 74.6 \u2248 14), and holding costs are $1/unit while profit is $19/unit, the priority is to avoid further accumulation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized low-demand regime of late August/early September and sigma_hat with recent_N=5 to account for the reduced volatility in this off-season period. The OR backend will likely recommend zero orders given the high inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed for September: average demand settled at 74.6 units/week (P25-P29) as summer seasonality ends.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797002 (Essential Tanktop) has transitioned out of its summer peak. Demand in September (Periods 25-30) has stabilized at a significantly lower level, with a 6-period average of 74.6 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 974 units, which is extremely high relative to the current demand regime (~13 weeks of stock at current rates). With a lead time of 4 periods, we are looking at a required base stock (covering (L+1) or 5 periods) of roughly 375-450 units. Since on-hand (974) already vastly exceeds this and there is no evidence of a forthcoming autumn spike for this 'jersey fancy' tank top, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods to reflect the post-summer floor. No new orders will be triggered by the OR backend because the pipeline stock exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Essential Tanktop (SKU 572797002) has entered a stable post-summer regime. Since Period 25 (August), demand has consistently remained below 100 units, with a 7-period average (P25-P31) of approximately 74.6 units. Current on-hand inventory is 900 units, which is extremely high (covering over 10 periods of the current demand rate). There are no units in-transit. Given the high holding cost relative to the current low demand environment and the excessive stock on hand, the goal is to stop ordering and allow inventory to bleed down. I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand state (approx. 75 units/period), and setting L to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently returned 4 periods when deliveries occur. This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than the current inventory, preventing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime confirmed for September 2019: Mean demand has stabilized at ~75 units/week (P25-P31), representing a significant drop from the summer peak of ~200+ units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Essential Tanktop Lace TVP' has stabilized into a post-summer regime. Since Period 25 (August), demand has consistently remained low, with the last 8 periods (P25-P32) averaging 74 units. The most recent 3 periods (P30-P32) show even tighter stability at 73 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 830 units and no units in transit, the current stock covers over 11 weeks of the current demand regime (830 / 74). Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $19.0, the target service level is high (95%), but the massive overstocking from previous summer periods means no new orders should be placed until inventory levels normalize. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the stable post-summer mean (approx 74 units) and allow the OR engine's capped policy to naturally zero out orders while inventory is excess.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Essential Tanktop Lace TVP' has clearly transitioned into a stable post-summer regime. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P25-P33), the demand has averaged approximately 76.6 units per week, significantly lower than the July summer peak of 200+. Specifically, the most recent 5-period demand (P29-P33) shows absolute stability with values [83, 75, 74, 70, 99], averaging 80.2 units. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 731 units with 0 units in-transit. Given a promised lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, the inventory needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. 5 * 80.2 = 401 units. Since current on-hand (731) is significantly higher than the required base stock (~400-500 depending on safety stock), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the stable post-summer mean (~77) which informs the OR engine's ceiling, while keeping L at default as shipping remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. Demand for the 'Essential Tanktop Lace' has significantly cooled following the conclusion of the summer season. Since Period 25 (late July/early August), demand has stabilized at a much lower regime. The 10-period average (P25-P34) is 72.5 units/week. Specifically, the most recent 4 periods (P31-P34) show a mean of 69.5 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 696 units, which is extremely high given the current demand regime. With a mean demand of ~70 units and a lead time of 4 periods, a safe base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) would be around 350-450 units. Since 696 > 450, no new orders are needed. The OR parameters are set to reflect this lower stabilization: L is held at 4 (stable history), mu_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the post-summer mean (~72.5 * 5 = 362.5), and sigma_hat is calculated on the same window to account for recent lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime stabilized further in September/October: 10-period average (P25-P34) is 72.5 units/week, down from the peak summer average of ~200+ units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797002 (Essential Tanktop) has transitioned out of its summer peak and is now in a stable post-summer regime. The demand for the last 11 periods (P25-P35) has averaged 71.7 units/week, drastically lower than the summer peak of ~200 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 632 units with 0 units in-transit. Given a demand of ~72 units/week and a lead time of 4 periods, your current inventory covers nearly 9 weeks of demand. To avoid additional holding costs, no new orders should be placed until inventory levels align with the current demand regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=11 to reflect this lower, stable demand level. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797002 (Women's Tank Top) is currently in a post-summer demand regime. Since Period 25, demand has significantly downshifted from the summer peak (~200+ units) to a stable autumn baseline. The average demand across the last 12 periods (P25-P36) is approximately 70.8 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 573 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, the coverage required for the L+1 window (5 periods) at the current mean is approximately 354 units. Our current inventory of 573 is significantly above this target, resulting in high holding costs. No new orders have been placed since Period 25 to allow the excess inventory to bleed off. For Period 37, I will continue to signal zero orders by setting parameters that reflect the current lower demand regime. I use recent_N=12 to capture the post-summer mean (~71) and variance, ensuring the OR engine calculates a base stock level lower than our current on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product (women's lace tank top) is in a post-summer demand regime. Since Period 25 (August), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the summer peak. The average demand over the last 13 periods (P25-P37) is approximately 74 units. Specifically, for the last 5 periods (P33-P37), demand has been [99, 35, 64, 59, 62], averaging 63.8 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 511 units with 0 in-transit. Given a promised lead time of 4 periods and a desired coverage of 5 periods (L+1), the target stock level should be around 320-370 units. My current inventory (511) is already well above this requirement. Therefore, I will continue to signal zero orders by setting parameters that reflect the current low-demand regime. I'm using N=13 to capture the entire post-summer stable period for mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a robust yet accurate baseline for the current season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's tank top, which is entering its seasonal off-peak during the November period. Current on-hand inventory is 458 units, which is significantly high relative to the current demand regime. Over the last 10 periods (P29-P38), demand has averaged 67.4 units per week, with recent weeks (P34-P38) showing even lower movement (average 54.6). At the current rate, the 458 units on hand will cover approximately 7-8 weeks of demand, extending well past the 4-period lead time. No new orders have been placed since Period 25, which is correct given the inventory surplus. I will maintain mu_hat based on the last 10 periods to reflect the stable post-summer regime, while L remains at the default of 4 periods. The goal remains to bleed off excess inventory to minimize holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's tank top with lace trims (seasonal item). We are currently in mid-November (Period 40), and demand has consistently downshifted following the summer peak. The current post-summer regime (since Period 25) shows a significant decrease in volume. Looking at the last 15 periods (P25-P39), demand has averaged approximately 68 units/week, with the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) showing a further decline to 52.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is 432 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and a review period of 1, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. At the current average of ~53-68 units, our current inventory of 432 units covers approximately 6-8 weeks of demand. Since the target service level is high (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), but we already have excess stock relative to the declining late-autumn demand, I will use a 'recent_N' approach (N=15) to capture the post-summer mean while setting parameters that prevent unnecessary ordering. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift for autumn/winter confirmed: Mean demand from P35-P39 dropped to 52.8 units/week, continuing the decline from the Sep/Oct average of ~72 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for the 'Essential Tanktop Lace' has significantly dropped as we enter the late autumn/winter season. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P35-P40) is 50.6 units/week, confirming a downshift from the September/October average of ~72. Given the high on-hand inventory (382 units), which covers approximately 7-8 weeks of current demand, and the 4-period lead time, no new orders are necessary. The OR backend will naturally suppress ordering because on-hand exceeds the required base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, and 'default' for lead time as it has remained stable at 4 periods throughout the history.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, and the SKU is a women's lace tank top. Demand has entered a stable low-volume autumn/winter regime. The 5-period average (P37-P41) is approximately 46.2 units/week, significantly lower than the previous summer and spring peaks. On-hand inventory is currently 342 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we must consider the inventory needed to cover 5 periods (L+1). At the current demand rate of ~46 units/week, 5 periods of demand would be roughly 230 units. Since 342 > 230, no new orders are required. The priority is to avoid accumulating more holding costs as we head into the end of the year. I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) for demand to capture the late autumn decline, and maintain the stable lead time of 4. This will likely result in the OR backend generating a zero order, allowing the excess stock to bleed off.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift for winter established: Mid-October through late November demand (P37-P41) has averaged 46.2 units/week, a further ~12% decline from the early autumn average (~52.8).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the tank top SKU (572797002) showed a significant jump in Period 42 (Nov 25) to 125 units, which is a notable departure from the winter average of ~46 units. This spike likely corresponds to 'Black Friday' (Nov 29, 2019) or early December holiday shopping. Historical data from early 2019 shows a base demand around 80-100 units before the spring ramp-up. We currently have 217 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With a 4-period lead time, we must cover demand for Periods 43-47. If the Period 42 spike is temporary (Black Friday), demand may return to the ~50-80 unit range. However, we must be cautious not to over-order given we are approaching the end of the year (Period 47). I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the winter baseline while acknowledging the recent spike, and utilize the 'calculate' method for lead time as history consistently shows a 4-period delivery cycle. This maintains sufficient buffer for the remaining periods without excessive holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand reached 125 units (Black Friday 2019), up significantly from the Nov average of ~46.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday period and approaching the end of the year. Demand for this fitted cotton tank top has historically shown a significant spike during Black Friday (Period 42: 125 units), followed by a return to winter baseline levels (Period 43: 31 units). The autumn/winter baseline average (P37-P41, P43) is approximately 43.7 units/week. However, we must account for potential remaining holiday demand or pre-Christmas activity, though as a summer item, winter demand is generally low. On-hand inventory is 186 units with 123 units in transit (ordered P43, expected P47). Pipeline inventory is 309 units. With a lead time of 4 periods and a service level target of ~95% (Profit $19 / Holding $1), we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using an explicit mu_hat based on the winter baseline (43.7 * 5 \u2248 218) plus a safety buffer for volatility, the current 309 units are sufficient to cover the remaining periods of the game (ending at P47). Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no aggressive ordering occurs while maintaining a safe stock level through the winter trough.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 (Black Friday) demand reached 125 units, followed by a return to a winter baseline of ~31-40 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019, following the Black Friday holiday spike (125 units in P42). Demand has since returned to a winter baseline of ~31-38 units (P43-P44). Given the product is a cotton lace tank top, demand is expected to remain low through the winter months before the spring recovery usually observed in February. The 3-period average (P42-P44) is skewed by the spike (64.6 units); however, excluding the spike, the recent winter demand (P39-P44 excluding P42) is approximately 37 units/week. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the post-holiday stabilization while accounting for enough volume to prevent stockouts if small fluctuations occur. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods throughout the history. On-hand (148) and In-transit (219) are sufficient, so the OR backend will likely temper new orders while maintaining the base stock level.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797002 (Women's Cotton Tank Top) is currently in a stable winter demand regime. Following the Black Friday spike (P42: 125 units), demand has returned to a consistent baseline. The last three periods (P43-P45) show demand of 31, 38, and 42 units respectively, averaging approximately 37 units/week. As we are in late December (P46), I expect demand to remain low until the spring ramp-up begins in February. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 106 and in-transit at 278 (Total Pipeline: 384), we are well-covered for the next 5 periods (~5 x 37 = 185 units). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current post-holiday baseline, and keep L at default (4). The OR backend will use these to maintain the current base stock policy while accounting for the significant pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-holiday: Dec 2019 average is 37 units/week (P43-P45), establishing the mid-winter baseline for tank tops.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lace tank top has stabilized in a mid-winter low following the Black Friday spike. The current demand regime (P43-P46) shows a consistent average of 37.25 units per week. With high on-hand inventory (68) and significant units in transit (278), the current stock position (346 units) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand throughout the lead time plus review period (target \u2248 5 * 37 = 185 units). The backend OR engine should use the most recent demand data (N=4) to avoid over-ordering based on the older autumn or holiday levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods according to historical conclusions.
