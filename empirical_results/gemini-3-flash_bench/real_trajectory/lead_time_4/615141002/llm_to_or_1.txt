Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Womens Everyday Collection' jersey top. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the first period, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. Historical demand data shows 5 samples (99, 85, 106, 148, 135) with a mean of 114.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 26.5. There is a slight upward trend in the last two samples (148 and 135) compared to the start of January, likely reflecting early spring collection demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=5 to capture this recent behavior while providing enough data for a stable base stock. The lead time (L) is set to 'default' as we have no observed lead time data yet to contradict the promised 4 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 158 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (they should arrive in Period 5). Consequently, demand of 79 in Period 1 was lost due to zero on-hand inventory. Looking at the historical demand samples (99, 85, 106, 148, 135) and the Period 1 demand (79), there's a slight downward trend or stabilization following a peak in late January. The average of the last 6 samples (including P1) is approximately 108.6. Given the product is a 'Long-sleeved, fitted top' and we are in mid-February, we are still in the seasonal window for this item, though demand may start to taper as spring approaches. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most relevant demand mean and volatility while waiting for the initial pipeline to arrive.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical demand for this 'Jersey Fancy' top has been relatively stable, with samples from Jan-Feb ranging from 85 to 148, and recent observed demand in Period 1 (79) and Period 2 (84). No inventory has arrived yet as the promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the Period 1 order (158 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4). Currently, there are 312 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since demand is fairly consistent with the early February levels but slightly lower in the last two weeks, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture the current trend (averaging the last few historical samples and the two most recent observations). Lead time is set to default (4) as we have seen no evidence to contradict the promised lead time yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product (Womens Everyday Collection Jersey Fancy Top) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we are in Period 4, the first order placed in Period 1 (158 units) is scheduled to arrive DURING this period (at the arrival resolution phase) and will be visible in the Period 4 conclude message (available at Period 5). Consequently, the current on-hand inventory is 0 and sales have been 0 since start. The historical demand samples (99, 85, 106, 148, 135) and observed demand in the game (79, 84, 71) show a mean around 101 units per week. There is no evidence yet to suggest the lead time is anything other than the promised 4 periods. To maintain a base stock level that covers demand for (L+1) = 5 periods, I will use recent_N for mu_hat based on the game's actual demand observations and the last few pre-game samples to capture the current trend. N=5 is chosen to balance the recent lower game observations with the higher pre-game samples. Sigma will be kept at default to handle volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a women's long-sleeved fitted top. Historical demand was steady (avg ~100) until Period 4, where demand spiked to 509. This 2019/3/4 spike likely represents a seasonal surge (early Spring collection launch or pre-holiday shopping). Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (2019/2/11) should arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (available at Period 6 start). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and all previous 4 orders (totaling 569 units) are in-transit. Because of the massive demand jump in Period 4, the default mu_hat (average of all samples) will significantly underestimate the needed base stock for a sustained high-demand regime. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the upward trend and the recent spike, providing a more responsive forecast to the OR backend.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top. Historical demand was stable around 80-100 units initially but surged dramatically starting Period 4 (March 4th), likely due to seasonal transition or a collection launch. Period 4 demand was 509 and Period 5 was 595. The average of these two recent high-demand periods is ~552. Promised lead time is 4 periods, and the Period 1 order arrived exactly on time in Period 5 (L=4). However, current on-hand represents a stockout (0 units) because demand far exceeded the early arrival. We have 1043 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). To capture the new demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since L=4, the backend will calculate base stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the current regime average of ~552, mu_hat will be approx 2760, which is necessary to cover the observed high-velocity demand and recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 4 (2019-03-04): Demand increased from ~85 to ~550 (+540%), coinciding with March seasonality. Lead time confirmed at 4 periods based on P1 arrival.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand history shows a clear regime shift: Periods 1-3 averaged ~78, while Periods 4-6 jumped to an average of ~459 units (509, 595, 274). Although Period 6 demand (274) was lower than the previous two weeks, it remains significantly higher than the initial baseline, suggesting a sustained spring seasonal peak for this garment item. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1542 units in transit. Our arrivals from P1 and P2 both confirmed the promised lead time (L=4). To ensure the OR backend captures the higher demand level rather than the lifetime average, I am setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will focus the forecast on the high-demand regime that began in Period 4. Using the promised lead time (L=4) remains appropriate.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). Previous data showed a massive demand spike in Period 4 and 5 (509, 595), followed by a cooling down in Periods 6 and 7 (274, 86). The 'Carry-over Insight' noted an increase, but recent data suggests high volatility rather than a sustained 500+ mean. Specifically, the drop from 595 to 86 indicates the 'March spike' may be tapering off or highly erratic. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (observed in P5, P6, P7). On-hand inventory is 75, with 2114 in-transit (orders from P4-P7). Since demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (avg ~180), and the spike looks transient, using a longer history for the mean is safer than just the spike periods to avoid massive over-ordering while still accounting for the higher volume compared to Feb. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the shift from the spike to the current cooling trend (P4-P7 demand: 509, 595, 274, 86; mean ~366).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: March spike peaked at ~550 but dropped to 86 by end of month. Mean demand regime now estimated at ~366 across the last 4 periods (P4-P7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). History shows a major demand spike in early March (P4: 509, P5: 595) that has since subsided (P7: 86, P8: 112). The garment is a 'Long-sleeved, fitted top', suggesting spring/autumn utility, but the March surge likely represented a spring collection launch peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P1-P4 orders). Currently, we have 59 units on-hand and 2,094 in-transit (mostly from the large orders placed during the high-demand periods P5-P7). Because demand has stabilized at a lower level following the peak, using the recent 4 periods (P5-P8) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a safer estimate (~266 per period) than the long-term average, while still accounting for the trailing edge of the spike. This helps prevent over-ordering as the large pipeline starts arriving.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Following the March surge (avg ~550), demand for P7-P8 has averaged ~99, indicating the initial seasonal launch spike has concluded.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The data shows a massive demand surge in March (Periods 4 and 5) that has since subsided to a stable level. For the last three periods (P7-P9), demand has been 86, 112, and 81, averaging 93 units. This suggests the product has exited its peak seasonal period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 610 units, and there is a massive pipeline of 1462 units (ordered during the peak period in P6 and P7). Given the current demand (approx. 93/week) and the total system inventory (2072 units), we have over 22 weeks of stock, which significantly exceeds the target level. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the post-peak stabilization (avg ~93) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the lower current volatility, allowing the OR backend to restrict further ordering until the excess inventory is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: Demand regime for April (P7-P9) has settled into a lower range (mean ~93, std ~16) compared to the March surge.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-22. We are in a post-peak demand regime for this jersey top following a significant seasonal surge in March (Periods 4-6). Demand has stabilized at a much lower level over the last four periods (P7-P10: 86, 112, 81, 47), averaging 81.5 units per period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. We currently have a substantial inventory surplus: 1216 units on-hand and 809 units in-transit (ordered P7: 733 units; P8: 76 units). Given the current demand average (~82), our current total inventory cover (2025 units) is approximately 24 periods, far exceeding the L+1 requirement (5 periods). The OR backend will naturally scale back orders with these parameters, but setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent stable regime ensures the base stock calculation isn't inflated by the March spike.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical data and recent demand signals indicate that the 'Juanos' jersey top experienced a massive seasonal demand spike in March (peaking at ~500-600 units) which has now fully subsided. April demand has been significantly lower and declining: 112, 81, 47, and 30 units respectively. We are currently in a state of extreme overstock (on-hand inventory: 1919 units) due to large orders placed during the March peak (Periods 5-7) arriving now. With demand dropping to 30 units and holding costs at $1/unit, the priority is to stop all ordering and allow the system to bleed off the excess inventory. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the recent low-demand regime (last 4 periods avg ~67) and the lead time (L) at the confirmed 4 periods. The high on-hand + lead time calculation will result in zero orders being placed by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression continues post-March spike: April demand averaged ~67 units/week, with the most recent period dropping to 30 units, suggesting the end of the spring seasonal peak for this item.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '615141002' (Women's Jersey Top) has completed its major seasonal surge that occurred in March and April. Demand has significantly decelerated, reflecting post-peak seasonality; the last four periods (P9-P12) averaged only 51.5 units/week, down from the peak of 500+. On-hand inventory is currently 1,947 units with zero in-transit, providing a massive buffer that covers over 30 weeks of supply at current demand levels. No new orders should be placed. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P5-P12). To prevent the OR backend from ordering more units despite the high inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4-week window (N=4) to capture the sharp decline in demand while ensuring L respects the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (May) confirmed: demand has stabilized at a much lower level (avg ~52 units/week) following the March/April surge.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). Following the significant seasonal surge in March (demand peaked at ~500+), the demand for this long-sleeved jersey top has stabilized at a much lower level. Over the last 4 periods (P10-P13), demand has averaged 40 units/week (47, 30, 48, 35) with low volatility. Currently, the SKU has 1,912 units on-hand and zero units in-transit. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the new demand regime (approx. 47 weeks of stock), no additional ordering is required. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders due to the historical high-demand samples from March, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the 'post-peak' stabilization regime. Lead time (L) remains at the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019-05-20), the item continues its post-seasonal decline. Demand for the last four periods (P11-P14) has been extremely low and stable (30, 48, 35, 43), averaging approximately 39 units per week. The massive orders placed during the March seasonal peak (P5-P7) have all arrived, resulting in an on-hand inventory of 1,869 units. Given the current average demand of 39 units/week, the current stock is sufficient for over 45 weeks of sales, far exceeding any reasonable base stock level. There is no need for additional orders. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary 'top-up' orders while inventory is slowly drawn down, I will use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the contemporary low-demand regime and maintain the lead time at the confirmed 4 periods. The goal is to minimize holding costs by ordering nothing until this surplus is cleared.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1604.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' jersey top. It experienced a major demand spike in March (up to ~595 units), which has since collapsed as we entered May. Over the last four periods (P12-P15), demand has stabilized at a low level, averaging approximately 45 units per week (48, 35, 43, 53). Currently, the inventory on-hand is extremely high at 1,816 units, which is enough to cover approximately 40 weeks of demand at the current rate. Because the holding cost is $1.0/unit and the profit is $4.0/unit, the high inventory levels are significant. No further orders are needed. The OR backend needs parameters that reflect the current low-demand stability to avoid any automated ordering despite the high service level requirements. I will use a recent_N (N=4) to capture this post-peak stabilization.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1636.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the demand for this jersey top has settled into a low-volume stability phase following the significant March seasonal spike. Over the last four weeks (Period 13-16), demand has averaged approximately 41.75 units per week (35, 43, 53, 36). The current on-hand inventory of 1,780 units is extremely high, covering over 40 weeks of demand at the current rate. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 vs $4.0) and the massive inventory surplus, the OR backend's natural behavior will be to order 0 units, which is appropriate. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current post-spike demand regime, which will ensure the base stock calculation is grounded in current reality, even though no new orders will be triggered for many periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for June (Summer) confirmed stable at low levels (avg ~42 units/week) following the end of the Spring peak.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for item 615141002 (Women's Top) has stabilized at a summer low following a high seasonal peak in March and April. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has averaged 38.8 units per week (35, 43, 53, 36, 27). The item currently has an extremely high on-hand inventory of 1,753 units with zero units in-transit. This stock represents over 45 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. My objective is to prevent further inventory accumulation while waiting for on-hand stock to deplete. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stable low-demand regime, and stick with the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. This will result in an order of 0 units because current system stock far exceed the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1618.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved ribbed top, which saw a significant seasonal spike in March (P4-P6) followed by a sharp decline. Demand has now stabilized at a low summer regime. Over the most recent 5 periods (P14-P18), the mean demand is 37.2 units/week with a standard deviation of approximately 10 units. The current on-hand inventory of 1726 units is extremely high (estimated 40+ weeks of supply) relative to the current demand regime. No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this stable low-demand regime, and L remains at the calculated/promised lead time of 4. High holding costs ($1/unit/period) make inventory reduction a priority, so parameters are set to avoid triggering new orders while inventory remains in excess.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Juanos Jersey Top) has stabilized at a very low level after the significant March/April spring peak. Recent demand (P17-P19) has averaged approximately 29 units per week, significantly lower than the historical samples and earlier peaks. On-hand inventory is extremely high (1,693 units), while the weekly holding cost is $1.0 per unit against a profit of $4.0. We have enough stock to satisfy current demand levels for over 50 periods. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the excessive stock level, the priority is to avoid ordering any additional units until inventory aligns with the current low demand regime. I will use the 'recent_N' method (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stabilized summer demand of ~30 units/week, which will result in the OR backend's base_stock being much lower than the current inventory, ensuring zero orders are placed.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 615141002 (Jersey Fancy top) has stabilized at low summer levels, averaging approximately 25 units per week over the last four periods (Periods 17-20). The inventory position is extremely heavy, with 1,680 units on hand, which is enough to cover over a year of demand at current rates. This overstock resulted from large orders placed during the March seasonal surge (P5-P7) that arrived while demand was rapidly declining in April. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to profit ($4.0/unit) and the excessive on-hand inventory, the objective is to prevent any additional ordering until inventory levels are naturally depleted through sales. I am setting parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime: L remains at the confirmed 4 periods, mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using the most recent 4 periods to capture the current stable summer demand state (avg ~25). The OR backend's capped policy will ensure zero units are ordered because on-hand inventory far exceeds any reasonable base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (July) confirmed stable at very low levels, averaging ~25 units/week (Periods 17-20). This follows the spring peak and subsequent decline in May/June.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a very low-demand summer phase (avg ~25 units/week since Period 17). Current on-hand inventory is 1,660 units, which is extremely high (covering over 60 weeks of current demand) due to over-ordering during the March seasonal peak. No new shipments have been ordered since Period 8, and none are in transit. The primary objective is to stop ordering and allow the current inventory to deplete, as the holding cost ($1.00) relative to the profit margin ($4.00) makes excess inventory moderately expensive. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 periods and demand parameters based on the most recent 5 periods (Periods 17-21) to ensure the OR backend recognizes the low demand state. With such a massive inventory surplus, the backend policy will result in zero orders, which is intended.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1490.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a very low-demand summer phase (Period 22, July 2019). The current on-hand inventory of 1626 units is massive compared to the recent average demand of ~25 units per week. This inventory was built up during orders placed in Periods 5-7 to catch a spring peak that subsided faster than anticipated. Since the holding cost is $1.0/unit and profit is $4.0/unit, we are heavily overstocked and will naturally avoid ordering for many periods. My goal is to set parameters that represent the current low-demand stability (June/July) without triggering the OR backend to order. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (the most stable recent window) and keep lead time at 'calculate' as it has consistently been 4 periods. The excessive inventory ensures a maximum service level while we bleed off stock; the focus is minimizing further procurement until inventory aligns with the new demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (Womens Top) continues to exhibit a steady, low-demand regime in July (Summer), averaging 23.5 units over the last 4 periods (P20-P23) and 25 units over the last 7 periods (P17-P23). Current on-hand inventory is 1,599 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (~60+ periods of coverage). No new orders have been placed since Period 8 due to this massive surplus generated by the March peak orders. The priority remains to liquidate current stock rather than ordering more. I will continue to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the contemporary low-demand environment, while keeping Lead Time at default (4). The backend will automatically result in an order of 0 because on-hand inventory + pipeline (1599) vastly exceeds the required base stock (~25 units/week * 5 weeks).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which experienced a significant demand spike in March (Period 4-6) but has since stabilized at a much lower 'Summer' regime. Over the last 4 periods (P21-P24), demand has averaged 25.5 units per week (20, 34, 27, 21), which is consistent with the 'July' regime noted in previous insights. Current on-hand inventory is 1,578 units with zero units in transit. Given the current low demand, this inventory level will last for approximately 60 weeks, far exceeding the projected demand for the remainder of the simulation. No new orders should be placed. I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=4) to reflect the current low-demand environment, ensuring the OR backend's calculated base stock remains significantly below the enormous current on-hand inventory, thus preventing any new orders from being triggered.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019 (Period 26). The item is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' jersey top, which experienced a significant demand spike in March (Period 4-6) but has since entered a low-demand regime throughout the summer. Over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), demand has averaged 28.8 units/week (20, 34, 27, 21, 42). Pipeline inventory is empty, but on-hand inventory is extremely high at 1,536 units, which is approximately 53 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. Consequently, no new orders should be placed until this surplus is cleared. I am setting L to 'calculate' based on consistent historical delivery of 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current stable low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend's target base stock remains significantly below the current on-hand level to prevent unnecessary ordering and minimize further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand regime (August) remains stable at low levels (~29 units/week), consistent with the July trend. Significant inventory surplus (1500+ units) exists following the over-ordering during the March seasonal peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' jersey top. Following a massive demand spike in March (Period 4-6), demand has settled into a very low and stable summer regime. Over the last 10 periods (since Period 17), demand has averaged approximately 27.4 units per week with low volatility. Currently, there is a massive inventory surplus of 1499 units on-hand with zero units in-transit. Given that the holding cost is $1.0/unit and the profit is $4.0/unit, the massive overstock is significantly hurting the total reward due to high holding costs. No orders should be placed until the on-hand inventory is depleted, which at current demand rates, will take approximately 50+ periods (well beyond the game end at Period 47). I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (mu_hat based on the last 10 periods) and use the default lead time. The OR backend will see the high on-hand inventory against a low base stock requirement and correctly place zero orders.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, late summer. Demand for this Jersey Fancy long-sleeved top has stabilized at a low level since the conclusion of the spring peak in March/April. Over the last 4 periods (P24-P27), demand averaged approximately 37.75 units. The primary concern remains the massive on-hand inventory of 1,448 units, which originated from over-ordering during the unexpected March surge. At the current demand rate, this inventory represents over 30 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to reflect the current low-demand regime for both mean and volatility, while keeping lead time at the promised 4 periods. The goal is to maximize profit by selling through existing stock and minimizing additional holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The SKU 615141002 (Womens Jersey Top) is currently in a stable, low-demand phase following its significant peak in March. Over the last 8 periods (Periods 21-28), demand has averaged approximately 31.5 units per week, with low volatility. However, the inventory position remains critically high at 1,422 units on-hand, which is significantly above the required base stock for this demand level (roughly enough to cover 45 weeks of current demand). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to profit ($4.0/unit), the priority is to avoid any new orders while the surplus is liquidated. I will set the parameters to reflect the most recent demand regime (last 8 periods) to ensure the OR backend's calculated base stock is far below the current on-hand inventory, effectively suppressing new orders.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. The SKU (Women's Jersey Fancy Top) is in a post-peak seasonal slump, with demand stabilizing at a low level (average ~35 units/week) since May. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,377 units due to large orders placed during the March seasonal spike. With a holding cost of $1.0 vs. $4.0 profit and zero incoming pipeline, the focus remains on depleting this surplus before any new orders are placed. Demand for the last 4 periods (P26-P29) has been 37, 51, 26, 45, averaging ~40. I will continue to use recent_N to reflect this stable, low-demand regime. We do not need to order; setting parameters that result in a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand inventory ensures the OR backend will not place an order.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (Late Summer/Early Autumn) continues the stable low-demand pattern seen since June, averaging ~40 units per week (Periods 26-29: 37, 51, 26, 45).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand remains stable in the low-demand regime established during the summer, with the most recent four periods (P27-P30) averaging 43 units per week. Although there's a slight uptick from July/August levels (moving from ~30s into the 40s/50s), on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,327 units. This surplus resulted from heavy ordering during the March seasonal peak. At current demand levels, there is over 30 periods of stock on hand, while the promised lead time is only 4 periods. No new orders are needed. I will maintain the current parameters using a recent window (N=5) to reflect the stabilized late-summer/early-autumn demand while letting the inventory bleed down naturally. The OR backend will continue to output zero orders due to the high inventory levels compared to the base stock targets calculated from these parameters.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has shown a slight upward trend in the last two periods (50 and 76 units), compared to the late-summer average of ~40. This may indicate an early autumn shift for this 'Long-sleeved, fitted top', though it remains far below the March peak. The primary constraint remains the massive inventory surplus of 1,251 units (On-hand), which is sufficient to cover over 20 periods of current demand levels. No new orders are needed. I will maintain the current parameters to allow the system to bleed off the excess stock while keeping lead time at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by historical arrivals). N is set to 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent stable-to-slightly-rising demand window (Periods 24-31).

Carry-over insight: September demand (Periods 29-31) shows a slight increase from ~40 to ~60 units/week, potentially indicating the start of a minor autumn seasonal uptick for long-sleeved items.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23 (Period 33). The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which follows a seasonal pattern. We are observing the start of an autumn uptick; demand for the last three periods (P30-P32) has risen to 50, 76, and 75, averaging ~67 units/week compared to the summer average of ~30. However, on-hand inventory is extremely high (1,176 units) due to over-ordering during the massive March seasonal spike. With a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, minimizing ending inventory is crucial. Since the current on-hand inventory covers approximately 17 weeks of demand at the current rate (1176 / 67 \u2248 17.5), and the remaining game length is 15 periods, no new orders should be placed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the current autumn trend, while keeping L at the confirmed 4 periods. The massive inventory surplus will naturally prevent the OR backend from ordering.

Carry-over insight: Autumn uptick confirmed: Demand transitioned from a summer low (~30/week) to an autumn average of ~67/week starting Period 30 (2019-09-02).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. We are observing the SKU 'Juanos', a 'long-sleeved ribbed jersey' top. As noted in the carry-over insights, demand has significantly increased as we transitioned into Autumn. The most recent demand (Period 33) spiked to 186 units, confirming a sharp upward seasonal trend for long-sleeved items. However, the inventory on-hand is extremely high (990 units) due to massive over-ordering during the March seasonal peak. With a lead time of 4 periods, total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 990. Even with the recent spike, our stock is more than sufficient to cover immediate and upcoming demand (e.g., if demand remains at ~186, 990 units covers ~5 periods). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the active Autumn uptick (avg ~97/week), while the OR backend's inventory check (base_stock - on_hand) will correctly result in a zero order given the surplus.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal spike accelerated: Period 33 demand reached 186 units, up from the ~50-70 range in early September. Cumulative autumn average (P30-P33) is now ~97 units/week.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in the middle of an autumn seasonal uptick for this 'long-sleeved ribbed jersey' top. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 186 and remained elevated at 108 in Period 34. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 99 units/week. However, on-hand inventory is currently very high at 882 units due to over-ordering during the previous spring peak. Given the lead time of 4 periods, total pipeline inventory needs to cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. Even at the elevated average of 99/week, we need approximately 495 units to cover the pipeline. Since current on-hand (882) is significantly higher than this requirement and there are only 12 periods remaining in the game, the priority remains to deplete existing stock to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while maintaining the service level. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to reflect the autumn uptick (avg ~99), but the OR engine's capped policy will result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal uptick sustained: Demand for Periods 30-34 averaged 99 units/week (50, 76, 75, 186, 108), confirming a significant increase from summer lows of ~30/week.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (Womens Long-sleeved top) is currently in an autumn seasonal uptick, with demand over the last 6 periods (P30-P35) averaging 94 units/week (50, 76, 75, 186, 108, 71). This is significantly higher than the summer average of ~30. However, the current on-hand inventory is 811 units, which covers more than 8 weeks of demand at the current elevated rate (811 / 94 \u2248 8.6 weeks). Since the lead time is 4 periods and the holding cost is $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0, maintaining an excessively high inventory during the descent from the autumn peak would be costly. The backend OR logic will naturally order zero because on-hand (811) far exceeds the base stock target calculated from mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime (N=6) to ensure the target inventory level is realistic, but given the current surplus, no new orders are expected or needed.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (September-October) confirmed: Average demand of 94 units/week over P30-P35, with a distinct peak of 186 in late September.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 21, 2019. We are in an autumn demand regime for this long-sleeved jersey top. Since Period 30 (September), demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to the summer lows, averaging 94 units/week over the last 6 periods (P30-P35). Period 36 demand was 90 units, consistent with this average. Current on-hand inventory is 721 units with no units in transit. Given the average demand of ~94 units/week and a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods, which is approximately 470 units. With 721 units on hand, we still have a significant surplus and do not need to place new orders. The OR backend will naturally result in zero orders given the high on-hand inventory relative to the base stock calculation $(\mu \approx 94 \times 5 = 470)$. I will use 'recent_N' for $\hat{\mu}$ with $N=7$ to capture the full autumn regime including the initial uptick.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 28th. Demand for this long-sleeved ribbed top remains in an elevated 'autumn' regime compared to the summer lows, with the last two weeks showing demand of 90 and 105 units. Over the last 8 periods (since September 2nd), the average demand has been approximately 95 units per week. I have 616 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With an average demand of ~95, my current inventory covers approximately 6.5 periods. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, my total coverage (demand for L+1 periods) needs to be around 475 units. I currently have a surplus of approximately 140 units relative to that target. However, because the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy and my on-hand inventory (616) is already higher than the calculated base-stock (based on current demand), the system will naturally order 0 units. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent autumn demand regime using an N=8 (since Period 30) to ensure the system recognizes the higher mean demand, even though it won't result in an order this period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand from Period 30 to 37 is 95 units/week (Sept-Oct), confirming a sustained increase from summer levels (~30/week).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04 (Period 39). Demand for the 'Juanos' long-sleeved top has stabilized into an Autumn regime following a late-September peak (P33). Over the last 9 periods (P30-P38), demand has averaged approximately 98 units/week. Most recent demand (P38) was 119, showing slight upward movement as we enter November. On-hand inventory is 497 units with no units in transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods and a service cycle of L+1=5 periods, 497 units covers roughly 5 weeks of demand at the current rate (98 * 5 = 490). We are near the edge of needing a new order, but given the significant holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00), minimizing excess ending inventory is crucial. I will use a recent_N approach (N=9, covering the Autumn regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized seasonality and volatility while ensuring the OR backend's capped policy prevents over-ordering if the on-hand is sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (Sept-Oct) confirmed: Average demand of 98 units/week over P30-P38 (50, 76, 75, 186, 108, 71, 90, 105, 119).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Demand has stabilized into an autumn regime following the September uptick. Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), demand has averaged 94 units/week (standard deviation ~41). Most recent demand was 60 units, showing some volatility. On-hand inventory is currently at 437 units, with 67 units in-transit (ordered P39). With a lead time of 4 periods, we are covering approximately 5 periods of demand (current + lead time). Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 504) covers roughly 5.3 weeks of average autumn demand (94 units/week). This is a safe level given we are in the middle of November. I will continue using the Autumn regime statistics (last 10 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). The product is a 'long-sleeved ribbed jersey top', which typically sees sustained demand during autumn and winter. Historical demand for the Autumn regime (Period 30 onwards) has averaged approximately 93 units/week (P30-P40), with a significant peak of 186 units in late September. Most recent demand (P39-P40) has stabilized at ~60 units. Current on-hand inventory is 376 units with 107 in-transit (ordered P39-P40, expected arrival P43-P44). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory covering approximately 4-6 weeks of current demand, I will continue to use a 'recent_N' approach (N=11, covering the start of the Autumn regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain a safe base stock as we enter the height of the winter season, while the backend's capped policy prevents over-ordering given the existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand regime (starting P30) remains stable with an average of ~93 units/week. Recent November demand (P39-P40) has slightly moderated to ~60 units/week.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (2019-11-25). Since the autumn uptick in September (Period 30), demand has stabilized at a higher level than summer, but recent weeks (P39-P41) have shown a consistent moderation to a mean of 62.33 units. This suggests the secondary autumn peak (which reached a high of 186 in late September) has leveled off into a consistent late-autumn/winter pace. Inventory on-hand (310) plus in-transit (152) equals 462 units. Given the lead time L=4 and our current demand estimate (62.3 units/week), this provides coverage for approximately 7.4 periods (462 / 62.3). The OR backend's inventory target (base stock) for L=4 is roughly 5 periods of demand. Since 7.4 > 5, the system is expected to place conservative orders or zero orders to gradually bleed off excess inventory and maintain high service levels during the winter transition. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the full autumn regime while acknowledging the recent stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Early Winter demand regime (starting P39) shows stabilization at ~62 units/week, a reduction from the Sept-Oct average of ~98 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 42 spiked to 231 units, significantly higher than the previous weeks' average of ~63. This is consistent with Black Friday / Cyber Monday seasonality (late November), representing a high-volume retail event. This spike has depleted on-hand inventory to 79 units. Given the in-transit pipeline of 205 units (ordered P39-P42) and the logic that current parameters must cover demand over L+1 periods, I will set mu_hat to reflect this seasonal volatility. While the spike was likely a single-week event, the lead time is 4 periods, meaning we must be prepared for potentially higher demand through December. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent regime change (incorporating the spike while acknowledging the baseline shift).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Late November seasonal demand spike detected (Period 42 demand = 231), likely related to Black Friday/Cyber Monday. This follows a period of stabilization at ~62 units/week.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Juanos' (long-sleeved, ribbed jersey top) is exhibiting expected seasonal movements for December.

With the holiday shopping season in full effect, we should anticipate a sustained higher baseline in December compared to early November. The order from Period 39 arrived exactly on time (L=4), confirming the supply chain is currently stable. Currently, we have 84 units on hand and 382 units in transit. Since the total periods are 47, we are approaching the end of the simulation. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P39-P43) which captures the shift from late autumn to early winter, including the holiday spike (average ~96 units/week). This balanced approach ensures we cover potential December volatility without over-ordering as we near the end of the game.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand baseline confirmed: Average demand for P39-P43 (including Black Friday spike) is ~96 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday period heading into the Christmas/New Year holiday. Demand in the most recent two periods (P43-P44) has dropped significantly (62 and 45 units) compared to the late November spike (231 units). This aligns with a typical retail 'lull' before the final Christmas surge. The carry-over insight from P44 estimates a December baseline around 96 units/week when including the spike, but the immediate trend is lower. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the mix of the recent spike and the subsequent drop, covering the transition from late November through December. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the arrivals of P39 and P40 orders in P43 and P44. Current on-hand is low (79), but in-transit (499) is sufficient to cover the next few weeks given the current lead time and softened demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand stabilization: After the P42 spike (231 units), demand has moderated to an average of ~54 units/week (P43-P44).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. We are in the post-holiday/end-of-year period for a long-sleeved jersey top. Historically, this SKU experienced a major spring peak in March (~500/week), a very low summer (~30/week), and a secondary autumn/winter peak (~100/week) with a specific Black Friday spike (231 units). Following the Black Friday/early December period, demand has moderated, averaging ~58 units/week over the last three periods (62, 45, 68). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the stabilized late-December demand level (~59 units/week) and account for the 5-period window (L+1). With 56 on-hand and 454 in-transit (orders from P42-P44 totaling 53+244+157=454), the pipeline is sufficient to cover the expected seasonal decline moving into January. I will use the default lead time (4) as arrivals are consistent.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization (December): Demand for the the jersey top has stabilized at approx 58 units/week (Periods 43-45) following the Black Friday spike of 231 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-30. We are in the post-holiday/end-of-year phase for a women's long-sleeved jersey top. Following the Black Friday spike (P42: 231 units), demand has stabilized at a lower level. Over the last four periods (P43-P46), demand has been 62, 45, 68, and 31 units, averaging 51.5 units per week. The inventory position shows On-hand = 78 and In-transit = 563 (which includes large orders from P43 and P44 arriving soon). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the product's seasonality (peaking in March), I expect demand to remain moderate through January before rising in late Q1. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the post-holiday stabilization (~52 units/week) and use default sigma_hat to account for historical volatility seen in late winter/early spring.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regime (Jan/Winter) stabilization: Demand for Periods 43-46 averaged 52 units/week following the Black Friday spike, indicating a return to moderate winter demand levels.
