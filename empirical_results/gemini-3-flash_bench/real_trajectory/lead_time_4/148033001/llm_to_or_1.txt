Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 148033001 is a pair of women's stay-up stockings (20 denier). The holding cost is very high relative to profit (1:1 ratio), which means the OR backend will target a low service level (q = 0.5) to avoid excess inventory. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 50 units/week with a standard deviation of ~8. Since there is no on-hand or in-transit inventory, we need to establish an initial pipeline. Given the high holding cost, I will use the default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to utilize all 5 historical samples to stabilize the initial forecast until we observe actual lead times and demand performance in this specific period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The item is 'Nouvelle 1p Stay Up' (20 denier leggings/tights). Historical demand is relatively stable (mean ~50). In Period 1, we ordered 65 units with a promised lead time (L) of 4. Since L=4, we don't expect arrivals until Period 5. The starting on-hand was 0 and demand was 58, resulting in 58 lost sales because the order hasn't arrived. I will set parameters to cover the (L+1) window. I'll use the average of all available historical samples (58, 42, 40, 50, 60, and now the observed 58 from P1) which is approximately 51.3. For mu_hat, (1+4)*51.3 = 256.5. For sigma_hat, the historical standard deviation is approx 8.3; sqrt(5)*8.3 \u2248 18.6. No significant regime shift is detected yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. The product is 'Nouvelle 1p Stay Up', a 20 denier legging/tights item. Recent demand (last 2 periods) is 58 and 70 (avg 64), which is slightly higher than the pre-game history (avg 50). Promised lead time is 4. Orders from Period 1 and 2 are in-transit (total 130). Current on-hand is 0, leading to stockouts because lead time ensures availability only after 4 periods. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N approach to capture the slight uptick in demand (using N=7 to include the 5 pre-game samples plus 2 game samples). For L and sigma_hat, I'll stick to defaults as we haven't observed any lead time arrivals yet to justify a change from the promised 4 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product (20 denier stay-ups) is a staple item. Initial on-hand inventory was 0, and since the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, we have not yet received any shipments. Orders from Period 1 (65 units), Period 2 (65 units), and Period 3 (72 units) are all in-transit, totaling 202 units. The first shipment is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Historical demand samples (58, 42, 40, 50, 60) and recent game history (58, 70, 42) show an average weekly demand of approximately 52.5 units with moderate variance. Since current on-hand is 0 and we are waiting for the lead time to resolve, I will use 'default' for L to align with the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent realized demand (58, 70, 42), which averages 56.7. This slightly more conservative estimate ensures we cover the pipeline risk during the initial stock-up phase, as the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is 20 denier stay-up tights. Historical demand (including samples provided) shows a mean of approximately 50.8 units per week (samples: 58, 42, 40, 50, 60; history: 58, 70, 42, 44). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible at the start of P6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 282 units in transit (P1: 65, P2: 65, P3: 72, P4: 80). Since we have not yet reached the promised lead time for the first order, we maintain the default lead time. mu_hat is set to the default (1+L)*mean_demand, where L=4, covering 5 weeks of demand. Given the current high stockout (on-hand=0), the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock level once arrivals commence.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Nouvelle 1p Stay Up' (leggings/tights). Historical demand (including pre-game samples) shows a mean of approximately 52 units per period (samples: 58, 42, 40, 50, 60; history: 58, 70, 42, 44, 69). The promised lead time is 4 periods. The 'Period 5 conclude' message confirms that the Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, verifying the actual lead time L=4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 217 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 2, 3, and 4). With L=4, we expect the Period 2 order (65 units) to arrive during Period 6, but it is not available for Period 6 demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 (spanning all available data points) to provide a stable forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the verified default lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. The product is 20 denier stay-up leggings. Historical demand (Seed + P1-P6) averages around 55 units. However, there is a clear demand spike starting in P6 (demand=100), which coincided with the middle of March. This might be due to a seasonal shift or event. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has consistently exceeded recent arrivals. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). We expect P3's order (72 units) to arrive during P7 resolution and P4's order (80 units) to arrive in P8. To address the recent demand surge and the stockouts, I am using recent_N for both demand mean and lead time, setting N to capture the recent regime. The OR backend needs to maintain a higher base stock to prevent further lost sales given the current $1 profit/$1 holding cost balance, which yields a target service level of 50%, though the engine's internal cap logic will protect against excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 6: Demand increased from a mean of ~50 to 100 (+100%). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is women's 20 denier stay-up tights. We observed a significant demand spike in Period 6 (100 units) which dropped back to 54 in Period 7. Historically, demand was around 50. The carry-over insight suggests a regime shift to ~100, but Period 7's demand (54) suggests that spike might have been a temporary outlier or higher volatility. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods across three consecutive arrivals (Periods 5, 6, and 7 reflecting orders from 1, 2, and 3). Currently, on-hand is low (18 units) with 234 in transit. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility (54 vs 100) and slightly higher demand levels compared to the very early weeks, while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/04/08), the SKU (Women's Leggings/Tights) shows a transition from a stable demand period towards potential volatility after a spike in Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 samples averaged ~50 units. Starting from Period 6, we saw 100, then 54, and 57. While Period 6 was a significant spike (100), the last two periods (54, 57) suggest demand might be settling near the initial mean or slightly higher, rather than sustaining the 100-unit level. However, to maintain a safe service level during this period of uncertainty, I will use a window of the last 4 periods (P5-P8) for demand forecasting (N=4), which captures both the spike and the recent moderation. Actual lead time is confirmed consistent at 4 periods (arrived as promised). Current on-hand is 41 with 267 in transit. The pipeline is healthy, but base stock parameters must account for the recent demand profile.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 (Women's Stay-Up Leggings) showed a significant demand spike at Period 6 (100 units), but demand in the last three periods (P7-P9) has averaged 47 units (54, 57, 30), suggesting the 'regime shift' at P6 may have been an outlier or short-lived peak rather than a sustained 100-unit average. Currently, on-hand inventory is 11, and we have 309 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). No order arrived in P9 because no order was placed in P5. The order placed in P6 (50 units) is expected to arrive during P10 (this period). Using recent_N for demand (N=4) captures the return to more moderate levels (~60 units/period) while accounting for the recent variability. With profit/holding cost ratio at 1:1, the target service level is 50%, so we aim to keep base stock around (L+1)*mean.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: The Period 6 demand spike (100) proved temporary; demand from Period 7-9 returned to a mean of ~47. Adjusting forecast to reflect a stabilized mean of ~50-60 rather than the previously flagged 100.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 11 (2019/4/22). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10). There was a significant demand spike in Period 6 (100 units), but demand from Period 7-10 has been much lower (54, 57, 30, 22), averaging ~41. The initial samples provided in the prompt (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) averaged 50. Given the recent downward trend over the last 4 weeks (avg 40.75), I am using N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this cooling demand. On-hand + In-transit is currently 298 units, which covers nearly 6-7 weeks of the recent average demand, suggesting we have sufficient stock for the lead time (L=4) plus current period (L+1=5). No orders were placed in P5 or P10 due to high base stock relative to pipeline, which is reasonable given high inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand has softened following the P6 spike: Period 7-10 average is ~41 units, which is lower than the initial baseline of 50. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a '20 denier stay-up', which is a staple item but can experience slight seasonal variation. Current inventory is high (On-hand: 107, In-transit: 155) relative to recent demand. Demand history shows a temporary spike in Period 6 (100 units), but the last five periods (Periods 7-11) have averaged approximately 39.8 units (54, 57, 30, 22, 36). The Period 11 demand was 36. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11). Given the current pipeline is significantly higher than the expected (L+1) demand (5 * 40 = 200 units), the OR backend will likely order 0. To ensure the forecast reflects the most recent stabilized demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the trend since the Period 6 anomaly subsided.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Stay Up' legging/tights product. Historical data shows a brief demand spike in Period 6 (100 units), which has since settled into a lower regime. Demand for the last 6 periods (P7-P12) has been 54, 57, 30, 22, 36, and 55, averaging approx 42.3 units per week. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, and P12). On-hand inventory is currently high (165 units) following large arrivals from orders placed during the brief demand spike. The in-transit inventory is 42 units (ordered Period 9, expected arrival Period 13 resolution). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), it is critical to keep inventory lean. I will set the lead time method to 'calculate' as it is stable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=6 to reflect the current post-spike demand regime (P7-P12), which provides a more accurate forecast than including the P6 outlier or the high pre-P1 data.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand regime (P7-P12) remains stable with a mean of ~42 units, significantly lower than the P6 spike of 100. Lead time consistency at 4 periods is highly confirmed.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 20-denier stay-up stocking, which usually sees stable demand outside of seasonal peaks like December or October (party/Halloween). Current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Historical analysis shows a one-off spike in Period 6 (100 units), but demand from Period 7 to 13 has stabilized at a lower mean. Specifically, the last 7 periods (P7-P13) have an average demand of approximately 43.1 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13). Currently, on-hand inventory is 159 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand (covering roughly 3.7 periods). We also have 5 units in-transit. A base stock levels should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given mean=~43 and volatility is moderate, a base stock around 215-230 units would be target. The current pipeline (159+5=164) is slightly below that, but because Holding Cost equals Profit ($1.0), the OR engine will target a 50% service level (z=0), meaning base_stock = mu_hat. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining stock for the stable demand regime, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 7-period average (~43 * 5 = 215) using recent_N=7.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '148033001' (Womens Nightwear/Socks & Tights) has stabilized into a post-spike demand regime after the temporary Period 6 surge. Current demand from Period 7 to 14 averages 40.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently high (137 units) due to previous large orders (Period 7-8) arriving. With a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, the OR backend targets a 50% service level, which generally means holding (1+L) periods of demand. Given L=4, we should aim for approx 200 units total (base_stock). On-hand (137) + In-transit (57) = 194. This is very close to the ideal total stock. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13). I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stabilized demand mean (~40-42) and volatility, as the earlier data (P1-P6) is less representative of the current regime found in the Carry-over insights.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 20 denier stay-up, which typically sees consistent demand without major seasonal spikes in late May. Historically, after a temporary demand peak of 100 in Period 6, demand has stabilized in a lower regime. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 15 is 42.0 units per period, with relatively low volatility. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on several concluded orders (P1-P4, P6-P9). On-hand inventory is currently 83 units, with 66 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 13, 14, and 15), bringing pipeline inventory to 149. With L=4, the base stock targets (L+1) or 5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~42, target stock should be roughly 210 units plus safety stock. Since 149 is below this, the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order. I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the post-spike stability (Period 7-15) for both demand mean and standard deviation.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Nouvelle 1p Stay Up' (leggings/tights), which generally shows stable demand outside of specific seasonal spikes. Reviewing historical data, a temporary spike occurred in Period 6 (100 units), but demand has since stabilized. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P8-P16) is approximately 41 units. Current on-hand inventory is 38 units with 127 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on history (P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). The pipeline includes orders from P13 (5), P14 (52), P15 (9), and P16 (61). We expect the P13 order to arrive during this period (P17) and become visible at the start of P18. Given Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level is 50%, which is lean. I am selecting recent_N=9 to capture the post-spike stability for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and setting L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent and well-recorded in the history.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a '20 denier stay-up' legging/tight. Current date is June 10, entering summer in the Northern Hemisphere, which typically sees a seasonal decline in hosiery demand compared to spring (hosiery is often a spring/autumn staple). Historical data from Period 7 to 17 shows a stable but lower demand regime, averaging ~41.5 units per period. The recent Period 17 demand was only 20 units, reinforcing the softening trend. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P13 order arriving in P17). I will use the last 11 samples (P7-P17) to capture this post-spike regime while excluding the P6 outlier (100 units). On-hand inventory is 23, with 162 in-transit, which balances against the expected demand for the next L+1 (5) periods (estimated at ~200 units). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 aligns the OR backend with the detected regime since the March spike.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a 20 denier stay-up stocking. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following a one-time spike in Period 6. Since Period 7, demand has averaged approximately 39.8 units per week (periods 7-18). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P17 and P18 from orders placed in P13 and P14). On-hand inventory is 40 units, with 127 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). Demand in the last four periods has been 54, 45, 20, and 35, showing some volatility but no clear upward trend. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 (representing the period since the regime shift after the P6 spike) to capture the current mean of ~40 units. Sigma_hat will also use N=12 to reflect current volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 (Women's Stay-Up/Leggings) is currently in a lower demand regime compared to the early periods. Period 20 occurs in late June, which typically doesn't exhibit extreme seasonality for this category in the absence of specific holiday events. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P10-P19) is approximately 35.2 units, significantly lower than the P1-P6 average (~61 units). The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P15 order arrived at P19 conclude), though P10-P12 orders appear to have been skipped or lost as they originated from zero-order periods, but actually reflect the flow from P9 to P13. However, checking specific arrivals: P13 arrived P17 (LT=4), P14 arrived P18 (LT=4), P15 arrived P19 (LT=4). Lead time is stable. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand trend (avg ~35) and set L to default (4). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to reflect the current lower volatility. With on-hand at 24 and in-transit at 151, the pipeline is relatively full compared to current demand levels; this strategy ensures we don't over-order while moving toward the new lower baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean (~35 units) over P10-P19 compared to P1-P9 (~59 units). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 (Women's Stay-Up Leggings) is in a stabilized demand regime with a mean of approximately 35 units based on data from Period 10 to 20. There was a temporary spike in Period 6 (100 units), but demand has consistently remained lower since late April. The actual lead time is confirmed to be exactly 4 periods based on the arrival history (e.g., Period 13 order arrived Period 17, Period 16 order arrived Period 20). My goal is to maintain the base stock level reflecting this lower demand regime (avg 35) while accounting for the lead time (L=4). Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current lower-demand environment (Periods 11-20 avg is ~35) without being overly influenced by the early-game spikes or the initial high seed samples. The OR backend will compute the order based on this recent mean to avoid overstocking, as holding costs are equal to profit per unit.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 20 denier stay-up, which typically experiences lower demand in the heat of summer (July). Our current date is 2019/07/08. Demand from Period 14 to Period 21 has averaged approximately 28.5 units, which is significantly lower than the P1-P13 average (~50). Specifically, the last four periods (P18-P21) show a further slowdown with an average of 22.25. On-hand inventory is currently high (93 units), covering over 4 periods of recent demand. Combined with 60 units in-transit (orders from P18-P21), we are well-stocked for the summer lull. Actual lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime shift (last 8 periods) and using default sigma_hat to manage volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Summer seasonality confirmed for leggings/tights SKU; mean demand dropped from ~50 to ~29 (-42%) starting mid-May.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is 20 denier stay-ups, which historically shows lower demand during the summer months (May-August). As noted in Period 22's carry-over insight, a regime shift occurred around Period 14, where mean demand dropped significantly due to seasonality. Demand over the last 9 periods (P14-P22) has averaged approximately 29 units per week, with a standard deviation of roughly 13.8 units. Lead time is highly stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 81 units, with 43 units in-transit (P19, P20, P21 arrivals pending). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 0.5, implying the backend targets the median demand. I am setting L to default (4) and using the recent_N method (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the low-demand summer regime while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the volatility observed in this period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 20-denier stay-up (tights/leggings), which shows strong downward seasonality during the summer months. Since mid-May (Period 14), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level. From Period 20 to 23, demand has been 10, 22, 29, and 22 respectively, with a mean of 20.75 units per period. This supports the carry-over insight of a summer demand drop to ~29 units, or even lower in recent weeks (~21 units). The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods across all historical arrivals. With high current on-hand inventory (92 units) and in-transit units (32), the system is well-covered for the (L+1) horizon (5 weeks). I will set mu_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture the current low-demand summer regime, and keep L and sigma_hat at their calculated/default settings reflecting this period of low volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is the height of summer. As noted in the Period 22 insight, demand for this 20-denier stay-up tights SKU has entered a lower seasonal regime (summer) characterized by significantly reduced demand compared to the spring months. Specifically, demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) has averaged approximately 19.4 units per week, which is even lower than the initial summer estimate of ~29. On-hand inventory is currently high (84 units) relative to this low demand. Given the lead time of 4 periods, total exposure covers 5 periods. At a mean of ~20 units/week, we need approximately 100 units of pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit). We currently have 84 on-hand and 44 in-transit (Total = 128), which is sufficient to cover demand without significant ordering. Using recent_N (N=5) for demand and the default lead time (confirmed consistently as 4), the OR engine will prioritize reducing the current excess inventory to minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the lower summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed (July): Average demand from P20-P24 is ~20 units, further confirming the seasonal shift previously noted in Period 22.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26. The SKU (20 denier stay-up leggings) is in a clear seasonal low (summer), which was confirmed in previous carry-over insights starting around Period 22. Demand from Period 20 to 25 has averaged ~21.1 units (10, 22, 29, 22, 14, 30), significantly lower than the springtime average. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across the entire history. Current on-hand is 58 and in-transit is 40 (total pipeline 98). With a lead time of 4, our coverage needs to span 5 periods (L+1). At an estimated 22 units/period, we need ~110 units of visibility; we currently have 98. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the OR target service level is 50%, meaning we aim for the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the summer demand trough and 'calculate' for lead time since it is highly consistent.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the mid-to-late summer trough for this 'Stay Up' leggings/tights SKU. Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward shift starting mid-May (P14), which has stabilized at a significantly lower mean. Over the last 7 periods (P20-P26), demand has averaged 21.1 units, compared to the spring average of ~42-50. The most recent samples (P24-P26) are 14, 30, and 21. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival pattern of P13-P21 orders. Inventory levels are currently being managed down to avoid high holding costs during this low-demand season; on-hand is 37 and in-transit is 48, totaling 85 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat specifically captures the summer regime to prevent over-ordering as we transition toward autumn.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 19, 2019. The product is 20 denier stay-ups, which typically experience a seasonal trough during the hot summer months (June-August). Demand has stabilized at a lower mean since the shift noted in Period 14. Average demand from Period 20 to 27 is approximately 21.75 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the Period 23 order arriving in Period 27. On-hand inventory is 33 units with 47 units in-transit (orders from P24, P26, P27). Since we are nearing the end of August, demand may begin to pick up slightly as the transition to autumn begins, but currently, there is no evidence of a spike. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable summer demand regime for forecasting mu_hat and sigma_hat, while maintaining the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26). Historical data shows a clear seasonal trough for 'Socks and Tights' during the summer months (May-July), with demand averaging ~23 units. In the last 4 periods (P25-P28), demand has shown a slight uptick to an average of ~27 units (30, 21, 26, 30). As we approach September, demand for 'stay-ups' and 'tights' typically begins to recover from the summer low as cooler autumn weather approaches. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 21 units, and there are 58 units in-transit (orders from P25, P26, P27, P28). I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=5 (covering the last 5 weeks of stabilized/slightly recovering demand) to capture this emerging trend while avoiding the very low mid-summer values. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery trend: Demand from P25-P28 smoothed to ~27 units, up from the July trough of ~20 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Historically, the demand for leggings and tights (stay-ups) shows a seasonal trough in July (avg ~20) and a recovery starting in late August (P25-P28 avg ~27). As we enter September, demand typically continues to trend upward toward the autumn baseline (~40-50 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 94 units in-transit. Past performance shows lead time is consistently 4 periods. My strategy is to use the recent recovery trend (N=5 for P25-P29, mean ~27) as the base for the OR backend, allowing the base-stock logic to handle the transition. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and 'calculate' for lead time to capture the stable 4-period arrival pattern. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock to meet the recovering demand without overstocking too early in the cycle.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery trend confirmed: Demand from P25-P29 averaged 27.2 units, demonstrating a steady increase from the July trough of ~20 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019). The SKU is '20 denier stay-ups', which is a seasonal product. History shows a clear 'summer trough' (July/August) with demand averaging ~20-25, followed by a 'post-summer recovery' starting in late August. Demand in the last 5 periods (P26-P30) was 21, 26, 30, 29, 31, averaging 27.4 units. Since we are entering September, demand for tights/leggings typically increases as the weather cools. Recent Carry-over insights confirm this upward trend from the July trough of ~20 to a current stable mean of ~27-30. However, the last two periods resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), indicating that demand is outstripping previous low-order phases. Lead time is highly stable at 4 periods. I will use recent memory (N=6) to capture the recovery trend from August while accommodating the slight seasonal rise. The OR backend uses a 50% service level target (Profit $1 / Holding $1), so providing an accurate mean is critical to avoid persistent stockouts during the autumn ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery trend confirmed: Demand from P26-P30 (late August/early September) averaged 27.4 units, representing a sustained increase from the July trough (~20 units). Stockouts in P29 and P30 confirm demand is currently exceeding supply.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Nouvelle 1p Stay Up' (leggings/tights) is exiting its summer demand trough. We are currently observing a significant demand spike: Period 31 demand reached 64 units, compared to the previous 5-period average of ~27 units. This aligned with late August/early September indicates the start of autumn seasonality. We have experienced stockouts for three consecutive periods (P29-P31), with on-hand inventory sitting at 0. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. To address the stockouts and the emerging high-demand regime, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma to capture the immediate upward momentum, focusing on the last 3 samples (29, 31, 64) which average 41.3 units per period. This shift is necessary to prevent further lost sales as we enter the peak autumn season.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 31 (64 units), confirming the start of the autumn recovery for tights/leggings. Demand has shifted from a summer average of ~20 to a late-summer average of ~27, and now appears to be trending higher. Stockouts occurred in P29, P30, and P31.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 20 denier leggings/tights, which exhibit strong seasonality. We are currently in late September (P33), exiting the summer trough and entering the autumn peak. Demand significantly spiked in Period 31 (64 units) and remained higher than the summer average in Period 32 (39 units), despite stockouts which suggest actual demand was higher than recorded sales. We have experienced four consecutive periods of stockouts (P29-P32), indicating our current inventory levels and incoming pipeline are insufficient for the seasonal recovery. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P30-P32) is approximately 45 units per week, but given the stockouts and established seasonal trend for hosiery, I anticipate demand will continue to climb towards the 50-60 range observed in earlier months (Spring). I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to catch current momentum, but adjusting sigma_hat explicitly to account for the increased volatility seen during these regime shifts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery regime confirmed: Significant demand spike in P31 (64) and consecutive stockouts (P29-P32) confirm demand has shifted upward from the summer average of ~20 to a new baseline of 45+ units as of late September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '148033001' (Womens Leggings/Tights) is entering its peak autumn/winter season. Current Period 34 (Late September) inventory is zero on-hand with significant stockouts recorded in the last five consecutive periods (P29-P33). Observed demand in P31 was 64 and P33 was 93; however, sales were capped by arrivals (36 in P33), making actual demand significantly higher than 'sold' units. The product is a seasonal basic (20 denier stay-ups) which typically sees high demand from October through December. I am shifting the mu_hat to an explicit value of 350 to cover the 5-period window (L+1=5) based on a projected weekly mean of ~70 units, accounting for the recent spike to 93 and expected seasonal acceleration. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 100 to handle the high volatility observed during regime shifts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: SKU is entering seasonal peak for hosiery. Demand in P31 (64) and P33 (93) suggests a new baseline of 70+ units/week. Sustained stockouts P29-P33 confirm immediate inventory deficit.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (20 denier stay-ups) has entered its peak autumn demand season. The recent demand history (P31: 64, P33: 93, P34: 68) shows a significant shift from the summer trough (~20) and late summer recovery (~27). Sustained stockouts since P29 highlight a critical inventory deficit. For Period 35, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 425, which reflects a forecast of 85 units per period over the review+lead time (L+1=5). This is based on the recent peaks and the seasonal nature of hosiery in October. I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 60 to allow the OR backend to maintain a higher safety stock during this volatile recovery phase. On-hand is currently 0, but there are 298 units in-transit (P31-P34 orders), which should begin arriving starting next period (P31 order due in P35 arrival phase).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand baseline has shifted to ~70-85 units/week starting P33 (late Sept/early Oct). Seasonal stockouts from P29-P34 confirm that demand is significantly outstripping previous supply levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. This SKU (20 denier stay-ups) is in its peak autumn seasonal regime. Demand significantly exceeds supply, evidenced by consecutive stockouts from P29 to P35. Recent demand samples show a sharp increase: P31 (64), P32 (39), P33 (93), P34 (68), and P35 (80). The average demand over these last 5 periods is 68.8 units. Given the seasonality of hosiery, we anticipate high demand to continue. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 85 = 425 to account for both the observed demand and the suppressed demand from stockouts. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P32, P33, P34, and P35). Sigma_hat is set to an explicit value of 45 to handle the high volatility (standard deviation of recent samples is ~20, and 45 provides a robust buffer for seasonal spikes). Total in-transit is 405, while on-hand is 0. The OR backend will use these parameters to generate an order that aims for a base stock level covering current and future expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Demand from P31-P35 averaged 68.8 units (reaching as high as 93), confirming a sustained high-demand regime for the October seasonal peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its peak autumn/winter season (October). Demand has shifted dramatically from a summer low of ~20 to an autumn average of ~70.5 units over the last 6 periods (P31-P36: 64, 39, 93, 68, 80, 71). Although we saw a stockout streak from P29 to P35, the arrival of 74 units in P36 (ordered P32) finally met demand, leaving a small on-hand inventory of 3. Lead time is highly stable at 4 periods. Given the context (tights/leggings in late October), we must maintain high stock levels to avoid further lost sales during the seasonal peak. mu_hat is set to reflect the current high-demand regime of ~70 units per week across the lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods), and sigma_hat is updated to capture the increased volatility (standard deviation of ~18 units per week).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Nouvelle 1p Stay Up' (leggings/tights) is currently in its peak autumn/winter season. Demand in Period 37 reached 102 units, continuing a sustained upward trend that began in September. Over the last 5 periods (P33-P37), demand has averaged 82.8 units per week. The system has experienced frequent stockouts due to this rapid seasonal acceleration. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 0 units on-hand and 291 in-transit (orders from P34-P36 totaling 144+127+20), we must ensure the forecast (mu_hat) captures the current peak to secure enough inventory for the coming month. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this 80+ unit regime, and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the increased volatility during peak season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Demand Average P33-P37 is 82.8 units, confirming a shift from the ~70 unit baseline previously observed in early October.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn peak for this tights/leggings SKU is intensifying as we enter November. Demands in P37 (102) and P38 (107) are the highest recorded in the recent window, pushing the average demand from P33-P38 to 86.8 units per week. This is a significant increase from the early October average of ~82. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to specifically capture this high-demand seasonal regime and avoid under-stocking, as the SKU has suffered multiple stockouts recently. With on-hand (37) and in-transit (254) totaling 291, and a 5-period requirement (L+1) estimating around 434 units, a substantial replenishment order is needed to meet the escalating seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak further intensified: Demand in P37 (102) and P38 (107) pushes the recent average (P33-P38) to 86.8 units/week, exceeding the previously noted ~83 unit baseline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the heart of the autumn/winter peak for leggings and tights (20 denier stay-ups). Demand has intensified significantly since late September (Period 33). The last six periods of demand (P34-P39) are: 68, 80, 71, 102, 107, 97, resulting in a mean of 87.5 units/week. This is a clear sustained regime shift from the early October average of ~70. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on this most recent high-demand regime (N=6) to ensure the base stock covers the (L+1) period risk window. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to capture the higher volatility associated with the peak season. On-hand is 67 and pipeline is 241, totaling 308. With a target stock level around (5 * 88) = 440, the OR engine will likely place another substantial order to maintain availability through the November peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified further: Demand regime from P34-P39 stabilized at a mean of ~88 units/week (Range: 68-107), confirming the transition from the previous ~70 unit baseline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. This SKU (Stay-up tights) is in its peak seasonal regime. In the last 5 periods (P36-P40), demand has averaged 89.4 units (71, 102, 107, 97, 70). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is low (17), but in-transit inventory is high (336), reflecting significant orders placed recently to catch up with the autumn spike. Because the regime is stable at this high level and we are approaching the holiday season (late November), maintaining a robust forecast is necessary. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat will capture the current high-demand baseline (~88 units/period) while smoothing outliers. This ensures the (1+L) base stock properly covers the 5-period risk horizon (current period + 4 lead periods).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand regime (P34-P40) is stable at ~89 units/week (Range: 70-107). Stockout risk remains high until the large P38-P40 pipeline orders arrive.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the peak demand season for leggings/tights (womens hosiery). Demand has stabilized at a high regime; the average demand from Period 34 to 41 is 89.1 units/week. Although Period 41 ended with a stockout (on-hand 0), a large volume is in transit (408 units). Specifically, the order from Period 38 (107 units) is expected to arrive during Period 42, which will alleviate the immediate stockout. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the stabilized peak demand of approximately 89 units per week (1+4=5 periods * 89 = 445). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=8 to reflect the current volatility within this high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand regime (P34-P41) remains stable at ~89 units/week (Range: 68-107). Large pipeline orders are beginning to arrive, but inventory remains lean due to sustained high demand.

Period 42 saw a massive demand spike of 159 units, which is significantly higher than the previous autumn peak average of ~89-90. While the pipeline is large (323 units), we currently have 0 on-hand inventory due to the P42 spike. For Period 43, we expect the 114 units ordered in Period 39 to arrive, but given the trend, demand may continue to exceed supply until the large P40/P41 orders land. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (covering P34-P42) to capture the current high-demand regime, which now averages approximately 98 units per week following the P42 surge. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime intensified significantly in Period 42: Demand hit 159 units, pushing the seasonal peak average from ~89 to ~98 units/week (P34-P42). Recent stockouts (P41, P42) highlight continued supply-demand imbalance despite large incoming replenishments.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (tights/leggings) is in its peak seasonal demand phase (Autumn/Winter). A major demand spike occurred in P42 (159 units), while P43 saw demand of 85 units, maintaining the elevated mean of ~98 units/week (P34-P43 average is ~97 units). On-hand inventory is currently low (29 units) and stockouts have been frequent (P41, P42). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P39 order in P43. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period while accounting for the large pipeline (350 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat (covering the P34-P43 peak regime) and sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen recently (range 68-159). The OR backend's inventory cap will moderate the order size given the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime intensified further: Period 34-43 average is ~97 units/week, driven by a seasonal peak spike of 159 in P42. Standard deviation has increased significantly during this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), the peak of the autumn/winter seasonal cycle for tights and leggings. The demand regime from P34 to P44 shows a significant upward trend and increased volatility, with a mean of approximately 101 units/week and a recent spike to 159 (P42) and high demand of 132 (P44). The carry-over insights confirm this intensified regime. Using a recent_N approach (N=11, covering the period from P34 to P44) captures this higher mean and volatility better than the long-term history. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With only 12 units on-hand and significant demand expected as we approach the end of the year, maintaining a robust base stock is necessary to avoid further stockouts, which have been frequent since P29.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime intensified further: Period 34-44 average is ~101 units/week, with sustained high demand through mid-December (P44: 132). High volatility (Range 68-159) remains a factor for safety stock settings.

Daily Profit: $84.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019/12/16 (Period 45) reached 177 units, reinforcing a significant upward trend during the December holiday peak (averaging ~121 units over the last 5 periods P41-P45, vs ~89 in the October/November window). The SKU (stay-up stockings) is likely in its highest seasonal demand phase (Christmas/New Year), and recent stockouts in P42 and P45 indicate that local demand is exceeding provided capacity. Base stock calculations need to account for this higher mean and elevated volatility (standard deviation > 40). I will use a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the shift from ~90 to ~120 units/week. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=12) to capture the increased volatility that began during the broader autumn peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand intensified (December): Mean demand increased to ~121 units/week (P41-P45) from the previous autumn baseline of ~89 (+36%). High volatility and stockouts continue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (stay-ups/tights) is in its peak seasonal period (late December). In Period 46, actual demand remained very high at 132 units, following a peak of 177 in Period 45. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P41-P46) is approximately 129.5 units/week, a significant increase from the previous autumn baseline of ~90. We are currently experiencing stockouts (0 on-hand), with 559 units in-transit. The lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the holiday/winter peak context, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture this intensified demand regime. Sigma_hat will also be set to recent performance (N=6) to account for the high volatility observed (range 85-177 in the last 6 periods). This should ensure the base stock is high enough to handle the remainder of the peak season once the pipeline orders start arriving.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Winter peak demand confirmed (Dec 2019): Mean demand for P41-P46 increased to ~130 units/week (+46% from autumn baseline of ~89). Significant volatility and stockouts continue to dominate the supply situation.
