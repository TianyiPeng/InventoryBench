Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for the 'Sally Structure TVP' (Knitwear Jumper). This is a seasonal apparel item. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks of 2019 (Jan-early Feb) shows a mean of 17.8 and a standard deviation of 2.28. Given the date (Feb 11th), we are moving further into the spring season when demand for heavier knitwear might begin to taper, but for now, we will rely on the provided 5 samples. L=4, so our window for mu_hat and sigma_hat is L+1=5 periods. We will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most relevant demand statistics provided in the prompt.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a textured cotton-blend jumper (Sweater/Knitwear). Historical demand samples (Jan 7 - Feb 4) show a stable mean of roughly 17.8 units/week. In Period 1, demand was 11. Since we started with 0 on-hand, we lost those 11 sales. We have 22 units in transit from Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5. Based on historical data [20, 14, 19, 18, 18] and the recent P1 demand of 11, the average demand is 16.66. Period 1's lower demand might be a slight dip after early February. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (encompassing the 5 historical samples + Period 1) to stabilize the forecast against the initial stockout and reflect current seasonality for a knitwear item in mid-February.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand inventory is 0, with 45 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The product is a cotton-blend sweater from the 'Divided' collection. In February, demand has increased (P1: 11, P2: 31) compared to the January average (pre-game samples avg: 17.8), likely due to late-winter/early-spring fashion resets. Because the promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals are expected until Period 5. Consequently, we've lost sales in P1 and P2 (demand was 42 units total). To stabilize the forecast, I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 (5 pre-game samples + 2 active periods) to capture the trend while accommodating the recent demand spike. I am keeping the lead time at the promised 4 periods as it is too early to observe any arrival deviations.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a textured cotton-blend knit jumper from the Divided collection. Initial historical demand (Jan-Feb) averaged ~17.8 units. The first three periods of the game (Feb 11 - Feb 25) showed demands of 11, 31, and 14 (average 18.6). We have consistently been out of stock because the promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (placed Period 1) is not expected until Period 5 (visible at start of Period 6). Total pipeline inventory is 75 units (22+23+30). There is no evidence of a regime shift or lost orders yet, as we haven't reached the promised lead time delivery window. I will use the promised lead time of 4. For demand, I'll use all game samples (N=3) + the 5 pre-game samples to establish a stable mean and variance, as the demand seems fairly steady around 18 units/week.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is a textured cotton-blend jumper, which is seasonally appropriate for early spring (March). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (22 units) were expected to arrive in Period 5 (this period). According to the game rules, arrivals for Period 5 occur AFTER the decision and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals in the history so far (up to Period 4) for an order placed in Period 1 is normal and expected behavior given the 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 0, and 104 units are in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4: 22+23+30+29=104). Initial demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 17.8 units. Recent demand (P1-P4) averages 18.0 units (11, 31, 14, 16), though P2 saw a spike. Given the steady demand and the fact that we are awaiting our first shipment, I will use the established mean and default lead time settings. The OR engine will set a base stock level to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a textured cotton-blend sweater from the 'Divided' collection. Historical demand samples (Jan/early Feb) were around 17.8 units/week. Observed demand in the game (Periods 1-5) has been [11, 31, 14, 16, 19], averaging 18.2. Period 2 saw a spike to 31, but the rest are stable. The first order (placed P1) arrived in P5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), but the pipeline is well-stocked with 89 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). Given L=4, my parameters must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use the recent 5 periods of game demand to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, as they are consistent with the pre-game samples. Since L=4 is confirmed, I will use the default method for L.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). Looking at the history, the actual lead time L=4 is confirmed (P1 arrived P5; P2 arrived P6). Demand has been more volatile than the initial samples, with recent peaks of 31 and 34 units. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 94 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). The order from P3 (30 units) is expected to arrive during Period 7, meaning it will be available for the 'Period 7 conclude' status. The current demand regime appears slightly higher than the pre-game samples (mean of ~18). Over the 6 periods, the mean is 20.8. Given the recent peaks, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this slight upward trend and volatility. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to account for the high standard deviation observed in periods 2 and 6. The 94 units in pipeline plus the expected arrival should eventually stabilize the stockout situation, but we need robust parameters given the 4-period lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a textured cotton-blend jumper, which fits spring seasonality. Demand has shown a significant upward trend over the last three periods (34, 38, and historical context of ~18-20), while inventory levels have frequently hit zero, resulting in lost sales. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on concluding data from P5, P6, and P7. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 101 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). The order from P4 (29 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P8) and become visible in the next decision phase. To address the apparent upward shift in demand and prevent further stockouts during the L+1 window, I am setting mu_hat to 120 (approx 20 per period for 6 periods) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the increased demand volume observed in March.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift identified starting P6: Weekly demand increased from avg ~18 to avg ~35 (+94%), likely due to spring seasonality for the knitwear category.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a 'knitwear jumper', which follows a spring seasonal pattern. History shows a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 6: the average weekly demand jumped from ~18 to ~35 units. Current inventory is at 0 units on-hand with 115 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Period 8 demand was 34 (avg since P6: 35.33). We need to set parameters to cover the current demand regime (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and variance seen during this spring shift (Periods 6, 7, 8). L is set to calculate as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are experiencing a significant stockout situation. The product is a textured cotton-blend knit jumper (knitwear), and we are seeing a sustained demand regime shift that began in Period 6. Historical demand (Periods 1-5) averaged 18.2 units, but demand since Period 6 (Periods 6-9) has averaged 35.5 units, nearly double the initial rate. This aligns with spring seasonality for light knitwear. Despite regular arrivals confirming the promised 4-period lead time, we have been under-ordering and running out of stock immediately upon arrival because the OR backend's default stats are still heavily weighted by the lower early-season demand. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 148 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). To correct for this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to focus specifically on the high-demand regime since P6. This will raise the base stock level to better cover the current demand rate over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/22. The product is a knitwear jumper, which has seen a sustained demand increase since Period 6 (March 18th). Over the last 5 completed periods (P6-P10), the mean demand is 33.6 units, compared to the pre-shift mean of ~18. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is very low at 2 units, and we have been consistently stocking out or nearly stocking out, indicating we need to maintain higher target stock levels (base stock) to meet this higher demand regime. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current demand mean and volatility, while keeping the lead time at the confirmed 4 periods (L=4).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (April 29, 2019). The product is a 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater (knitwear). Historically, demand showed a regime shift around Period 6 (March 18), likely due to early spring seasonality, increasing from an average of ~18 to ~35. However, the last two periods (P10 and P11) have shown a significant cooldown (26 and 16 units), suggesting the initial spring peak is subsiding as we move toward late spring/early summer. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 23, with plenty in-transit (146 units). Given the recent demand drop, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P7-P11) which smooths the transition from the peak (38, 34, 36) to the current lower levels (26, 16). This results in an average demand of 30 per period. For L+1=5 periods, mu_hat should reflect 150. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 will allow the OR backend to capture this recent cooling trend and avoid excessive overstocking as seasonality shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed starting P10: avg demand decreased from ~35 (peak spring) to ~21 (late April) based on the last two observations.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, transitioning from spring into summer for this textured cotton-blend knit jumper. As noted in the carry-over insights, demand peaked at ~35 units during March/April but has since shown signs of cooling as temperatures likely rise. Specifically, the last three periods (P10-P12) showed demands of 26, 16, and 32, averaging 24.6 units. While P12 (32) was higher than P11 (16), both are below the spring peak average. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With 34 units on hand and 118 in-transit (covering orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12), we are well-positioned for the current demand level. To prevent overstocking during this seasonal cooldown, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat (P9-P12: 36, 26, 16, 32; avg 27.5) to capture the recent volatility and slight downward trend while maintaining a safe buffer. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the actual variability seen recently.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is a knitwear jumper, which is subject to spring/summer seasonality. Demand analysis: P1-P5 (pre-peak) avg ~18; P6-P10 (peak spring) avg ~33.6; P11-P13 (post-peak cooling) avg ~20.6. The last three periods (16, 32, 14) confirm a downward shift compared to the P6-P10 peak. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this lower late-spring demand level of ~20.6 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (60) plus in-transit (96) equals 156 units, which is quite high relative to current demand (~7-8 weeks of coverage), so the OR backend should naturally reduce order quantities. I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility (16, 32, 14) which is higher than the early period stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: P11-P13 average demand (~21) is 38% lower than P6-P10 peak avg (~34), signaling the end of the spring knitwear peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 15 (May 20, 2019). The product is a knitwear jumper, which has transitioned from a high-demand spring peak (avg ~34 units/week in March/April) to a lower demand regime (avg ~20 units/week in May). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 80 units, and there are 59 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 11-13). Total pipeline inventory is 139 units. Based on the recent demand cooling (last 5 periods: 26, 16, 32, 14, 17; mean = 21), the pipeline significantly exceeds the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). My strategy is to set parameters that reflect this lower demand regime and allow the OR backend to minimize orders, preventing further inventory buildup while clearing the existing stock. I'm choosing N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak stability seen since Period 10.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late May (2019/5/27). The product is a sweater (knitwear), which experienced a significant spring demand surge (avg ~34) that has now clearly plateaued or entered a summer cooling phase. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has averaged 19.8 units (16, 32, 14, 17, 20), which is consistent with the 'demand cooling' insight previously identified. On-hand inventory is currently high (86 units) due to deliveries from orders placed during the peak period, and there are 33 units still in transit (from P12 and P13). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and the sustained lower demand regime, I am using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the recent stable 'cool' demand (~20 units/week). This will likely lead to zero or minimal orders as the backend drains the excess stock.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 (June 3). The product is a knitwear Jumper, which is entering the low-demand summer season. History shows a clear demand shift: after a spring peak (avg ~34 units in March/April), demand has cooled significantly. For Periods 13-16, demand was 14, 17, 20, and 13 respectively (avg ~16), which is roughly 53% lower than the spring peak. On-hand inventory is high (88 units), sufficient to cover nearly 5.5 periods of the current average demand. With 25 units in-transit (orders from Period 13 and 16), the pipeline is full relative to expected sales. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 captures the post-peak cooling (avg ~18.67), while sigma_hat is set to default to reflect the standard variation across the full history to avoid under-protecting against spikes.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (Period 13-16): knitwear demand stabilized at avg ~16 units/week, down from the spring peak of ~34 (53% decrease).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, entering the summer season for 'knitwear'. Historically, demand peaked in March/April (~34 units/week) and has substantially cooled. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has averaged 14.8 units/week (14, 17, 20, 13, 10), confirming a stable low-demand summer regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 96 units on-hand and 20 units in-transit (ordered P16 and P17), we have 116 units to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current rate of ~15 units/week, we have roughly 7.7 weeks of supply. Therefore, we need to maintain low inventory levels to avoid excessive holding costs. For the mu_hat forecast, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture this stabilized summer demand of ~15 units/week (total 5*15 = 75 for mu_hat), which is well below our current inventory position. This will result in zero or minimal orders until the stock level depletes further.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June), and demand for this cotton-blend knit jumper has transitioned into a stable summer regime. Following a spring peak (averaging ~34 units/week), demand from Period 13-18 has stabilized at an average of 16.1 units/week (last six periods: 14, 17, 20, 13, 10, 23). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 73 units with 20 units in transit (ordered in P16, P17). Given the current demand rate, the total pipeline (93 units) covers approximately 5.8 weeks of demand, which is sufficient to meet the coverage target of L+1 (5 weeks). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect this stabilized summer demand regime and maintain the default lead time (4) and sigma settings.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the summer regime for knitwear (Sally Structure TVP sweater) with the date being June 24th. Demand has dropped significantly from the spring peak (~34 units) and has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P13-P19) at an average of approximately 14.4 units per week. Although P18 saw a slight spike (23), P19 was very low (4), confirming a continuing low-demand summer pattern. The inventory position is currently high (On-hand: 69), which is more than sufficient to cover immediate demand while we wait for small in-transit orders (26 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect this lower summer baseline, preventing the OR backend from over-ordering while we clear out existing high stock levels. The OR backend's cap and base stock logic, combined with these parameters, will likely result in small or zero orders until on-hand levels normalize against current demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 13-19): Knitwear demand has stabilized at an average of ~14.4 units/week, down from the spring peak of ~34 (58% decrease).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are firmly in the summer demand regime for knitwear. Recent demand (P17-P20) has been very low, with values of 10, 23, 4, and 5 (average ~10.5). However, the broader summer period (starting P13) averages ~13.2 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 71 units, which is quite high relative to this low-demand state and is incurring holding costs. The in-transit inventory is 20 units (ordered in Periods 17, 19, and 20). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock level (71 on-hand + 20 in-transit = 91 units pipeline) versus an expected 5-period demand (L+1) of only ~65-70 units, the OR backend will naturally minimize ordering. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized summer demand (since P13) while allowing the system to react to the low volatility observed.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a cotton-blend knit jumper, which is currently in its off-season (summer, early July). Since the demand stabilization noted in Period 17, the average weekly demand has continued to decrease slightly. From Period 13 to Period 21, the average demand is ~14.3. However, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21), the average has dropped further to 10.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high (72 units), which covers over 6 weeks of demand at the current rate. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set parameters that reflect this lower summer demand floor to allow current high inventory to bleed down without triggering excessive new orders, as the current stock safely covers the lead time and review period (L+1 = 5 weeks).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 17-21) has softened further: average weekly demand dropped to ~10.8 units compared to the early summer average of ~14.4.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 23 (July 15), observing demand for a 'Sally Structure TVP' (knitwear/jumper). The product is in a clear summer low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 10 periods (P13-P22) is 12.9 units. The most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) show an average of 13.0 units, despite a slight spike to 21 last period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 51 units, which covers nearly 4 weeks of demand at current rates. Total pipeline (On-hand 51 + In-transit 10 = 61) covers approximately 4.7 weeks. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to provide a stable estimate of the summer regime (approx 13 units/week) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the recent localized volatility (the drop to 4 and spike to 21). This keeps the base stock low to match the seasonal trough and avoid excessive holding costs on a fading product category.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516903005' is a textured cotton-blend jumper (knitwear). Historically, demand peaked in Spring (P6-P10, avg ~34) and has been in a sustained decline through Summer. The current Summer demand regime (P17-P23) shows an average of ~12.6 units per week (min 4, max 23). The most recent 3 periods (P21-P23) average 15.3 units. Since it is currently July 22nd, we remain in the Summer trough for knitwear but should monitor for early Autumn interest in next few weeks. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 44 and In-transit is 33 (ordered P20, P21, P22, P23). Total pipeline + on-hand is 77, which covers approx 5-6 weeks of current demand. I will use a recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current Summer stabilization while allowing for minor volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Summer demand stabilization confirmed (P17-P23). Average weekly demand is 12.6 units units (range 4-23), down significantly from the Spring peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late July (Period 25). The product is a cotton-blend knit jumper. Historically, demand peaked in spring (P6-P10) at ~34 units/week and transitioned to a lower summer regime. For the last 8 periods (P17-P24), demand has averaged 11.6 units/week, with a slight uptick in volatility recently. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand is 40 and in-transit is 45 (total 85). Given the current summer stability, we anticipate demand to remain low until potential autumn stocking transitions, which typically start in August/September. Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat captures the stable summer demand (~11.6 * 5 = 58 units needed for pipeline), and sigma_hat with recent_N=8 accounts for recent fluctuations (sigma ~ 5.9). Total inventory of 85 is sufficient, but we will maintain these parameters to ensure the base stock levels remain aligned with current trends.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a knitwear jumper (Sally Structure TVP), currently in the transition from late summer to the approach of autumn (Date: 2019/8/5). Historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern: high demand during spring (avg ~34), dropping to a summer trough (avg ~12.6). Over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), demand has been 12, 21, 13, 5, 19 (avg 14.0), which aligns with the summer stabilization previously observed. We are exiting the lowest demand phase for knitwear. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 22, with 44 units in-transit (orders from P22, P23, P24). The orders placed in P22 (2 units), P23 (29 units), and P24 (13 units) are expected to arrive in P26, P27, and P28 respectively. To calculate parameters, I am using a recent window of 13 periods (P13 onwards) to capture the post-spring regime, which reflects the lower summer-to-autumn baseline while preventing over-ordering based on the obsolete spring peak. This provides a stable mean (~14) and captures the current volatility (std ~6.5) to maintain appropriate safety stock as we approach potential autumn demand increases.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a cotton-blend jumper. We are currently in mid-August (Period 27). After a sustained low-demand summer period (averaging ~12-14 units), Period 26 showed a significant demand spike to 36 units. This likely signals the beginning of the 'Back to School' or 'Pre-Autumn' transition for knitwear. Inventory is currently depleted (0 on-hand) due to this spike. In-transit inventory is 66 units, with 29 units ordered in P23 expected to arrive this period (P27) and 13 units from P24 expected in P28. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will set L to 'calculate'. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent uptick while balancing it against the preceding summer lows, effectively preparing for an autumn regime shift (P23-P26 avg is ~18.25). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect the increased volatility observed in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn demand transition detected in Period 26: demand spiked to 36 units from a previous 10-week average of ~12 units, signaling the end of the summer low regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the Autumn demand peak (Knitwear/Sweater). Period 27 demand spiked significantly to 67 units following a spike of 36 units in Period 26, confirming a rapid transition from the summer low (~12/week) to an autumn high. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 77 units in-transit (orders from P24, P26, P27). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward trajectory observed in the last two weeks (avg ~51.5), I will base mu_hat on the most recent 2-week average to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture this seasonal surge. sigma_hat will also be calculated based on this recent high-volatility period (N=2) to account for the uncertainty in the slope of the autumn demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed starting Period 26: demand rose from ~12 to avg 51.5 units/week in P26-P27 (+329%), consistent with seasonal trends for Knitwear.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jumper in a textured cotton-blend knit', which is highly seasonal. We are now in late August (Period 29), and demand has surged dramatically over the last three weeks (P26: 36, P27: 67, P28: 68), confirming the Autumn demand regime shift noted in previous carry-overs. The average demand for the last three weeks is ~57 units per week. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a high-demand regime, I must set parameters to ensure we build a sufficient base stock to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific peak regime without dilution from the summer low, translating to an expected demand of ~57 * 5 = 285 units across the horizon. This will trigger the OR backend to place aggressive orders to replenish the pipeline and satisfy the high seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand peak confirmed: Demand surged from ~12 to avg 67.5 units/week in P27-P28 (+462%) as of 2019/8/19.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Autumn/Winter peak for knitwear, which began around Period 26 (August). Historical demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 36, 67, 68, and 59, establishing a new high-demand regime with an average of approximately 57.5 units per week. This is a massive jump from the summer average of ~12. The most recent three periods (P27-P29) average 64.7 units, showing relative stability at this high level. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and demand is being lost. Although there is a large pipeline (239 units), we must maintain high base stock parameters to ensure future arrivals cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific peak regime without being diluted by the summer lows. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak stabilized (P27-P29): Demand shifted from summer lows (~12) to a high-demand regime averaging ~65 units/week (+440%).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Autumn/Winter peak for knitwear, which began around Period 26/27. The most recent demand observation in Period 30 was 145 units, a significantly higher spike than previous weeks (which averaged around 65 in the initial stage of this peak). This surge coincides with early September, typically a high-volume period for sweaters. On-hand inventory is currently depleted (0), and although 288 units are in-transit, demand is rapidly outpacing the current forecast. To capture this momentum and avoid stockouts during this high-profit window ($19/unit profit vs $1/unit holding), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 110. This assumes demand will sustain a high average (averaging the recent spike with the previous high plateau). Sigma_hat is also set explicitly higher to reflect the increased volatility seen in the jump from ~60 to 145. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand surge: Weekly demand spiked to 145 in Period 30, following a high plateau of ~65 in P27-P29. This indicates a potential second-stage peak in the knitwear category for early September.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak Autumn/Winter season (September). Recent demand has surged significantly: Period 30 (145 units) and Period 31 (152 units). This confirms the 'second-stage peak' hypothesized in the previous period. The current average demand over the last two weeks is 148.5 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P26 and P27 orders arriving with L=4). However, current on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand far outstripping supply. Total in-transit is 425 units (from orders in P28, P29, P30, P31, and P32). To capture this high-demand regime and prevent stockouts during the peak, I will use recent_N=2 for demand mean and variance to reflect the newest plateau (~150 units/week). The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock covering (1+4)=5 periods, approximately 750 units. With 425 in-transit and 0 on-hand, the engine will order the remaining needed capacity (capped by policy).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak intensified: Weekly demand stabilized at a new high plateau of ~150 units (P30-P31), up from the previous plateau of ~65 (P27-P29).

The SKU 516903005 (Knitwear Jumper) is in a high-demand Autumn/Winter regime. Demand has surged significantly: Period 30 (145), Period 31 (152), and now Period 32 (193). The last three weeks show a mean demand of approximately 163 units, indicating a accelerating peak as we move into late September. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a pipeline of 494 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts during this peak, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the most recent trend (~170 units/period) across the lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods). Sigma_hat is also increased to account for the high volatility observed during the seasonal ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak intensification: Demand increased from a plateau of ~150 (P30-P31) to 193 in Period 32, representing a 28% week-over-week increase and confirming the seasonal strength of the knitwear category in late September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 516903005 (Knitwear Jumper) is experiencing an explosive demand surge as we enter late September (Period 33 demand was 594), far exceeding the previous plateau of ~150-190. This likely reflects a peak seasonal event or major promotional push. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. However, the current inventory position (0 on-hand, 666 in-transit) is extremely critical given that demand has spiked nearly 300% week-over-week. To prevent massive lost sales during this peak, I am aggressively increasing mu_hat using an explicit value. I am forecasting the next several periods' average demand to be significantly higher than the last few weeks to capture this peak. Given the jump from 193 to 594, I'll set a base for mu_hat reflecting an average demand of approximately 450 per week over the (L+1) horizon (5 * 450 = 2250). Sigma_hat is also set explicitly to account for the high volatility shown by this sudden triple-digit spike.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak demand regime detected Period 33: Demand increased from ~193 to 594 (207% increase), representing a massive seasonal surge for knitwear in late September.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-autumn peak for the knitwear category (2019/10/07). Demand has been extremely volatile: after a massive spike to 594 in P33, it dropped to 147 in P34. This suggests the 594 may have been an outlier or a specific event spike, but the overall regime remains much higher than summer levels. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P31-P34) is approx 259 units. However, given the product (sweaters) and the date (October), demand is expected to remain high as we approach winter. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this high-demand autumn regime while smoothing the P33 outlier. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to account for the extreme high variance observed recently. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P34 conclusion. On-hand is 0, but pipeline inventory is very high (1411 units), largely due to the large order placed in P34, which should cover the coming weeks as it begins to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in Autumn peak: P33 spike (594) followed by P34 drop (147) indicates high variance within the high-demand regime (~250-300 units/week avg).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3103.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand Autumn/Winter regime (October). Demand in the last two periods has been 147 and 164, following a 'super-peak' of 594 in P33. The average demand for the last five periods (P31-P35) is approximately 242 units/week, while the last two periods suggest a stabilization around 155 units. Given the extreme volatility (sigma) observed in the autumn peak, I will use a conservative N=5 for mu_hat (approx 242 units/week) to ensure the base stock covers potential bounce-backs in demand, while using N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the high variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory is very high (1861 units), reflecting large orders placed during the P33-P34 surge; these are expected to arrive in the coming weeks and should satisfy most demand, so the OR backend will likely scale back ordering significantly due to the pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-demand regime continues: P31-P35 average demand is ~242 units/week, though recent weeks (P34-P35) show a lower plateau of ~155 units compared to the P33 outlier (594). High volatility remains a key characteristic of this regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a cotton-blend sweater, currently in its Autumn/Winter peak. Demand in Period 36 was 116 units, following a volatile high-demand regime. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P31-P36) is approximately 227 units, though this includes the massive P33 spike (594). Removing the P33 outlier, the average for P31, P32, P34, P35, and P36 is 154 units. Given the seasonality, October/November demand for knitwear is expected to remain high. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 54 and there is a very large pipeline (1791 units), mostly due to large orders placed in P34 (818) and P35 (627). To prevent over-ordering while maintaining service levels during this volatile peak, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering the last 5 periods P32-P36, avg ~227) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility (std dev is significant due to the P33 spike).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-demand regime (P31-P36) average stabilized around 227 units/week (or ~154 excluding P33 outlier). Significant pipeline inventory (1791) is expected to arrive over the next 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3007.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in an Autumn/Winter peak for knitwear. As of Period 38 (late October), the demand regime has stabilized following the super-peak (P33) and subsequent high volatility. Recent demand (P34-P37) has recorded 147, 164, 116, and 166 units, respectively, averaging approximately 148 units/week. This represents a more sustainable plateau compared to the outlier spike of 594 in P33. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current stable plateau of ~148 units/week, which is significantly higher than the early Autumn regime (~65) but lower than the extremely volatile super-peak average (~242). The pipeline inventory is very high (1631 units) due to large orders placed during the P33-P35 volatility. With 'on-hand' + 'in-transit' totaling 1778 units and an expected demand of ~148 units/week over the lead time (L=4), we have approximately 12 weeks of coverage. The OR engine's 'cap' mechanism and the current pipeline relative to the new mu_hat will naturally restrict further large ordering to prevent excessive overstocking as we move deeper into the season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand plateau confirmed (P34-P37): Demand has stabilized at an average of ~148 units/week, following the late-September super-peak volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the Autumn/Winter high-demand regime, specifically post the late-September peak and volatility. Reviewing demand from Period 34 to 38, we observe values of 147, 164, 116, 166, and 139. This confirms a stable plateau at an average of approximately 146.4 units per week. The arrival of the large Period 34 order (818 units) in Period 38 has brought the on-hand inventory to 826 units. With 813 units still in-transit (ordered in P35-P37), the current pipeline is very high (1639 units). Given 8 periods remain in the game, and the current on-hand already covers over 5 periods of forecasted demand, additional ordering is unnecessary and would only increase holding costs. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent plateau using recent_N=5 (N=5 covering P34-P38) and keep L at the promised 4 periods, which has been consistent throughout the history. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized variance of this regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a cotton-blend Jumper (Knitwear), which typically peaks in Autumn and plateaus during Winter. We are currently in Period 40 (Nov 11), entering late Autumn/early Winter. Recent history shows a clear cooling trend: after a late-September super-peak (P33 demand of 594), demand stabilized around 150 (P34-P37) and has further dropped in the last two periods (P38: 139, P39: 73). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P34-P39) is 147, but the last two periods suggest a downward shift towards a Winter baseline. Currently, we have 1,380 units on-hand and 186 in-transit (Total pipeline: 1,566). Given an expected demand of ~100-140 units per week, the current stock covers approximately 11-15 weeks, which is excessive as we approach the end of the game (Period 47). The large arrivals from the P34-P35 orders (818 and 627 units respectively) have bloated the inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set a conservative demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 6 periods (N=6) to account for the post-peak plateau while allowing the OR backend to stop ordering due to the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed in late Autumn (starting P38): Demand dropped from a plateau of ~150 (P34-P37) to an average of 106 in P38-P39 (-29%), signaling a transition from Autumn peak to Winter stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $193.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a transition from the Autumn/Winter peak to a more stable late-year regime. Demand in the most recent three periods (P38-P40: 139, 73, 83) averages approximately 98.3 units/week, confirming a cooling trend from the previous plateau of ~150. Combined with a very high on-hand inventory of 1384 units\u2014largely due to massive orders placed during the September volatility arriving now (P34-P36 orders)\u2014the priority is to avoid further overstocking as holding costs ($1/unit/period) will significantly impact profit if inventory remains at these levels. The current on-hand inventory already covers approximately 14 weeks of demand at the current rate (1384 / 98.3). Therefore, I am setting parameters to cease ordering. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent cooling (98.3 * 5 = 491.5), and sigma_hat is adjusted to the same period to capture the recent lowered volatility. This will result in a base stock level significantly below the pipeline inventory, naturally resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: P38-P40 average demand (~98) is roughly 34% lower than the P34-P37 plateau (~148). Significant overstock condition exists with 1384 units on hand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a significant overstock position with 1,409 units on hand, while recent demand (P38-P41) has cooled to an average of approximately 92 units per week. This cooling trend aligns with the transition from the Autumn/Winter peak to a more stable late-year regime. With only 6 periods remaining in the game (P42-P47) and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any new orders placed now would arrive in P46, leaving only one more period of demand to satisfy. Given that the current on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover more than 15 weeks of demand at the current rate (1409 / 92.25 \u2248 15.2), ordering any more units would only increase holding costs without contributing to additional sales. I am setting L to 4 as confirmed by history, and using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent cooling regime, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock calculation stays well below current inventory levels to prevent ordering.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Winter demand cooling (P38-P41): Demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~92 units/week, down from the P34-P37 plateau of ~148 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 516903005 (Knitwear Jumper) is in a clear descending demand phase as winter begins in December. Since Period 38, demand has consistently dropped from peak levels (~150) to a recent 5-period average (P38-P42) of 81.6 units. The most recent demand was only 39 units. Current on-hand inventory is 1370 units, which covers over 16 weeks of demand at the current average rate. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P43-P47) and a 4-period lead time, any order placed now would arrive in the final period (P47). Given the massive overstock (1370 units on hand vs. ~400 units expected total remaining demand), no further orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect the current cooling demand regime (N=5) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation recognizes the surplus relative to the lower demand mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling transition to Winter regime (P38-P42): Average demand has dropped to 81.6 units/week, with the most recent observation (P42) at 39 units, reflecting a post-peak seasonal decline for knitwear.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 516903005 (Knitwear/Jumper) is currently in a deep seasonal decline following the Autumn/Winter peak. Demand has consistently dropped over the last 6 periods, from a plateau of ~150 units down to the most recent observation of 23 units. The current on-hand inventory is 1347 units, which is extremely high given the current weekly demand (average ~54 units over the last 6 periods, but only ~31 over the last 2). This inventory level covers more than 25 weeks of demand at current rates. No further orders are needed. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Parameters are set to reflect the current lower-demand regime (Winter) while acknowledging the high inventory position to prevent any further ordering by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (starting P42): Average demand has dropped significantly to ~31 units/week (P42-P43), confirming the post-peak seasonal decline for knitwear. Inventory is currently in an overstock position (1300+ units).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Knitwear Jumper) is in a clear late-season decline as we approach the end of the year (2019/12/16). Demand has consistently dropped from the Autumn/Winter peak (avg ~148) to a current low-demand regime averaging ~24 units over the last three periods (P42-P44). On-hand inventory is extremely high at 1336 units, which is enough to cover over 50 weeks of current demand. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (ending P47), the objective is to minimize further holding costs while liquidating existing stock. No new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-period window to reflect this late-season cooling, while the backend's capped policy and my massive on-hand surplus will naturally result in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P42-P44) confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~24 units/week, down from ~81.6 in the previous transition, reflecting late-season clearance behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1784.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 516903005 (Knitwear/Jumper). We are in Period 46 (Dec 23). Period 45 saw a demand spike to 156 units (likely pre-Christmas/Winter surge), which contrasts with the previous low Winter regime of ~24 units/week. However, the current on-hand inventory is 1180 units, which vastly exceeds any realistic demand forecast for the remaining 4-5 periods of a (1+L) window. Given the profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is high (approx 95%), but the massive overstock (~1180 units vs. mean demand of ~33 in the last 4 periods or even the recent 156 spike) means no new orders should be placed. I will set parameters to reflect the current winter/holiday volatility while allowing the OR backend to continue 'not ordering' by capping the base stock well below current inventory levels. I'll use recent_N=4 for demand to capture both the low winter average and the recent holiday spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected Period 45: Demand rose from ~15 units to 156 units, reflecting a pre-Christmas surge in the knitwear category.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1720.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand holiday period (Dec 23-30), with recent demand for Periods 45 and 46 spiking to 156 and 145 units respectively. However, the simulation date is Dec 30, meaning we are at the end of the holiday peak and heading into January, which typically sees a sharp decline in knitwear demand. More importantly, the current inventory position is extremely heavy (1,035 units on hand), which is significantly higher than even the most aggressive recent demand levels. Given that the promised lead time is 4 periods and we have sufficient stock to cover over 7 weeks of current peak demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent holiday spike for accuracy, but the backend's capped policy will ensure no units are ordered given the surplus on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed (P45-P46): avg demand increased to ~150 units/week from late-winter lows of ~24.
