Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is a 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics). Observed historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a declining trend: 78, 58, 47, 42, 40. This suggests a post-holiday/early-year cooling period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no history of actual arrivals, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat), the recent period is stable around 40, whereas the full average is higher (~53). Using 'recent_N' with N=3 captures the current stable regime (47, 42, 40). mu_hat will be (1+L) * mean(recent_3) = 5 * 43 = 215. sigma_hat will also use recent_3 to reflect recent volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock and order enough to cover the lead time + review period, minus existing inventory (which is currently 0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. In Period 1, we ordered 49 units, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, these units are currently in-transit and will not arrive until Period 5 (visible at Period 6). Demand in the first five historical samples was [78, 58, 47, 42, 40], showing a clear downward trend from early January. However, Period 1 actual demand was 48, which suggests the decline has leveled off. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for demand forecasting to capture this stabilization around 40-50 units per week. Lead time is set to default (4) as we have no evidence yet of deviations. mu_hat and sigma_hat are scaled by (1+L) = 5.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a basic women's t-shirt. The current inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, demand in Period 2 spiked to 120 (from ~40-80 in January/early Feb), and we have lost sales in both Period 1 and 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders placed in P1 (49 units) and P2 (51 units) are still in-transit and not expected until P5 and P6 respectively. The total in-transit is 100. Demand history shows 78, 58, 47, 42, 40 (Jan-Feb samples) followed by 48 and 120 (P1, P2). The 120 represents a significant regime shift/spike as we move towards spring. Given L=4, my mu_hat must cover L+1=5 periods. I will use the recent demand trend to forecast. Since demand appears to be accelerating, and the previous 5 samples were low (avg ~53), while the most recent is 120, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the upward trend (avg of 40, 48, 120 = 69.3 per period; mu_hat = 346.6). This higher mu_hat will trigger larger orders to build inventory for the spring season, though arrivals are still several periods away.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historically, demand has averaged around 52 units in Jan/Feb, but spiked to 120 in Period 2 (mid-Feb) before settling to 77 in Period 3. This suggest a potential start-of-season lift or high volatility within the 'Everyday Basics' category as spring approaches. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4). Since we haven't reached Period 5 yet, there are no 'conclude' messages for arrivals, which is normal. However, on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we have lost significant sales (demand has been 48, 120, and 77 while on-hand was 0). We have 242 units in transit (49+51+142). To capture the recent demand increase while balancing against the earlier lower samples, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5 takes the 5 samples provided plus the 3 game periods) and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock is high enough to recover from the current stockout once shipments arrive.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand shows a spike in Period 2 (120 units) followed by a decline (77, 39). The mean of the provided pre-game samples (78, 58, 47, 42, 40) is 53. The mean of the first 4 in-game periods is 71. Given the recent drop to 39, I suspect the P2 spike was an outlier or a temporary promotion. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed P1) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5 (this period). This arrival will be visible in the next 'conclude' message. Currently, on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 364 (49+51+142+122), which covers over 5 periods of average demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (P4 demand + 4 pre-game samples) to capture a more stable baseline of ~49 units per period. Since L=4, mu_hat should reflect (1+L)=5 periods of demand. I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent stable observations more heavily than the P2 spike.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Reviewing history: P1 order arrived in P5 (exact 4-period lead time). On-hand is currently 0 with 340 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Recent demand shows a significant spike in P2 (120) but settled back to a range of 39-77 in subsequent periods. Average demand over the last 5 samples is 67.8. Given the promised lead time (L=4), we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Total expected demand for 5 periods is ~339 units. Current pipeline (340) roughly covers this, but we have 0 on-hand and have been stocking out. I will use a conservative forecast since the P2 spike (120) might be an outlier or early seasonal peak. Using N=5 for mu_hat captures the recent mean (67.8 * 5 = 339) while the sigma_hat needs to account for the P2 volatility. Setting L to default (4) as confirmed by the P1 arrival.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598001 (Nora T-shirt) is a basic women's jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand was stable around 40-50 units until Period 2 (2019/2/18), which saw a sharp spike to 120, followed by a settling period (77, 39, 55, 47). As we move into late March (Period 7), demand typically stabilizes for basics before spring peaks. Arrival data confirms the promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is low (4) but in-transit is high (349), consisting of orders from P3 (142), P4 (122), P5 (25), and P6 (60). The P3 order (142 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 7. Setting L to default (4). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the stabilization after the early February spike, averaging ~67.6 per period. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility observed in the last five weeks compared to the earlier quiet period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Nora T-shirt', an everyday basic. Current date is April 1st. Historically, demand has fluctuated but shows no clear seasonal spike yet (samples: 78, 58, 47, 42, 40, 48, 120, 77, 39, 55, 47, 83). The mean of all 12 samples is ~62.3. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 55, 47, 83) averages ~61.6, suggesting stability around the long-term mean. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory is 254 (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), and on-hand is 63. Combined (317) covers roughly 5 periods of average demand (62.3 * 5 = 311.5). Since lead time is stable at 4, L=4 is appropriate. I will use the default method for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 as they encompass all available data, which provides a more robust estimate given the high variance observed in P2 (demand=120).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a women's jersey T-shirt, a basic item. Historical lead times for the first 4 orders have consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand samples show a significant spike in Period 2 (120 units) but have since stabilized to a mean of 56 over the last 4 periods (Periods 5-8). Given that this is a spring date (April), demand for T-shirts might slightly increase, but there's no strong evidence for a massive surge yet. I will set the lead time method to 'default' (4 periods). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the stabilized demand post-spike. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to reflect current volatility. The on-hand inventory (130) plus in-transit (167) equals 297 units, which currently covers roughly 5 periods of average demand, providing a safe buffer against the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as stable at 4 periods (observed across 4 arrivals). Demand regime stabilized around 56 units/period following a Period 2 spike.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), we observe the 5th consecutive arrival confirming a lead time (L) of 4 periods. The product is a women's jersey T-shirt, which is a staple basic. Demand historically spiked in Period 2 (120 units) but has since stabilized and exhibits a slight downward trend over the last three periods (55, 28, and current outlook). I am using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the post-spike demand stability (Period 3-9 mean approx 56 units) while smoothing out the extreme Period 2 outlier. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current period's lower volatility relative to the early game shock. Parameters target a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods. With 127 units on-hand and 175 in transit (covering Periods 6, 7, 8, 9), the pipeline is well-stocked against the current demand average of ~56/week.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' item. Since late February (Period 3), demand has stabilized, with recent observations (Periods 8-10) showing a slight decline (55, 28, 43). The seasonal peak from the initial seeding data (Jan 7: 78 units) and Period 2 (120 units) has passed. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on 6 consecutive arrivals (Periods 5-10). Total inventory (on-hand 144 + in-transit 125 = 269) is currently high relative to the mean demand of ~42 units over the last 3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the stabilization after the early-season spikes while maintaining the confirmed lead time L=4. This will likely result in lower order quantities to trim the excess on-hand inventory while maintaining a service level appropriate for a basic jersey item with $4 profit and $1 holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598001 (Nora T-shirt) is a basic women's item with stable lead times (confirmed at 4 periods). Demand spiked early in the season (Period 2), but has since stabilized. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 7-11) has averaged 50 units (83, 55, 28, 43, 41). Current inventory position is healthy with 150 on-hand and 104 in-transit (orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11). Given the current on-hand inventory is essentially covering 3 periods of average demand and total pipeline covers over 5, the OR backend's base-stock calculation will safely manage any minor fluctuations. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current stable regime rather than the early season spike, while maintaining the 'default' lead time of 4.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Nora T-shirt' is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' staple item. Analysis of recent demand (Period 9-12) shows a stable consumption rate of approx 38.25 units/period (43, 41, 41, 28-avg). This is lower than the earlier post-spike stabilization of 56 mentioned in carry-over insights. With the date entering May (2019/5/6), we expect seasonal relevance for t-shirts to remain high, though the current trend suggests a slight cooling or normalization from early spring spikes. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-12. Inventory levels are currently high (144 on-hand), exceeding the expected demand for the lead time duration (~191 units needed for L+1 covering demand of ~38). The pipeline inventory (105) plus on-hand (144) totals 249, which is more than enough to cover the lead time. Setting mu_hat to a more recent window (N=5) to capture the cooling demand trend and avoid overstocking while holding costs ($1) are relatively high compared to profit ($4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 9: Average weekly demand stabilized at approximately 38 units, down from the previous stabilization level of 56 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598001' (Nora T-shirt) is a basic summer item. Since the end of Period 9, the demand has entered a lower, stable regime after the initial spring peak. Period 9-13 demand values are 28, 43, 41, 41, and 31 (mean ~36.8). The current date is May 13, heading into the full summer season. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (1+L)=5 periods. Our on-hand (146) plus in-transit (72) equals a pipeline inventory of 218 units. With a mean demand of ~37, a 5-period requirement is approximately 185 units. Because 218 > 185 and the holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit (service level target ~80%), we are currently overstocked and the OR cap will likely prevent further ordering. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the current lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default lead time as it is stable.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's jersey t-shirt. Historical lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Since Period 9, the demand has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the initial surge. However, Period 14 (date May 13) showed a spike to 67 units, which may be a seasonal variation as we approach warmer weather. The on-hand inventory is 89 units with 62 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 11 and 12). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent stabilization and the sudden spike in Period 14, as N=5 covers Periods 10-14. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the latest week. For lead time ('L'), I will use 'default' as the promised 4 periods is perfectly stable in history.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Potential seasonal demand increase detected; Period 14 demand (67) is significantly higher than the previous 5-week average (39).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Nora T-shirt' is entering late May (2019/05/27), where we observe a clear seasonal surge. Demand in Period 14 (67) and Period 15 (87) is significantly higher than the previous 5-week average of ~39. This aligns with typical summer seasonality for a 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 28 units on-hand and 103 in-transit, protecting against this higher demand regime is critical to avoid stockouts during the lead time. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this higher-demand, higher-volatility tier (Avg demand ~62 over the last 3 weeks including the jump).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand surge for Jersey T-shirt confirmed: Demand increased from a 5-week average of 39 to an average of 77 over the last 2 periods (Periods 14-15), representing a ~97% increase.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. We are in a high-demand period for the 'Nora T-shirt', which coincides with the transition into summer. Average demand over the last 3 periods (Periods 14-16) is 68.3 units, compared to the spring average (Periods 9-13) of 36.8 units. Although Period 16 demand dropped to 51, this is still significantly higher than the spring baseline and likely represents natural volatility within a high-season regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The inventory position is tight: on-hand is only 13 units, and while the pipeline is 176 units, the next arrival (from Period 13) is 0 units, and the Period 14 order was also 0 units. This means we will face a significant stockout in the coming periods unless we maintain a high base stock to capture future arrivals. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to account for the summer surge and use explicit sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen during the Period 15 spike.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Average demand Periods 14-16 increased to ~68 units (+85% vs spring). Stockout risk imminent for Periods 17-18 due to zero orders placed in Periods 13-14.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18 (June 10). The product is a Nora T-shirt, a summer staple. Demand analysis shows a significant surge since Period 14 (average demand ~55 units/week) compared to the spring average (~39 units). Although Period 17 showed 35 units, we are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and missed potential sales. The '0' arrival in Period 17 is consistent with the '0' order placed in Period 13 (Lead Time = 4). We have 274 units in transit from orders placed in Periods 15 (67), 16 (109), and 17 (98). The first of these (67 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 19. I will continue to forecast for the elevated summer demand regime. I'm using L=4 (default) and mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the higher seasonal mean (~54 units/week) while smoothing out the Period 17 dip. sigma_hat is set using recent volatility to account for the current demand spikes.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime for the Nora T-shirt. Demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) has averaged 56.6 units, following a peak in May. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we are experiencing a stockout due to zero orders being placed in Periods 13 and 14. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The order placed in Period 15 (67 units) is expected to arrive in Period 19 resolution, and the order from Period 16 (109 units) in Period 20. To recover from the stockout and meet sustained summer demand, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and higher mean compared to the spring baseline. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) at the required service level (~80% given profit $4 vs holding cost $1).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598001 (Nora T-shirt) is in its peak summer season (late June). Demand has been volatile but high, with the most recent demand at 92 units (Period 19). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) due to a gap in ordering during Periods 13-14. However, the supply chain has normalized with the arrival of the Period 15 order in Period 19, confirming L=4 is stable. The pipeline inventory (255 units) consists of orders from Periods 16 (109 units), 17 (98 units), 18 (41 units), and 19 (7 units). The Period 16 order is expected to arrive in Period 20 (this period), and the Period 17 order in Period 21. Since the product is a summer 'Everyday Basic' and current demand is high, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the seasonal average. Over the last 6 periods (the summer surge), average demand is approximately 62.5 units. Using mu_hat with recent_N (N=6) will set the base stock to cover 5 periods of this higher demand (approx 312 units). Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), the OR backend will use the 80% service level to prevent excessive overstocking as we approach the end of summer.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Peak summer demand volatility confirmed. Average demand over the last 6 weeks (Periods 14-19) is 62.5 units, significantly higher than the spring baseline of 38 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand regime for the Nora T-shirt. Demand in Period 20 reached 131 units, the highest recorded to date. The last 4 periods (P17-P20) show an average demand of 75.25 units, significantly higher than the spring baseline of 38 units. Inventory levels are under extreme pressure; on-hand inventory has been zero or near-zero for the last four periods, resulting in substantial lost sales. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (current + 4 lead periods). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering the summer jump starting Period 14) to capture this higher mean and volatility. This should trigger an aggressive order to replenish the pipeline and meet the sustained summer demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand for Nora T-shirt is confirmed and higher than initially estimated; demand reached 131 in Period 20, with a 4-week average (P17-P20) of 75 units (+97% vs spring).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22 (July 8), the height of the summer season for the Nora T-shirt. Demand has surged significantly: the last 3 periods (P19-P21) recorded demands of 92, 131, and 142 units, respectively, with a 3-period average of 121.7 units. This confirms a much higher peak than the spring baseline (~38) or early summer average (~75). Despite recent arrivals (98 units in P21), we are stocking out because demand (142) exceeded arrivals. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 278 units in-transit (ordered in P18, P19, P20, P21). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand July window, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the most recent demand spike. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (P19-P21) captures this 121.7 average. Multiplying by (1+L) where L=4 gives (1+4) * 121.7 = 608.5. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the OR backend aims for this new volume, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: July Peak Demand Confirmed: Demand has escalated to an average of ~122 units/period (P19-P21), a significant increase over the early summer average of 75. Stockouts continue as demand outpaces scheduled arrivals.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598001' (Nora T-shirt) is in a peak summer demand regime. Demand over the last three periods (P20-P22) has averaged 135.3 units (131, 142, 133), significantly higher than the early summer average (~75) or spring average (~38). We are currently experiencing stockouts as demand exceeds on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are in the middle of July (2019/7/15), this high demand is expected to persist or slightly increase before tapering off in late August. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture this 'July Peak' and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time. This results in a higher base stock to recover from stockouts and meet the current high-velocity demand.

Carry-over insight: Peak July demand regime confirmed (Periods 20-22): Average demand has reached 135.3 units/period, representing an 80% increase over the early summer average of 75 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand period for the Nora T-shirt. Demand over the last four periods (P20-P23) has been 131, 142, 133, and 141, establishing a stable 'peak' regime with a mean of 136.75 units per period. The standard deviation in this peak regime is very low (~5 units), but I will use a slightly larger N for sigma to capture potential volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 540 units in transit following aggressive ordering to meet this peak. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%. Setting mu_hat to (1+L) * 137 ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that covers 5 periods of peak demand (approx 685 units). I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat to lock into this specific high-demand plateau.

Carry-over insight: Peak July demand regime confirmed (Periods 20-23): Average demand has reached 136.75 units/period with low volatility (std ~5).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. We are in the peak summer demand regime for the Nora T-shirt. Demand has stabilized at a very high level: over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand has been 131, 142, 133, 141, and 146, averaging approximately 139 units per period. The standard deviation across this peak regime is extremely low (~5.8), indicating a sustained and predictable surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 0 due to demand consistently exceeding recent arrivals, and we have a large pipeline (645 units) to cover the current stockout. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 695, which represents (1+L) * 139 (where L=4), to ensure the base stock target reflects the current peak demand level. Sigma_hat is set to 25 (approx sqrt(5)*11) to account for slight variability and maintain service levels during this high-demand window, which likely represents the peak of the summer season before a potential August tapering.

Carry-over insight: Peak July demand regime (Periods 20-24) confirmed: Average demand has reached 138.6 units/period with very low volatility (std ~6). Demand is consistently outstripping supply resulting in persistent stockouts.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598001 (Nora T-shirt) is in a peak summer demand regime. Historical demand for the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 143.8 units (142, 133, 141, 146, 157) with a slight upward trend. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * 144 to cover the high demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Despite large arrivals, persistent stockouts occur because previous orders were insufficient for this peak. Current 'In-transit' is 589 units, which includes orders from P22 (165), P23 (145), P24 (207), and P25 (72). The P22 order is expected to arrive in P26 resolution. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this peak regime specifically, as older data is no longer relevant for the current seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Peak summer demand regime (P21-P25) reached an average of 143.8 units/period (+278% vs spring baseline of 38). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598001' (Womens Nora T-shirt) is currently at the peak of its summer demand cycle. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P21-P26) shows demand ranging from 131 to 157, with an average of 142.5. Recent volatility is relatively low (std ~10). The system has finally cleared the stockout phase as of Period 26, with an ending inventory of 29 units and significant arrivals pending. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the date (August 12), we are likely at the tail end of the peak summer season; however, there is no evidence of a drop-off yet. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture this sustained high regime (N=6), and sigma_hat similarly to account for recent variance. This ensures base stock covers the (L+1) window of ~712 units (142.5 * 5). Pipeline inventory is currently 571 + 29 = 600, so a moderate order is expected to maintain the target service level.

Carry-over insight: Peak summer demand regime (P21-P26) stabilized at an average of 142.5 units/period. Stockouts resolved as of Period 26.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is currently in its peak summer demand regime. We have successfully resolved the stockout period as of Period 26, thanks to large orders placed during the peak and stable 4-period lead times. Demand in Period 27 was 118, slightly down from the previous week's 136 and the peak average of ~140. With the date being August 19, we are approaching late summer where demand for basics like jersey t-shirts often stabilizes before a potential seasonal decline in autumn. Over the last 7 periods (P21-P27), demand has averaged 139 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14. Setting N=7 for mu_hat captures this sustained high-demand regime while allowing for the slight tapering observed in the most recent periods. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Peak summer demand regime (P21-P27) observed average of 139 units/period. Demand showed signs of slight tapering in P27 (118) compared to the peak average.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are analyzing the 'Nora T-shirt', a summer-relevant item. Looking at the demand history, we had a peak summer regime from Period 21 to Period 28, with demand averaging approximately 139 units. However, Period 27 (118) and Period 28 (163) show high volatility as we approach the end of August. Typically, basic t-shirt demand starts to soften as the peak summer season concludes. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is currently 555 units, and our recent peak demand average (P21-P28) is ~142 units/period, we are well-covered for the next few periods. I will use a recent_N of 8 periods (covering the entire high-demand summer peak) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure we maintain enough stock for any late-August surges while allowing the policy to naturally scale down as lower demand samples eventually enter the window. This balances the risk of stockouts against the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. We are entering the transition from peak summer demand to the early autumn season for the 'Nora T-shirt'. Although recent demand remained very high (180 in Period 29), there is historical evidence of volatility and potential tapering as seen in Period 27. The product reached a stockout in Period 29 (sold 172 of 180 demand). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the 4-period lead time, we must maintain a robust pipeline. I will set mu_hat based on the recent peak demand regime (last 6 periods, P24-P29) which averages ~150 units/period, ensuring (L+1) coverage. This protects against the current high demand while the 5:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio justifies carrying inventory to avoid further stockouts during this high-demand tail of the summer season.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand surge: Period 29 saw a peak demand of 180 units, the highest in the history, extending the high-demand regime beyond the July peak (average P24-P29: 150 units).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are entering the post-summer transition for the Nora T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant peak in late August (180 units) followed by a decrease to 114 units in the most recent period. The 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 29-30 suggests demand is still high but exhibiting volatility as summer ends. I am setting mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (approx. P24-P30) to capture this high-demand regime while allowing for the recent tapering (Mean of P24-P30 is ~143 units). Looking at the calendar, demand usually begins to decline as autumn approaches, so staying slightly above the long-term summer average (which was ~138-142) but acknowledging the lower P30 demand is prudent. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand is low (33), but total in-transit is very high (588), which should cover upcoming needs as long as the parameters reflect current high-category velocity.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer transition: Demand peaked at 180 in P29 but dropped to 114 in P30. Average demand for the high-summer/late-summer block (P24-P30) is approximately 143 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

We are moving into mid-September (Period 32). The high-summer/late-summer peak is concluding. Demand has shown a downward trend over the last two weeks (114 in P30, 87 in P31) compared to the August average of ~150. Given the product is a 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics), demand is expected to settle into a more moderate early-autumn regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 75 units on hand and 608 in transit (largely from orders placed during the peak), we have sufficient pipeline inventory. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (covering P29-P31: 180, 114, 87) to capture the cooling demand trend while maintaining safety stock (sigma_hat) based on the recent volatility of this transition period.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand peak passed in P29; demand is currently on a downward trajectory (114 in P30, 87 in P31) as of 2019/09/09.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/09/23. We are observing the wind-down of the summer peak for the Nora T-shirt. Demand for the last three periods has been 114 (P30), 87 (P31), and 103 (P32). While demand spiked slightly in P32, the overall trend from the P29 high of 180 is downward as autumn approaches. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across the entire history. With 79 units on-hand and 525 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the peak), we are now at risk of overstocking if we continue to forecast at peak summer levels. I am setting L to 'calculate' to rely on the stable 4-period history. I am using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (covering P29-P32) to capture the cooling demand (average ~121 units) without over-reacting to the single P29 outlier, and recent_N of 4 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility during this transition period. This should help the OR engine reduce order sizes as the pipeline inventory is already very high relative to the tapering demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand taper confirmed: Average demand has decreased from the peak of 150+ to approximately 101 units over the last 3 periods (P30-P32). High pipeline inventory (525 units) necessitates lower order quantities to avoid excessive holding costs in autumn.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (September 30), we are firmly in a post-summer demand transition. Peak summer demand (P24-P29) averaged ~150 units, but recent demand (P30-P33) has moderated to an average of 104 units (114, 87, 103, 112). The product is a Nora T-shirt, which likely experiences lower demand in autumn/winter. Currently, on-hand inventory is 133 units and in-transit inventory is 437 units (total pipeline = 570 units). With lead time stable at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At the current mean of ~104, the required base stock is approximately 520 units. Since our pipeline (570) already exceeds this, the OR engine's capped policy will likely minimize or zero out new orders to prevent excessive holding costs as demand continues to taper. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this downward shift and use an explicit sigma_hat of 15 (per period) to reflect the moderate volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift confirmed (P30-P33): Average demand has dropped to 104 units/period from the peak of 150. Pipeline inventory remains high, necessitating a conservative ordering stance to avoid end-of-season overstock.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598001' (Nora T-shirt) is entering a post-summer/autumn demand decline as of October 14th. Following the peak late-August demand (180 units), demand has consistently decreased over the last six periods (P30: 114, P31: 87, P32: 103, P33: 112, P34: 83, P35: 64). The current on-hand inventory is 321 units and in-transit is 120 units (Total Pipeline = 441). Given the current demand level (~64 units), the existing stock covers approximately 6-7 periods, well beyond the L+1 window of 5 periods (Promised Lead Time L=4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high inventory levels relative to the declining demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to aggressively capture the downward trajectory (average ~86.3, compared to the P30-P35 average of ~94). This will prevent excess holding costs as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand decline confirmed (P31-P35): Average demand has dropped to 89.8 units/period, with the most recent sample at 64, signifying a clear exit from the summer peak regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is entering the late autumn season (October 21). Historical demand from recent periods (P31-P36: 87, 103, 112, 83, 64, 80) shows a stabilized decline following the summer peak, with an average of approximately 88 units per period over the last 6 weeks. The current on-hand inventory (265) plus in-transit stock (124) totals 389 units. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the current period, we must cover 5 periods of demand. At the current rate (~88/period), we require approximately 440 units of coverage. Our current pipeline (389) is slightly below this requirement. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this post-peak stabilization. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since demand is tapering as we move towards winter for a summer basic, I will maintain a standard sigma estimate to avoid over-ordering and high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Autumn stabilization confirmed (P31-P36): Demand has leveled off at approximately 88 units/period following the post-summer drop. This represents the new baseline as the product enters the Q4 period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 28, 2019. Demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' (a basic jersey item) has stabilized following the post-summer decline. Over the last 4 periods (P34-P37), demand has averaged 78.75 units (83, 64, 80, 88), confirming the autumn stabilization noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 255 and in-transit at 131 (total pipeline 386), the inventory position is healthy compared to the current demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand (covering the transition and stabilization from P31-P37) to capture this lower baseline while maintaining a safety buffer for typical 'basics' demand volatility. This helps the OR backend right-size the base stock to avoid excessive holding costs as we move further into Q4.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598001' (Nora T-shirt) is a basic summer item entering the late autumn/pre-winter season (November 4th). Historical demand analysis shows a clear transition: from a peak summer average of ~140-150 units, demand has consistently tapered through September and October. The current regime (Periods 35-38) shows demand samples of 64, 80, 88, and 49, averaging approximately 70.25 units per period. The recent drop to 49 in Period 38 suggests a further seasonal cooling as temperatures drop. Current inventory is high (On-hand: 206, In-transit: 216), which is sufficient to cover approximately 6 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and the downward seasonal trend, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand levels (recent_N=4) to prevent further overstocking while maintaining a buffer for late-season basics demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent levels to capture the reduced volatility of the post-peak season.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand decline: Demand dropped to 49 in Period 38, bringing the 4-week average to ~70 units, a ~20% decrease from the early October stabilization level of 88.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is entering late autumn/early winter (Nov 11), a period characterized by low demand for basic short-sleeve tees. Demand has confirmed a downward trend: Period 38 was 49 and Period 39 was 61, compared to the early October stabilization of ~88. The 4-week average (P36-P39) is approximately 69.5 units. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory (163) plus in-transit units (198, including an arrival of 28 units expected in Period 40) is 361 units. This pipeline is sufficient for over 5 periods of demand at the current rate (~70/period). To minimize high holding costs ($1.0/unit) against a relatively low profit margin ($4.0/unit) during this low-demand phase, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent decline, and use a conservative safety stock (sigma_hat) based on the same window.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand decline confirmed (P36-P39): Average weekly demand has dropped to ~70 units, a ~20% decrease from the early October level of 88.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, transitioning into late autumn/early winter. Significant demand decline is observed: Period 40 demand was just 28 units, and the average for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is ~57 units, down from the October average of 88. Historical evidence and seasonal trends for a jersey t-shirt suggest a continued low-demand regime as colder weather sets in. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 163, In-transit: 190) relative to this lower demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand phase, mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 5 to capture the latest downward shift (average 57.2), which translates to a mu_hat of ~286 for (L+1=5) periods. High current total inventory (353) compared to estimated base stock needs will likely result in the OR backend placing small or zero orders to draw down stock.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand regime (P36-P40) confirmed: Average demand has fallen to 57 units/period, a significant decrease from the early autumn stabilization level of 88 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The 'Nora T-shirt' is an everyday basic item, yet it shows significant seasonal decline as we approach winter. Demand has consistently decreased from the summer peak (150+) to a recent autumn average (P36-P41) of approximately 55 units/period. The most recent demand was 47 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 201 units and in-transit is 105 units (consisting of orders from P38 and P40), totaling 306 units of pipeline inventory. This inventory covers over 5 periods of demand at the current rate (~55/period). Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $4.0, the target service level is approximately 80%. With high existing stock and a continuing downward demand trend, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (P37-P41) to capture the late autumn decline, ensuring the backend logic doesn't over-order during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand stabilization: Average demand for Periods 37-41 has settled at 54.6 units per period, marking a clear reduction from the early autumn level of 88.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is the Nora T-shirt, a basic summer item. We are currently in Period 43 (Dec 2), moving deep into the low-demand winter season. Demand has stabilized at a late autumn baseline of ~55 units per period (P37-P42 average is 56 units). On-hand inventory is currently high at 222 units, which is approximately 4 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the current pipeline of 29 units, the total inventory position is 251 units, sufficient to cover demand for the next 4-5 periods without significant overstocking. My objective is to prevent excessive holding costs during this low-demand period while maintaining a basic safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P37-P42). Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P37-P42) confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a low-season baseline of ~56 units per period, a 36% decrease from the early autumn level of 88.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-137.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598001' (Nora T-shirt) is in a low-demand winter regime. Demand has significantly decreased from the summer peak (~150) and autumn stabilization (~88) to a winter baseline of approximately 56 units per period (Periods 37-42). Period 43 demand was exceptionally low at 17 units, but this should be treated as high-volatility noise rather than a new regime shift until more data is available. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 205 units with 97 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current mean of ~56, total requirement is ~280 units. Existing total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 302 units, which is slightly above the expected requirement. Therefore, the OR backend should aim for a minimal or zero order this period to allow inventory to naturally deplete towards the target base stock, minimizing holding costs ($1/unit/period) while maintaining the 80% service level implied by the profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P37-P42) confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a low-season baseline of ~56 units per period. Period 43 demand (17) indicates high late-season volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (2019/12/16), approaching the end of the game at Period 47. The product is a basic jersey T-shirt, which has moved through a clear seasonal cycle: a spring baseline (~38 units/period), a massive summer peak (~140 units/period), and a subsequent decline through autumn. Current demand (Periods 43-44) has dropped significantly to 17 units per period, indicating the low-season winter baseline or clearance phase. On-hand inventory is high at 208 units, and with in-transit inventory of 77 units (total 285 units), we are extremely overstocked relative to the current demand regime. With only 3 periods remaining (45, 46, 47), the current total inventory (285) far exceeds the total expected demand for the rest of the game (likely < 60 units). Holding costs ($1.0) are high relative to profit ($4.0), making inventory reduction the priority. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, meaning any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set based on the most recent 5-week demand regime (P40-P44) to allow the OR backend to see the low demand, though no new orders are desired.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand baseline shift confirmed (P40-P44): Average demand has dropped to 34.8 units/period, with the most recent two periods (P43-P44) at 17 units, indicating a late-December seasonal low.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, entering Period 46. We are in a late-winter/holiday demand regime for the 'Nora T-shirt', which has shown a significant drop to a baseline of approximately 34.8 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P40-P44) and even lower in the most recent periods (P43-P45: 17, 17, 21). On-hand inventory is high at 187 units, while in-transit inventory is 77 units (consisting of orders from P42 and P43). Given the low demand and high on-hand stock, the inventory position already exceeds the necessary base stock level for the promised lead time of 4. Orders placed in P39 and P41 were 0, and the P40 order arrived in P44. We expect the P42 and P43 orders to arrive in P46 and P47 respectively. To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand winter period, mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 5 to capture the current 35-unit/period average, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N of 6 to reflect the increased volatility observed in December.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on 2019-12-30, representing the year-end transition. Historically, this product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) experienced a significant demand drop during the winter season (Dec/Jan), with the most recent four periods (P43-P46) showing extremely low demand (17, 17, 21, 15). The average demand over the last 7 periods (P40-P46) is ~28.6 units, but the last 4 periods have stabilized even lower at ~17.5 units. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 181 units, which is enough to cover over 10 periods of current demand levels. With 68 units in-transit (ordered P43), total inventory is 249 units. Setting L to 'default' (4) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 captures the recent decline while remaining slightly conservative. This results in the OR backend generating a base stock level significantly lower than current inventory, effectively placing a zero order to draw down the surplus and minimize holding costs ($1.0/unit).

Carry-over insight: Winter seasonal low confirmed (P43-P46): Demand has dropped to a baseline of ~18 units/period, down from the late-autumn average of 57 units.
