Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS'. The product is a staple denim item. Looking at the five historical demand samples (65, 117, 162, 118, 146), there is a clear upward trend from early January, stabilizing around an average of 122 units per week. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using all 5 current samples (N=5) for the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) provides a balanced starting point. No lead time data is available yet, so we use the promised lead time of 4.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18) for SKU 448509001 (Slim Mom Denim TRS). In Period 1, we ordered 183 units, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, they are correctly 'In-transit' and not yet arrived. The inventory is currently 0, but the demand in Period 1 was 149. Looking at historical samples, demand has been increasing: 65, 117, 162, 118, 146, and finally 149 in Period 1. This suggests a relatively stable 'high' demand phase compared to the very beginning of the series. I will use the last 4 samples (including Period 1) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they represent the current demand regime better than the full history which includes the early low-growth phase. Since no orders have reached their promised lead time yet, I will use the default lead time (L=4).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a pair of slim mom denim trousers, which typically has steady demand but can see early spring uplifts. Historical demand (prior to Period 1) averaged ~121.6 units. Observations for Periods 1 and 2 show a higher demand regime of approximately 149-150 units. While the promised lead time is 4 periods, we have not seen any arrivals yet (expected given L=4). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the recent demand increase (mean of 162, 118, 146, 149, 150 is 145). Choosing recent_N for sigma_hat as well to capture recent volatility. L is set to default as we haven't reached the 4-period mark to verify actual lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is a denim trouser SKU. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (promised lead time is 4). Total units in transit (530) match the sum of orders from Periods 1-3 (183+175+172). Historical demand samples show a range of 65-162. Recent demand (last 8 samples including game history) averages ~125. Since spring seasonality often drives clothing demand in March/April, I will maintain a stable forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent patterns since the start of the simulation, while keeping the lead time at the promised 4 periods as no deviations can be confirmed yet (P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in P6).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a standard apparel item. Historical demand samples (Pre-game: 65, 117, 162, 118, 146; In-game: 149, 150, 115, 173) show a relatively stable mean around 133 units/week with a standard deviation of approximately 31. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 are currently in-transit (total 695 units). Following the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (183 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6 start). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales, which is expected during the initial lead-time window. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand (N=9, covering all pre-game and in-game samples) to stabilize the base stock calculation as we await the first arrival.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a pair of slim mom denim jeans, which generally sees steady demand with potential spikes as spring fashion purchases increase. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods was confirmed by the Period 1 order arriving in Period 5. However, since the on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we are facing high demand (225 in P5), we are experiencing stockouts. The in-transit inventory is 543 units, comprising orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5. Order P2 (175 units) is expected to arrive during Period 6. The demand has shown a significant jump recently: the initial 5 samples averaged ~121, but Period 5 hit 225. Because demand is trending upward as we enter spring (mid-March), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand (avg of 115, 173, 225 is 171) for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility. For the lead time L, I will use 'calculate' since the actual lead time of 4 matches the promised lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a pair of jeans. Historically, demand has been: 65, 117, 162, 118, 146 (pre-game) and 149, 150, 115, 173, 225, 166 (in-game). Recent demand shows a slight upward trend, particularly the spike to 225 in Period 5 (early March), likely reflecting spring seasonal interest in denim. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data from Periods 5 and 6 confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is low (9 units) with 630 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). We expect an arrival in Period 7 (from P3). Given the recent demand volatility and the spring season, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture the current demand level. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N helps adapt to the slightly higher demand observed since mid-February.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is 'Slim Mom Denim TRS'. Historical demand samples (last 5 available before game start + Period 1-7) show a mean of approximately 149 units. There was a significant spike in Period 5 (225 units) followed by a return toward the mean (166, 139). This suggests the demand is relatively stable but has high variance. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and observed lead times for orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 were exactly 4 periods. Current on-hand is 42, with 681 units in-transit (orders from P4-7). Since the OR Backend uses lead time L and the mean demand to calculate base stock, I will set L to 'calculate' based on the consistent historical performance. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the trend including the recent P5-P7 dynamics while smoothing the P5 spike. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the recent volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1, P2, P3 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). Demand remains centered around ~150 units despite a one-off spike in P5.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). Historical demand samples show values: 65, 117, 162, 118, 146 (pre-game) and 149, 150, 115, 173, 225, 166, 139, 261 (post-game). The demand shows significant volatility with peaks in Period 5 (225) and Period 8 (261), possibly due to spring seasonality for denim 'Mom' jeans and ankle-length styles. Average demand since Period 1 is approximately 172 units/period. The lead time is confirmed to be exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Regarding inventory: we have 0 on-hand and 644 in-transit. The OR backend uses a Base Stock policy: (1+L)*mu + z*sigma*sqrt(1+L). With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Current (1+L)*mu is approximately 860 units. Pipeline (644) is below this. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the slightly higher recent demand average (172 vs historical 121) caused by seasonality, and default sigma_hat to account for the high variance (std dev ~48).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing with spring season; average demand since P1 is 172 units (+42% vs pre-game avg of 121).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a 'Slim Mom Denim TRS' (jeans), which typically sees stable or slightly increasing demand during the Spring season. Historical demand shows a regime shift starting around Period 5 (March 11th); the pre-game mean was ~121, but the average from P1-P9 is ~170. Recent periods (P5-P9) show high volatility with a mean of 189.8 (225, 166, 139, 261, 158). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 867 units. However, we have experienced several stockouts (sold < demand) due to the demand shift. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime (approx 190 units/period) and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is set to approximately 950 units plus a safety buffer, which is necessary to recover from the stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 5: mean increased from ~121 to ~190 (+57%). Volatility has also significantly increased during this Spring period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/4/22). History confirms a lead time (L) of 4 periods. The product is a seasonal denim 'Mom' jean, which saw a demand regime shift around Period 5 (Spring). The mean demand from Period 5 to Period 10 is approximately 177 units (225, 166, 139, 261, 158, 115), compared to the pre-regime average of ~130. However, the last 3 periods specifically (P8-P10) have been highly volatile (261, 158, 115). Period 10's demand (115) was significantly lower, but the date (mid-late April) suggests we are still in a peak spring/summer season for jeans. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the post-shift regime (since Period 5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this increased volatility and higher mean compared to the very early periods. Pipeline inventory is healthy (784 in-transit), but with L=4, we must ensure we cover demand for Periods 11 through 15 (L+1).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late April (Period 12). The product is 'Slim Mom Denim Trousers', which fits a spring/summer wardrobe. Historically, we saw a demand surge in early March to early April (Periods 5-9), likely representing the peak of the spring transition. Recent demand (Periods 10 and 11) has dropped to 115 and 109 units respectively, suggesting the initial spring peak is tapering off. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 261, with 621 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, P11). In Period 12, P8's order (128 units) will arrive. Given the drop in demand, I am using a 'recent_N' approach (N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the cooling demand (mean ~160) rather than the all-time history or the higher peak mean. This prevents over-ordering as we move past the spring spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed post-Spring peak: Periods 10-11 averaged 112 units, significantly lower than the P5-P9 average of 191 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are observing a significant demand cooling following the Spring peak (Periods 5-9). The demand for the last three periods (P10: 115, P11: 109, P12: 84) has averaged roughly 103 units, which is much lower than the previous regime of ~191. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 305 units and in-transit at 548 units (Total Inventory = 853), we are currently overstocked relative to the new, lower demand level. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current downward trend and prevent the OR engine from ordering excessive inventory. This set of parameters will cause the OR policy to calculate a lower base stock, likely resulting in zero or minimal orders this period to burn off the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: P10-P12 average demand dropped to 103 units, a 46% decrease from the P5-P9 Spring peak average of 191 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). We are observing a significant downward trend in demand following the Spring peak (periods 5-9). The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has dropped from an average of ~191 units during the peak to an average of ~84 units over the last three periods (P11: 109, P12: 84, P13: 63). We have 496 units on-hand and 294 in-transit (orders from P10, P11, and P12), which is more than sufficient to cover the projected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Given the sharp decline in demand, I am using a recent 4-period window to capture this cooling trend and avoid over-ordering, while the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent excessive accumulation of inventory. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods (P10-P13) to reflect the new lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-Spring demand cooling confirmed: Demand dropped for 4 consecutive periods (P10-P13), with mean decreasing from ~191 to ~93 (-51%). Inventory levels are currently high due to laggard arrivals from the peak period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' has significantly cooled following the Spring peak (P5-P9). In the last five periods (P10-P14), demand has averaged 87.2 units, a 54% decrease from the previous regime. The current on-hand inventory is 610 units, which is approximately seven times the current weekly average demand. With an additional 115 units in-transit (due to orders in P11 and P12), we are significantly overstocked relative to the current sales velocity. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently realized across all visible arrivals. To minimize holding costs and prevent further inventory build-up, no new orders are required. The OR backend will be guided to reflect this lower demand regime by using recent data (N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the post-peak cooling trend.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late May (2019/5/27). Demand has cooled significantly from the Spring peak, stabilizing at a low level (average of 68 units over the last 5 periods: P11-P15). Current on-hand inventory is very high (611 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak demand phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given that the on-hand inventory (611) and remaining in-transit (55) far exceed expected demand for the next 5 periods (~340 units), the priority is to avoid ordering and minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime. The OR backend's capped policy will ensure no new orders are placed since on-hand + pipeline exceeds the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime established (P11-P15): Mean demand has decreased to ~68 units/period, down from the P5-P9 average of 191 units. High inventory surplus (~600+ units) exists relative to current demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 448509001 (Slim Mom Denim TRS) continues its downward trend following the Spring peak. Current demand at Period 16 (June 3rd) was 47 units, and the average for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is ~64 units. The 'On-hand' inventory is extremely high at 619 units due to orders placed during the peak demand phase (P6-P10) now having arrived. With no units in-transit and a promised lead time of 4 periods, we are effectively covered for nearly 10 periods of demand at the current rate (619 / 64). The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will correctly result in an order of 0 because on-hand inventory far exceeds the target base stock. I will update mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P11-P16) to capture this low-demand regime, ensuring our target level is realistic and doesn't trigger unnecessary ordering until the surplus is cleared. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (Early Summer) confirmed: P11-P16 mean demand is 71 units, showing stabilization at lower levels compared to Spring peak.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 448509001 (Slim Mom Denim) has entered a stable low-demand regime typical of the post-Spring season (June). The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P11-P17) is approximately 74 units, with the most recent sample at 40 units. Current on-hand inventory is 579 units, with zero in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current period (R=1), the target pipeline should cover roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current mean of ~74, the required base stock is approximately 370 units. Since current on-hand (579) significantly exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect this lower stabilization point and high stock levels, which will trigger the OR backend to place a zero order.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 19 (mid-June). Demand for denim trousers has continued a steady decline since the Spring peak, falling to a period-low of 30 units in Period 18. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is approximately 48 units. With 549 units currently on-hand and zero in-transit, we have approximately 11-18 periods of supply based on recent demand rates. This significant inventory surplus, relative to a holding cost of $1.0 vs. $4.0 profit (80% target service level), necessitates a complete halt in ordering to minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (the low-demand regime) to reflect this cooling trend, which will keep the OR backend's base stock well below our current on-hand levels, resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline continued: P15-P18 mean demand dropped to 44 units, a 45% decrease from the P11-P14 average of 80 units, confirming a deep summer low for this SKU.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a deep summer low. Demand has continued to decline, reaching a new low mean of approximately 34 units/period over the last 4 periods (P16-P19), compared to the previous low-regime average of ~71 units. The inventory level is currently extremely high (516 units), which represents approximately 15 periods of supply at current demand rates. There is no pipeline inventory. Given the $1.0/unit holding cost versus $4.0/unit profit, the target service level is approximately 80%, which is heavily exceeded by the current on-hand stock. No new orders should be placed until inventory levels align with demand. I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent deep-summer demand drop (34 units/period) and 'calculate' for the lead time which has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Deep summer season low confirmed: Periods 16-19 mean demand dropped to 37.5 units, a 47% decrease from the P11-P16 low-regime average of 71 units. Inventory remains in extreme surplus.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Slim Mom Denim TRS) has entered a deep summer demand trough. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is only 31.25 units, continuing a significant downward trend from the Spring peak (~191 units) and the subsequent low regime (~71 units). The current on-hand inventory of 494 units is extremely high relative to this demand, covering over 15 periods of the current run rate. Consequently, I will continue to order zero units. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect this most recent deep-summer demand regime (P17-P20), ensuring that the OR engine's base-stock calculation remains significantly below current inventory levels to prevent any premature reordering.

Carry-over insight: Deep summer demand trough intensified (P17-P20): mean demand further decreased to ~31 units, a 56% drop from the earlier low-regime average of 71 units.

Demand has established a very low regime, with the most recent 4-week average (P18-P21) being 31 units per week. This confirms the deep summer trough identified in carry-over insights. Currently, the SKU has an extreme inventory surplus of 455 units on-hand with zero in-transit, which covers more than 14 weeks of demand at the current average rate. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, minimizing further holding costs is paramount. I am setting parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (recent_N where N=4) and maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The goal is to allow the OR backend to continue suppressing orders until the massive on-hand surplus is naturally depleted.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the middle of summer. Historically, demand for these slim mom denim trousers peaked in spring (P5-P9) and hit a deep trough in June/early July (P17-P20). However, Period 22 shows a significant jump in demand to 97 units, up from the P17-P20 average of ~31 units. This could indicate the start of a late-summer recovery or back-to-school interest. Despite this spike, on-hand inventory is 358 units, which is still extremely high (covering over 3.5 periods of the spiked demand). Total pipeline inventory is 0. The OR backend will naturally zero out any orders because the current stock far exceeds the calculated base stock level for any reasonable forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the recent spike without overreacting, as 358 units on hand provides a massive safety buffer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 22 (97 units), potentially ending the deep summer trough (P17-P20 avg ~31 units).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late July (2019/7/22). History shows a clear rebound in demand over the last two periods (P22: 97, P23: 91), compared to the deep summer trough (P17-P20 average: 31). This confirms a demand regime shift upwards as we approach the late-summer/back-to-school transition. Mean demand over the last two periods is 94 units. Current on-hand inventory is 267 units with zero in-transit. With a 4-period lead time, we must plan for 5 periods of demand (Period 24-28). At the current rate of ~94 units/period, 5 periods would require ~470 units. Since on-hand is only 267, we are at risk of a stockout in roughly 3 periods if the trend continues. I will use recent_N=2 to capture this immediate upward shift for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Although the OR backend uses a capped policy, setting N=2 will signal the need for a new order to arrive in 4 periods to replenish the depleting stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound confirmed: Periods 22-23 mean demand increased to 94 units, a 200% increase over the P17-P20 trough (31 units), signaling the end of the summer low and the start of a late-summer/pre-autumn recovery.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Slim Mom Denim TRS) is moving out of its deep summer trough (P17-P20 average: 31) into a late-summer/pre-autumn recovery phase. Period 22-23 showed a strong rebound with demand averaging 94 units, though Period 24 dipped slightly to 65. The overall trend for the last three periods (P22-P24) is a mean of 84.3 units, signaling a significantly higher regime than the previous two months. We are currently in late July (2019/7/29), transitioning into August, which typically sees the start of 'back-to-school' or 'early autumn' shopping for denim jeans. Current on-hand inventory is 202 units with 101 in-transit (reaching us in P28). I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this rebound while remaining responsive. L is maintained at the confirmed lead time of 4. This setup ensures that the total pipeline (order + on-hand + in-transit) covers the expected demand during the lead time plus current period, targeting a return to a stable stock position as the excess summer inventory has finally been depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from summer trough sustained: Periods 22-24 mean demand is 84 units, a 170% increase from the P17-P20 trough (31 units).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August 2019. We have confirmed a demand rebound following the deep summer trough (P17-P20 avg ~31 units). The demand for the last four periods (P22-P25) has been 97, 91, 65, and 79, averaging approximately 83 units. This suggests a transition into an 'End of Summer/Pre-Autumn' regime where denim sales typically begin to climb. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. Pipeline inventory is currently 214 units (orders from P24 and P25), and on-hand inventory is 123. Given the profit and holding cost (4:1), the target cycle service level is 80%. I am transitioning to 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=4 to capture this new regime shift without being overly influenced by the extremely low June/July numbers. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while beginning to build stock for the anticipated autumnal increase in trousers/jeans demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is showing a clear recovery from the deep summer trough (which averaged ~31 units). Over the last five periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 90.4 units, with the most recent observation at 120 units. This suggests we are entering an autumn ramp-up period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is critically low (3 units) because no orders were placed between Periods 13 and 23 due to an inventory surplus from a previous demand regime shift. Orders placed in P24, P25, and P26 (totalling 319 units) are in transit and will begin arriving in Period 28. To bridge this gap and meet the rising demand, I am using a recent_N strategy for mu_hat with N=5 (P22-P26) to capture the current recovery trend, translating to a forecast of (1+L)*90.4 = 452 units. I'm using recent_N for sigma_hat as well to account for the increased volatility seen during this transition. This approach aims to restore inventory levels to meet the higher autumn demand while being mindful of holding costs ($1/unit).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery confirmed: P22-P26 mean demand is 90 units, a 190% increase from the summer trough (31 units).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late August/early September 'Back to School' peak. Demand spiked significantly in Period 27 (182 units), which supports the 'Autumn demand recovery' identified in the carry-over insights. However, the system is currently stocked out at on-hand (0 units) because the rebound occurred while we were depleting excess summer inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders placed in P24 (101 units) are due to arrive in Period 28's arrival phase, but since that happens after this decision, we must ensure the parameters account for the current pipeline and the surging demand. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=6, covering P22-P27) to capture the accelerating trend (avg ~105 units/period) rather than the long-term historical mean. This higher mean will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that prioritizes replenishment during this seasonal upswing.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Period 27 demand reached 182 units, the highest in 19 periods, indicating a seasonal peak likely related to 'Back to School' shopping for denim trousers.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a high-demand Autumn/Back-to-School phase as confirmed by Period 27 (182 units) and Period 28 (158 units) demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P24 order arrived in P28). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 506 units in-transit. The orders from P25 (113), P26 (105), P27 (125), and P28 (163) are expected to arrive in Periods 29, 30, 31, and 32 respectively. Current demand is significantly higher than the previous summer lows. I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this surge (averaging ~120-130 units per period over P26-P28) without over-reacting to the single P27 peak of 182. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated seasonal demand while accounting for the high volatility seen in the transition from summer to autumn.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand peak sustained: Periods 27-28 mean demand is 170 units, a 89% increase from the early-autumn recovery average (P22-P26) of 90 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-02, which marks the peak of the Autumn/Back-to-School season for denim trousers. Recent demand (P27-P29) has averaged 151.3 units, significantly higher than the previous recovery average of 90 units. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand=0) despite consistent arrivals because demand has outpaced the earlier recovery-based orders. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With stockouts occurring, the observed demand likely under-represents true latent demand; however, P29 showed a slight dip to 114 from 158/182. Given the seasonal peak, I will use a 5-period average (P25-P29) to set mu_hat. This window captures the full ramp-up and current peak levels (~130 units/period). This aggressive mu_hat, combined with an explicit L=4 (standard lead time), will prompt the OR backend to place larger orders to recover from the current stockout state and meet sustained high autumn demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand peak confirmed: Periods 27-29 demand averaged 151 units, representing a sustained high-demand regime (+68% vs P22-P26 recovery mean). Stockouts in P27-P29 confirm that demand is exceeding current supply levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Slim Mom Denim TRS) is in a high-demand Autumn/Back-to-School regime. Demand over the last 4 periods (P27-P30) has averaged 154.75 units, significantly higher than the previous recovery phase. We have experienced stockouts for the last four consecutive periods (P27-P30) because demand is exceeding the arrived supply. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a large pipeline of 624 units (including orders from P27-P30), we need to maintain a high base stock to capture this peak demand while the OR backend manages the safety stock and ordering caps. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current high-demand mean (~155 units/period), which translates to a total demand of ~775 over the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also updated using N=4 to account for the increased volatility during this peak season.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data (Period 27-31) confirms a sustained autumn/back-to-school demand peak for denim trousers. The average demand over these last 5 periods is 150.8 units, a significant increase from the summer trough (~31) and the early recovery (~90). Despite regular arrivals with a consistent lead time of 4 periods (as confirmed by the P24-P27 orders), on-hand inventory remains at 0 due to demand exceeding supply. Pipeline inventory is currently 702 units, consisting of orders from P28 (163), P29 (205), P30 (131), and P31 (203). To maintain service levels during this high-demand regime and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent mean of ~151 units across the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this specific peak regime while avoiding the influence of the prior summer lows.

Daily Reward (R_t): $507.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September, a high-demand period for denim trousers following the 'Back-to-School' peak. Since Period 27, demand has stabilized at a high level, with an average of 148 units/period (P27-P32). The on-hand inventory is low (29 units), and although there is a significant pipeline (642 units), recent demand has consistently resulted in stockouts or very low ending inventory until Period 32. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sustained high volume observed over the last 6 periods, I will use a recent_N (N=6) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this higher autumn demand regime while acknowledging the significant pipeline of orders already placed (including the P29 order of 205 units arriving next period and the P30 order of 131 units arriving the week after). This will ensure the base stock is high enough to meet demand without over-ordering relative to the existing in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: P27-P32 mean demand is 148 units/period, confirming a sustained high-demand phase following the summer trough (+377% vs summer low of 31 units).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn/Back-to-School high-demand phase. Period 33 observed a significant demand jump to 275 units, though the average for the current regime (P27-P33) stands at approximately 166 units per period. Despite large arrivals, the system is still experiencing frequent stockouts (on-hand is 0) because current demand exceeds the forecast calculated by the OR backend. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 captures this entire high-demand regime (P27-P33) more accurately than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_7' to reflect the increased volatility observed during this peak season. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock level that accounts for 5 periods of demand (L+1), helping to build safety stock and mitigate the recent stockout trend.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Period 33 demand reached 275 units, significantly above the previous regime average of 148 units. The P27-P33 average is now 166 units (+84% vs autumn recovery mean).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a high-demand autumn peak. Period 33 saw a massive demand spike (275 units), and although Period 34 demand returned to 134 units, we are still seeing stockouts (sold 131 of 134 units demanded). The 'on-hand' inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 676 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the start of the autumn regime in Period 27, mean demand has stabilized around 162 units/period (P27-P34). I will use N=8 (the length of this regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current seasonal behavior better than the long-term average. The OR backend will see the high pipeline and current zero stock and calculate the necessary order to maintaining service levels for the remainder of this peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $347.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 36 (mid-October). Historical analysis shows a strong 'Back-to-School' and Autumn recovery demand regime starting around Period 27. Demand has averaged 160 units over the last 9 periods (P27-P35), though we saw a massive spike in P33 (275 units) followed by a return to more moderate levels around 110-130 units. The most recent demand (P34-P35) suggests the peak may be plateauing. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current 'In-transit' is quite high (703 units) relative to recent demand, as large orders from the P31-P35 window (totaling 906 units) are scheduled to arrive over the next 4 periods. With 93 units on hand and 703 units in the pipeline, current inventory position is 796 units. Calculating \u03bc\u0302 using a recent_N of 9 (capturing the entire Autumn regime P27-P35) gives an average demand of 156.3 units/period, which across L+1 (5 periods) requires a coverage of ~781 units. Our current pipeline and on-hand (796 units) essentially covers this. The OR backend will likely order a small amount or nothing based on the cap and base stock calculations, which is appropriate given the high stock currently en route and the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 vs $4.0).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School regime (P27-P35) mean demand is ~156 units, a significant increase from the summer recovery phase (~90 units). Demand volatility remains high (\u03c3 \u2248 47), but the most recent 2 periods suggest a potential stabilization or slight decline from the late September peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. The Autumn/Back-to-School peak that started around P27 (avg ~156 units) is showing signs of cooling. Demand in the last three periods (P34-P36) was 134, 110, and 79, suggesting a downward trend as we move further into October. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 117, with a very large pipeline of 681 units (orders from P33 to P36). The pipeline covers several weeks of peak-level demand. To avoid excessive overstocking as demand cools towards the end of the year, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the autumn average (~150 units) while acknowledging the recent volatility, but the OR backend's cap mechanism will likely limit further ordering given the massive pipeline inventory (681 units) relative to the current on-hand (117) and cooling demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed post-Autumn peak: Periods 34-36 reveal a downward trend (134, 110, 79), signaling the end of the Back-to-School high-demand regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Perrie Slim Mom Denim) has exited its Autumn/Back-to-School peak and is now in a cooling phase as we approach late October. Demand over the last four periods has trended downwards: 134, 110, 79, and 93, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 104 units. This is a significant drop from the peak average of ~160. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory health is improving with on-hand units now at 140 and a substantial pipeline of 611 units (ordered during the high-demand phase). Given the current cooling trend and high pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand levels (N=4) to prevent further overstocking as we enter what historically looks like a lower-demand late-autumn/winter transition for this item.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed post-Autumn peak: P34-P37 mean demand is 104 units, a 33% decrease from the P27-P33 peak average of 156 units. Supply is now catching up with high pipeline inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4th, 2019. We have observed a cooling trend following the Autumn 'Back to School' peak (P27-P34). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P35-P38) have averaged ~104 units, compared to the peak's average of ~156 units. The product description ('Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS') suggests a staple item that may see further demand softening as we move into late autumn, before potentially picking up for the holiday season. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 261 units, and there is a substantial pipeline of 357 units (ordered P35-P37) scheduled to arrive over the next few periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) captures the recent cooling trend (avg ~110), preventing further overstocking while maintaining a buffer for potential holiday demand shifts. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the OR backend will target a ~80% service level, which is appropriate for this stabilize-and-wait phase.

Carry-over insight: Post-Autumn cooling regime (P35-P38): Mean demand has decreased to ~104 units, a 33% drop from the Autumn peak (P27-P34) average of 156 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a post-autumn cooling phase. Since Period 35, demand has decreased, with the last four periods averaging ~92 units (110, 79, 93, 133, 64 - specifically P35-P39 avg is 95). The current date is Nov 11, moving into late autumn/early winter. Historically, after the 'back-to-school' and early autumn peak (P27-P34), demand for this denim SKU has shown a downward trend. We are currently holding 427 units on-hand with 127 in-transit (P36: 81 units, P37: 46 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand regime (~5x weekly demand), the goal is to avoid further accumulation while maintaining a safety buffer. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the cooling period) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility. This should result in zero or minimal new orders as the system works through existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-Autumn demand cooling (P36-P39) confirmed: Average demand dropped to ~92 units, down from the Autumn peak (P27-P34) average of 156 units. Inventory surplus established.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a post-autumn cooling phase as of Period 41 (Nov 18). Demand has significantly dropped from the autumn peak (P27-P34 avg: 156) to a more recent stabilized level. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is ~65 units (79, 93, 133, 64, 55). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is very high at 453 units, with 46 units still in transit arriving in Period 41. Total available inventory (499 units) is significantly higher than the projected total demand over the lead time plus review period (5 periods * ~65 units = 325 units). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent 5-period average (recent_N=5) and sigma_hat similarly to account for recent lower volatility. L is set to calculate as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Post-Autumn cooling regime (P36-P40) confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at ~65 units/period, down from the Autumn peak average of 156 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear post-Autumn cooling regime that has further decelerated. Over the last 4 periods (P38-P41), demand has been 133, 64, 55, and 48, averaging 75 units. This follows the late-Autumn peak (P27-P34) which averaged 166 units. With on-hand inventory at 451 units and no units currently in-transit, the inventory coverage is approximately 6 periods based on recent demand. Given the game is approaching its end (Period 42 of 47) and lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 46, leaving only one more period of sales. The extreme surplus ensures all remaining demand from Period 42 to Period 47 will be met without further ordering. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (P36-P41) to reflect the low-demand late-Autumn/early-Winter regime, which will result in no new orders being generated due to the high on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Late-Autumn/Winter demand stabilization: P36-P41 mean demand is ~62 units, a 60% decrease from the Autumn peak (P27-P34) average of 156 units. Inventory surplus is sufficient to cover remaining game periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), a massive demand spike of 274 units occurred, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales. This spike significantly depleted the inventory surplus that had accumulated during the post-Autumn cooling phase. Despite this spike, with only 5 periods remaining in the game (P43-P47) and 177 units on-hand, we have enough stock to cover approximately 3 periods of the current high-demand spike (274) or much longer if demand reverts to late-autumn averages (~62 units). However, given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P43) would only arrive in P47, the final period. The OR backend's cap mechanism will naturally limit ordering if we use recent demand statistics. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (covering the cooling period and the recent spike) to provide the backend with a realistic mean demand (approx 92 units/period) while accounting for the high volatility caused by the spike. This ensures we don't over-order at the end of the game while maintaining some protection if the sales momentum continues into December.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike in Period 42 (274 units) confirmed as a seasonal event (Black Friday/Cyber Monday), temporarily interrupting the late-autumn cooling regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44, with 4 periods remaining in the game (44, 45, 46, 47). On-hand inventory is 69 units, and 239 units are in transit. Period 42 saw a major demand spike (274 units) likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, followed by 108 units in Period 43. Excluding the holiday peak, the recent baseline demand (P36-P41) was approximately 62 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 239 units is composed of orders from P42 (2 units) and P43 (237 units). With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, these will arrive in P46 and P47 respectively. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 308 units. Against an expected non-peak demand of ~60-80 units per period, this total quantity is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods of the game (4 * ~70 = 280), even accounting for moderate buffer. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a conservative level based on the recent pre-spike average (N=6, P36-P41) to avoid triggering unnecessary last-minute orders that would incur holding costs at the game's end.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47, meaning only two order cycles remain (P45 and P46) that can realistically result in sales before the game ends, given the lead time of 4. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand recently spiked due to a seasonal event (P42: 274, P44: 163), which depleted the inventory surplus. We have 467 units in-transit (ordered in P42, P43, P44). The P42 order (2 units) and P43 order (237 units) are scheduled to arrive in P46 and P47 respectively. However, those arrivals occur *after* the demand resolution of those periods. Effectively, the units ordered in P42 arrive during P46 (available for P47 demand), and units from P43 arrive during P47 (the final period). Because current on-hand is 0, we will face stockouts in P45. To maximize reward in the final periods, we must ensure the backend provides enough base stock to cover remaining cycles. The recent demand regime (P42-P44) has averaged ~181 units, which is much higher than the previous cooling phase. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect this holiday/winter spike and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility seen in P42.

Carry-over insight: Winter seasonal peak confirmed: Periods 42-44 mean demand increased to 181 units, up from the late-autumn average of 62 units (+192%), driven by Black Friday and December holiday shopping.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), currently experiencing a Winter/Holiday peak demand regime (Black Friday through Christmas). Since Period 42, demand has spiked significantly, with recent samples of 274, 108, 163, and 169. The mean demand for this recent regime (P42-P45) is approximately 178.5 units. In-transit inventory is 712 units, consisting of orders from P42 (2 units), P43 (237 units), P44 (228 units), and P45 (245 units). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, the P42 order (2 units) should arrive during Period 46 (visible in P47 conclude), and the larger P43-P45 orders will arrive between Periods 47-49. At the start of Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0. Previous stockouts in P44 and P45 occurred because the pipeline had not yet arrived. The backend OR logic will target a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods. Using N=4 for mu_hat captures the recent holiday elevated demand (~178.5 units/period), and L=4 reflects the stable historical performance. The high pipeline (712) relative to the expected base stock (approx (4+1)*178.5 = 892.5) suggests the OR backend will place a moderate order to sustain stock for the final period (P47).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P45) mean is ~179 units/period, roughly 3x the preceding late-autumn average of 62 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (2019/12/30). A holiday demand peak (P42-P46) has been confirmed, with an average demand of approximately 167 units/period, significantly higher than the preceding late-autumn average of ~62. Period 46 saw a stockout as demand (123) exceeded available arrival (2 units from P42). The pipeline inventory is very high (1003 units) due to aggressive ordering during the peak (P43-P46). Given lead_time=4, these orders will begin arriving in P47 and P48, which are the final periods of the game. For P47, I'll set parameters to reflect the recent high-demand holiday regime (N=5 for P42-P46) to ensure the backend is calibrated correctly, but the system will likely place a zero or near-zero order because on-hand+pipeline (1003) far exceeds the expected consumption for the remaining duration. L is set to calculate as the observed lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P46) stabilized at ~167 units/period, a ~170% increase over the late-autumn baseline of 62 units.
