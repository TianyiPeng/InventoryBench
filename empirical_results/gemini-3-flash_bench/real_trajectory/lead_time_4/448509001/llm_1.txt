Historical data from Jan/Feb shows demand ranging between 65 and 162, with an average of (~121). Specifically, recent weeks were: 117, 162, 118, 146. The average of these four is 135. Given a promised lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (L+1 = 5 periods) because an order placed now arrives in P5 to satisfy demand after the P5 decision. Total demand to cover: 5 periods * 135 units/period = 675 units. I currently have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. To build a safety buffer for the high-end variance observed (up to 162) and account for the 4-week lead time, I will order a total of 750 units to establish the pipeline.",

Dates (late Feb) suggest a moving into the spring season in many regions. Demand Analysis: Historical data from Jan/early Feb showed an average of 121.6 units. Current observed demand in Periods 1 and 2 is very consistent at 149 and 150 units, suggesting a higher baseline than early Jan. I will project demand around 150 units/period. Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 and 2 are in-transit (Total: 1350). Period 1's order (750) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (1 + 4). Period 2's order (600) is expected in Period 6 (2 + 4). Inventory Position: On-hand is 0, meaning we are currently stocking out. With lead time L=4, my current decision (Period 3) covers demand for Period 7. To calculate the needed pipeline: Target = (Demand * (L + 1)) + Safety Stock. Target = (150 * 5) + 150 = 900 units. My current pipeline (in-transit) is 1350 units, which already covers the next 9 periods (1350 / 150 = 9). However, because I have 0 on-hand and 1350 in-transit for future periods, I must ensure I don't over-order. The 1350 in-transit is significantly higher than the 5-period requirement (750). I will place a 0 order this period to avoid excessive holding costs, as the existing pipeline of 1350 units (arriving P5 and P6) is more than sufficient to cover demand through P7 and beyond.",

We are currently in Period 42 (Nov 25), leading directly into the Black Friday and December holiday peak. Recent demand has been low (48-64 units), which mirrors the 'November lull' observed in our previous insights. However, based on the retail calendar and the SKU's high-demand history (peaking at 275 in Sept and 261 in April), a significant spike is anticipated for December. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Orders placed today (P42) will arrive in Period 46, which is near the end of the simulation (total periods = 47). We currently have 361 units on-hand and 450 units in-transit (P39, P40, P41 orders of 150 each). Expected arrivals: P39 order (150) in P43, P40 order (150) in P44, and P41 order (150) in P45. This puts 811 units into the pipeline for the remaining 6 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the fact that we are approaching the final periods, I will stop ordering to avoid excessive ending inventory, as the current pipeline (811 units) is sufficient to cover an average demand of 135 units/period for the rest of the game, which is a safe buffer for the expected holiday spike.",

Historical analysis shows a massive demand spike in Period 42 (Nov 25) of 274 units, which coincides with the Black Friday/Cyber Monday retail event. World knowledge suggests denim is a popular gift and self-purchase item leading into the Christmas holiday. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since it is now early December, we must prepare for the peak holiday shopping period in mid-to-late December (Periods 45-46). My current inventory is low (87 units) due to the Black Friday spike. Looking at the pipeline: the order from P39 (150 units) is expected to arrive in P43, P40 (150 units) in P44, and P41 (150 units) in P45. Given the recent demand of 274 and the likelihood of sustained holiday demand (likely 150-250 per week), the pipeline has 450 units coming in. However, to ensure we don't stock out during the final Christmas rush (lead time + 1 period), I need to maintain a higher safety stock. Period 47 is the end of the game, so orders placed now will arrive in Period 47 (the final resolution phase).

Based on the 2018/2019 retail calendar, we expect sustained high demand through the end of December (Periods 44-46) before a sharp drop in January. Target inventory for the 5-period window (L+1 = 5) should account for a holiday baseline of ~150-200 units per week. Total pipeline requirement (On-hand + In-transit) is approximately 800-900 units to avoid stockouts during the peak. Current status: On-hand = 129, In-transit = 450 (from orders in P40, P41, and P43). Expected arrivals: P44: 150 (P40 order), P45: 150 (P41 order), P46: 0, P47: 150 (P43 order). There is a gap in P46 arrivals. Since the game ends at P47 and shipments take 4 periods, any order placed now (P44) will arrive in P48 (after the game ends). Therefore, placing an order now will only incur potential holding costs or be irrelevant if it arrives after P47. However, looking at the in-transit, we have 450 units. Orders from P40 (150), P41 (150), and P43 (150) total 450. The pipeline is set for arrivals in P44, P45, and P47. I will place a final safety order of 100 units to ensure no stockout in the final period (P47) if demand exceeds the arriving 150 units, though the lead time of 4 means this arrives at P48. Re-evaluating: P44 decision arrives P48. Since the game ends at P47, ordering now has zero effect on availability during the simulation.

The product (Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS) typically sees strong demand during retail peaks. With a lead time of 4 periods, an order placed today (P45) would arrive in P49. However, the simulation likely ends at P47 (as indicated by 'Period 45 / 47'). Even if it continues short-term, we must evaluate the pipeline: On-hand = 116, In-transit = 300 (P41: 150, P43: 150). Expected arrivals: P45 (from P41) = 150; P47 (from P43) = 150. Based on the recent holiday average of ~180: P45 demand coverage (116 OH + 150 Arrival = 266) is sufficient. P46 demand (approx 180) leaves ~86 OH. P47 arrival (150) plus OH (86) gives 236 to cover P47 demand (~180).

Given the date is Dec 23rd, we are at the zenith of the holiday season, but must also anticipate the post-holiday January drop-off seen in early history (Jan demand was approx 65-162). Our current on-hand inventory is 97 units. In-transit inventory consists of 150 units ordered in P43, which is expected to arrive in P47 (next period) based on the consistent 4-period lead time. This gives us a projected total coverage of 247 units for the next few periods. Since lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Periods 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50. Total expected demand for this 5-period window (transitioning from Holiday peak to January baseline) is estimated at roughly 550 units (assuming ~150 for P46, then a taper to ~100/period for Jan).

Historically, January demand (observed in early Game History P1-P4 and the initial 2019 data) showed values ranging from 65 to 162, with a mean around 110-120.
