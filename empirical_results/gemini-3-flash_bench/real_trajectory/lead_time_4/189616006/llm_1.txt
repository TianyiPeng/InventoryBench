  "rationale": "Product 189616006 is 'Leggings in extra sturdy jersey', a staple basic item. Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a significant upward trend: 37, 95, 121, 153, 145. The average of the last three weeks is ~140 units. As we are currently at Period 1 (Feb 11), we are moving into the spring season in the Northern Hemisphere, where heavy jersey leggings remain relevant but basic demand typically stabilizes. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My decision for Period 1 must cover demand for the current period PLUS the lead time (Total = 5 periods). Calculating an expected demand of ~145 units/period for 5 periods equals 725 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I need to place a large initial order to establish a pipeline and safety stock. I will order 750 units to account for the current demand trend and ensure stock availability given the 4-period lead time delay.",

Demand Regime: Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows 37, 95, 121, 153, 145, and Period 1 demand was 135. This suggests a stable demand regime averaging around 120-140 units/week for early spring.

Demand is being lost until the first shipment arrives. Total pipeline (750) covers roughly 5.5 weeks of demand (~135 * 5.5 = 742).

My current in-transit (750) covers this window.

These are staple items but exhibit a strong seasonal uptick in early spring (Feb-Mar) as evidenced by the historical data and game history. Historical demand began at 37/week (Jan 7) and escalated to 145/week (Feb 4). Game history shows this trend continuing aggressively: Period 1 demand was 135 and Period 2 jumped to 191 (+41%). We are currently in late February (Feb 25), entering peak spring demand. Inventory status is critical: we have 0 on-hand and have lost 326 units of demand in two periods. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the Period 1 order (750 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5, and the Period 2 order (150 units) in Period 6. Currently, we have 900 units in transit. Given the demand growth rate, I estimate demand for Periods 3-7 will average approximately 220-250 units/period. Total demand for the pipeline coverage (L+1 = 5 periods) is roughly 1,150 units.

  "rationale": "Product 189616006 is a 'Heavy jersey legging', which is highly seasonal. We are currently at Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). Analyzing recent demand: P42 saw a significant spike to 129 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday (late November), compared to the previous four-period average of ~54. History from Period 1 (starting Feb 2019) showed demand around 135-140, suggesting that as we head into winter, demand returns to these higher levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My pipeline consists of 197 on-hand plus 90 in-transit (50 from P39, 40 from P40, both arriving within the next 2 periods). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high profit ($1.0), the service level target should be lean. I expect demand for the next 5 periods (decision window) to average ~100-110 units/week given the Q4 recovery. Requirement for 5 periods \u2248 550 units. Pipeline (197 + 90) = 287. Shortfall is ~263 units. However, I must be cautious not to over-order as the game ends at Period 47. Orders placed now (P43) arrive in P47, which is the final period. Orders placed after P43 will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, I will place an order now to cover the demand for the final period and ensure I don't stock out during the Q4 peak, while being mindful of the high holding cost.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand spike observed in P42 (129 units) matches late November holiday shopping. Expect demand to shift from ~55 to ~100+ units/week for the remainder of Q4/early Q1.",

{
  "rationale": "Product 189616006 is a 'Heavy jersey long leg' legging, which is highly seasonal. We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), heading into the final 4 periods of the game. Historical data from early Q1 (Jan/Feb) showed demand between 100-150 units. We recently saw a holiday spike in Period 42 (129 units) followed by a drop in Period 43 (46 units). Given the date (mid-December), we expect seasonal demand to remain significant (approx 100 units/week) but risk is high because the game ends in Period 47. Inventory on hand is 201 units. In-transit arrivals: P44: 50 units (Ordered P40), P45: 0 (Ordered P41), P46: 0 (Ordered P42), P47: 150 (Ordered P43). Because lead time is 4 periods, any order placed today (P44) would arrive in Period 48 (after the game ends). Therefore, the total available inventory for the remaining periods (P44, P45, P46, P47) is the sum of current on-hand (201) and all future arrivals within the timeline (50 + 0 + 0 + 150 = 200). Total stock available to satisfy remaining demand is 401 units. With 4 periods remaining and an average expected demand of ~80-100 units/week, we already have sufficient stock (401 units) to cover demand (max ~400 units). Any further ordering would only incur holding costs ($1.0/unit) without the possibility of sale before the game ends.",
