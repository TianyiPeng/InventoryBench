Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Tiblisi paperwaist tapered' trousers. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 17.0 and a standard deviation of 4.47. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, the OR engine needs to place a 'catch-up' order. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) will be conservative. However, because we have zero initial stock, we must provide parameters that allow for an immediate order to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent patterns, though as this is the start of the game, it matches the full history provided.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's paperbag waist trouser. Initial historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a mean of approximately 17 units per week. In Period 1, demand was 14, but zero units were sold because starting on-hand inventory was 0. A replenishment order of 25 units was placed in Period 1 with a promised lead time of 4 periods, meaning it is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 25 in-transit. Since on-hand is zero and we face certain lost sales until the first order arrives, I will set parameters based on the full historical sample (N=6, including P1 demand) to establish a baseline. mu_hat should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Mean demand is ~16.5; 5 * 16.5 = 82.5. sigma_hat will also use the default calculation for now as there is no evidence of a regime shift yet. Lead time is kept at the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a pair of women's paperwaist tapered trousers from the 'Womens Everyday Collection'. Historical demand samples (before the simulation start) were [17, 14, 24, 12, 18], averaging 17.0 units. In Period 1 and 2, observed demand was 14 and 26 respectively (Avg = 20.0). Current on-hand is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods, and we are only in Period 3; thus, the orders from P1 (25 units) and P2 (24 units) are still in-transit and not due until P5 and P6 respectively. Current total in-transit is 49. Because demand remains relatively consistent with the pre-game baseline (mean ~17.8), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 (all available data) to capture the slight uptick in recent demand while maintaining a stable forecast. L is set to 'default' (4) as we have seen no evidence of lead-time drift yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product 'Tiblisi paperwaist tapered' is a pair of women's trousers. The promised lead time is 4. No orders (placed in P1, P2, P3) have arrived yet, which is consistent with a 4-period lead time; we expect the first delivery (P1's order) specifically in P5's arrival phase. On-hand remains 0, meaning all demand so far has been lost. Historical demand (pre-game and P1-P3) for Feb/early March shows: 17, 14, 24, 12, 18 (pre-game) and 14, 26, 16 (P1-P3). The mean of all 8 data points is approximately 17.6. Since we are entering March, demand for 'Trousers' in the 'Womens Everyday Collection' likely remains stable or slightly increases toward spring. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent fluctuations (mean ~18.4, std ~5.6), while keeping L at the promised lead time of 4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level covering L+1 (5 periods) of demand (approx 92 units), accounting for the current pipeline of 76 units.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/3/11), we are managing a women's paperwaist trouser. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect the first arrival (25 units) to occur during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales because demand (averaging ~16.75 units/week in the game history) cannot be met yet. Historical demand samples (Pre-game: 17, 14, 24, 12, 18; Game: 14, 26, 16, 11) show a mean of approximately 17 units. There is no evidence of a lead time shift yet as the first order is not overdue until the end of Period 5. For parameters: L is set to default (4). mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean. Given the demand is relatively stable, I will use a window (N=9) covering all available samples to provide a robust mean for the OR engine.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's trouser in the 'Everyday Collection'. The promised lead time is 4. Analysis of Period 5 'conclude' confirms that the Period 1 order arrived exactly in 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 13 units, with 61 units currently in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4). Historical demand samples (before the game) were 17, 14, 24, 12, 18 (Mean: 17). Demand during the game periods has been 14, 26, 16, 11, 12 (Mean: 15.8). There is no strong evidence of a significant demand regime shift or seasonality yet. We will use all available game samples (N=5) to set demand parameters. With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (~median demand), which is appropriate for a stable everyday item without extreme margins.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Average demand is stable around 16-17 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a women's paperwaist trouser, and we have confirmed the actual lead time L=4 based on the arrivals of Period 1 and Period 2 orders (both took exactly 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 29, and there are 42 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Historical demand samples show: 17, 14, 24, 12, 18 (pre-game) and 14, 26, 16, 11, 12, 8 (in-game). The mean demand over these 11 samples is 14.5 units. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has been slightly lower (11, 12, 8), averaging 10.3 units. However, given the product type (Spring trousers), demand may fluctuate as we move further into the season. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full breadth of observed demand while acknowledging the lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting L to 'default' uses the promised 4 periods, which aligns with observed reality.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is 'Tiblisi paperwaist tapered' trousers, and we are entering the spring season. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Current on-hand is 32, with 23 units in-transit (orders from P4, P6, P7). Average demand over the 5 pre-game samples plus 7 game periods (12 total samples) is approximately 15.5 units. The most recent demand (P7) saw a spike to 24, but earlier weeks were lower. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend aims for a 50% service level, essentially matching the median demand. I will set L to 4 based on history. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=7 to capture the demand since the game started, which averages 15.5 units per period. For (L+1) = 5 periods, this leads to an expected demand of ~77.5. Sigma_hat will use all available samples to capture the inherent volatility of the 'Everyday Collection'.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a women's paperwaist trouser. Reviewing the history: Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, and P4). Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged 16.75 units, slightly higher than the initial pre-game samples (avg 17). Recent demand (P7-P8) showing 24 and 23 units suggests a slight upward trend as we enter Spring, but it's not yet a sustained regime shift. Currently, on-hand (19) plus in-transit (38) equals 57 units. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using all available data (all samples including pre-game) provides the most stable baseline for mu_hat. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed in the 'conclude' messages. I'll use 'default' for mu_hat (all samples) to balance the early stability with the recent uptick.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are experiencing a stockout (on-hand: 0). Recent demand has significantly increased: the last three periods (P7-P9) show demand of 24, 23, and 32 (averaging 26.3), compared to the previous average of ~16-17. This shift likely corresponds to the 'Womens Everyday Collection' paper bag waist trousers being a popular spring seasonal item. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). There was no order in P5, which explains the zero arrival in P9 conclude. Our current pipeline (In-transit: 65) consists of orders from P6 (5), P7 (8), P8 (25), and P9 (27). The P6 order is expected to arrive during P10. To address the higher demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the recent spike. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand period. L remains at the calculated/default value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 7: average demand increased from ~17 to ~26 (+50%) following spring seasonality for women's trousers.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/04/22), the SKU is experiencing a significant demand spike associated with spring seasonality for women's trousers. Demand has escalated from an average of ~17 units per period earlier in the season to a recent average of 37 units over the last 4 periods (P7-P10: 24, 23, 32, 56). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6 orders arriving exactly 4 periods later). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 95 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Because demand is increasing rapidly, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this upward shift while avoiding being overly skewed by the single P10 spike of 56. L is set to 4 based on consistent delivery history. This setup helps the OR backend target a base stock level sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~185 units), considering the pipeline already contains 95.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike intensified: Average demand for P7-P10 increased further to 33.75 units/period (last 4 periods). Stockouts occurred in P9 and P10 due to demand exceeding available on-hand inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of women's tapered trousers, currently experiencing a massive demand spike (P10: 56, P11: 95) as we enter late April (late spring/early summer). We have personal inventory stockouts for three consecutive periods (P9-P11). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The demand regime has shifted dramatically from an average of ~17 units to a recent average (P7-P11) of 46 units, with the most recent sample at 95 units. Given the seasonality of 'trousers in woven fabric', we expect this high demand to persist. mu_hat should reflect this new level to ensure the OR backend's base stock (L+1 units of demand) covers the expected sales over the next 5 periods. I am choosing N=5 for the recent regime to capture the climb from 23 to 95. sigma_hat also needs to be updated to reflect this high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand surge confirmed: P11 demand reached 95 units (up from 23 in P8). 5-period average (P7-P11) is now 46 units/period. Sustained stockouts since Period 9 due to underestimating the seasonal paperwaist trouser peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664319001' (Tiblisi paperwaist tapered trousers) is in the midst of a massive seasonal demand surge typical for spring women's fashion. Demand has escalated from 32 (P9) to 56 (P10), 95 (P11), and now 151 (P12). The system has been in a persistent stockout state since Period 9 because earlier orders were based on the obsolete average of ~17 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, but in a high-surge environment, underestimating leads to significant lost sales. To catch up with the exponential growth and cover the 5-period risk window (L+1=5), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Estimating a forward-looking average of at least 120 units/period (given P11=95 and P12=151), the total mu_hat for the 5-period window is 600. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=6, covering the transition from stable to surge) to capture the high volatility seen during this shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth is near-exponential: P9=32, P10=56, P11=95, P12=151. Average demand in the current high-growth regime (P10-P12) is 100 units/period, compared to 17 units/period in P1-P6.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664319001' (Womens Everyday Collection Trousers) is experiencing a massive seasonal demand surge. Period 13 demand was 111, following a peak of 151 in Period 12. Although slightly down from the peak, the volume remains significantly higher than the early-season average of 17. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have been in a stockout state for several periods due to the order pipeline lagging behind this rapid growth. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The goal is to set parameters to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P10-P13) is (56+95+151+111)/4 = 103.25. Setting mu_hat using the explicit forecast for 5 periods: 103.25 * 5 = 516.25. Given the high volatility observed during this surge (demand ranging from 56 to 151 in just 4 weeks), I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for this variation, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level to capture the remaining seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-volume seasonal regime: Period 10-13 average is 103 units/period. Though P13 (111) is lower than P12 (151), demand is still ~6x initial levels.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664319001' (Womens Paperwaist Trousers) is in a massive seasonal demand surge. Period 14 demand reached 171 units, continuing a strong upward trend from 111 in Period 13. The average demand of the last 3 periods is 144.3, significantly higher than the initial regime. Despite orders arriving regularly (lead time stable at 4 periods), the SKU has been stocked out since Period 9 because demand continues to exceed the supply determined by previous forecasts. Since lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover demand for Period 15 plus the 4-period lead-time (total 5 periods). An average demand of ~145 units/period suggests a mu_hat of ~725. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this most recent surge level. Sigma_hat is also increased to reflect high volatility during the growth phase. Note: pipeline inventory is 482 units, and we are currently at 0 on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime surge intensified: Period 12-14 average demand is 144.3 units/period, compared to 103 in Period 10-13. The seasonal peak for this item is currently ongoing and stronger than in previous weeks.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tiblisi paperwaist trousers is in a significant high-volume seasonal regime. Period 15 demand was 122 units, which is lower than the peak of 171 in P14 but remains high. Over the last 4 periods (P12-P15), the average demand is 138.75 units per period. The item has been consistently stocking out since Period 9 because arrivals are fulfilling orders placed before the current surge. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. To stabilize inventory, mu_hat must reflect the current high-demand regime (L+1 = 5 periods). Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the 138.75 average, which translates to a total base stock requirement of ~694 units over the lead time plus review period. With 617 units currently in-transit and 0 on-hand, the goal is to bridge the remaining gap and maintain a high service level for this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in high-volume seasonal plateau: P12-P15 average demand is 138.75 units/period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (Women's Paperwaist Trousers) is in a high-demand seasonal regime. Demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has been: 151, 111, 171, 122, and 147. The average demand over this 5-period plateau is 140.4 units/period. Despite receiving 83 units in Period 16, on-hand inventory remains at 0 due to the significant demand (147 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival messages. To ensure the OR backend captures the current high-volume state, I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the low-demand periods (P1-P11) which would lead to severe under-ordering. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level is 50%. However, given the extreme stockout risk and pipeline status, using recent_N ensures the base stock calculation reflects the ~140 unit/period reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed for P12-P16: Average demand is 140.4 units/period, showing a sustained high-volume seasonal regime compared to the early season.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volume demand plateau for the summer season (Women's Trousers). Analysis of the last 6 periods (P12-P17) shows demand values of 151, 111, 171, 122, 147, and 171, yielding an average of 145.5 units/period. The current period (P18) follows a period of successful fulfillment where the large order from P13 (204 units) finally arrived, ending the long stockout streak, though inventory remains low (33 units). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since the demand is fluctuating around a high mean without a clear upward or downward trend in the last several periods, I am choosing N=6 for mu_hat to capture this seasonal plateau. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=6 to reflect the volatility of this high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend can set an appropriate safety stock for the (L+1) period risk horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for P12-P17 confirmed: average demand is 145.5 units/period, representing the peak seasonal regime for women's woven trousers.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June). The SKU (Womens Everyday Trousers) is in its peak seasonal regime. Demand for the last 7 periods (P12-P18) has averaged approximately 138.57 units/period. The most recent demand was 97 units, which is a dip from previous highs (171, 147), but demand remains high compared to early periods. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 71 and 550 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed in P15-P18 to catch up with the surge), we need to maintain a high base stock to avoid further stockouts while being mindful of the capping mechanism. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime since P12, ensuring the backend estimates demand based on this plateau rather than the whole history.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for P12-P18 confirmed: average demand is ~139 units/period, representing the peak seasonal regime for women's woven trousers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (Women's woven paperwaist trousers) is currently in its peak seasonal demand phase (late June). Recent demand history shows a high-volume plateau: Period 19 demand was 211, while the average demand from Period 12 to 19 is approximately 148 units per period. The on-hand inventory (55) and the incoming arrival from Period 16 (83 units, expected during Period 20 resolution) are insufficient to cover the current demand levels, which have recently spiked back above 200. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand volatility during this seasonal peak (ranging from 97 to 211 in the last 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the high-volume regime (Periods 12-19) which averages ~148 units. This reflects the (1+L) requirement for 5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the same N=8 window to account for the increased variance seen during this seasonal surge, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer to prevent further stockouts while managing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for P12-P19 confirmed: average demand is ~148 units/period, with a recent spike to 211 in P19 indicating continued peak seasonality for women's woven trousers.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are navigating the peak summer season for women's woven trousers. Demand remains high and volatile, with a recent 9-period plateau (P12-P20) averaging approximately 154 units per period (sum of demands: 151+111+171+122+147+171+97+211+175 = 1385; 1385/9 \u2248 153.8). The most recent period (P20) saw demand of 175, following a spike of 211 in P19, indicating that demand has not yet stepped down from its seasonal peak. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline of 559 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P16 order arrived in P20). To maintain service levels during this high-volume regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to cover the observed peak plateau (P12-P20). This targets a baseline of ~154 units/period across the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=9) to capture the significant volatility observed during this peak period (SD \u2248 36). This approach ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (decision period + 4-period lead time) while accounting for the current stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for P12-P20 confirmed: average demand is ~154 units/period, maintaining peak seasonal volume for women's woven trousers.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (women's woven trousers) is in its peak seasonal demand phase (July). Current history shows a sustained high-volume demand regime since Period 12. In the most recent periods (P12-P21), demand has averaged approximately 152.8 units per period, with significant volatility (highs of 211, lows of 97). The inventory position is currently zero on-hand due to this high demand outstripping supply. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the demand has effectively plateaued at this high level rather than continuing its exponential growth, I will use a recent window (N=10, covering P12-P21) to capture the current seasonal regime mean and variance for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This helps the OR backend project the required base stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for P12-P21 confirmed: average demand is ~153 units/period, representing the peak sustained seasonal volume for women's woven trousers in mid-summer.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. This product (womens woven paperwaist trousers) is in its peak seasonal regime. In Period 22, demand was 100 units, but the broader peak regime (since Period 12) has sustained an average of approximately 150 units/period. The last few periods show high volatility (P19: 211, P20: 175, P21: 172, P22: 100), typical of high-summer fashion demand. A lead time of 4 periods remains consistently confirmed by the 'conclude' messages. To capture the current plateau and account for high weekly variance, I will use a 10-period lookback (N=10) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This covers the most relevant high-volume data (P13-P22) to ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent the stockouts seen in P20-P21, while the cap helps mitigate over-ordering as we approach the potential end of the summer season.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (Tbilisi paperwaist tapered trousers) is in its peak summer season. Demand from Period 12 to Period 23 has averaged approximately 148 units per period, fluctuating with high-volume spikes (e.g., 211 in P19) and lower weeks (e.g., 100 in P22). Actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current demand in P22-P23 (avg 111) is slightly lower than the plateau average, but we must maintain capacity for the high variance of this product (z-score will be 0 because profit=1 and holding=1, so q=0.5). To ensure we don't stock out during the (L+1)=5 week lead time window while avoiding excessive holding costs as summer progresses, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=12 (covering the high-demand regime P12-P23). This yields a stable base stock estimate based on the sustained seasonal plateau (~148 * 5 = 740). On-hand is 37 and in-transit is 580 (Total 617), so the backend will order approximately 123 units to reach the target.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for P12-P23 confirmed: average demand is ~148 units/period, maintaining the high-volume seasonal plateau for women's woven trousers through mid-July. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (Tbilisi paperwaist tapered trousers) is in a high-volume seasonal plateau. For Period 25 (late July), demand for the last 13 periods (P12-P24) has stabilized around an average of 145 units/period. The most recent demand (P24) was 178, confirming that the seasonal peak is sustained through mid-summer. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 552 units and expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 725 units (5 * 145), the OR backend needs to order more to maintain service levels. I will set mu_hat based on the last 13 periods (N=13) to capture this sustained plateau regime, and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the high volatility (ranging from 97 to 211) observed during this peak period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (Period 26). This SKU (tapered paperwaist trousers) has been in a high-demand seasonal plateau since Period 12. Most recent demand (Period 25: 132 units) and the average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25: ~141 units) suggest that while demand remains high, it has stabilized from the peak of 211 seen in Period 19. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 131, and in-transit is 479 (representing orders from periods 22-25: 101, 75, 113, and 190). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current stabilized plateau of ~141 units/period while maintaining a high safety stock via explicit sigma_hat to account for historical volatility (std dev remains significant). This ensures the base stock (approx 5 periods of demand) is adequately covered given the high holding cost which equals profit, meaning the OR backend should target a 50% service level naturally.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664319001' (Womens Paperwaist Trousers) is transitioning from its peak summer season (Periods 12-21, avg ~150) into late summer/early autumn. Recent demand in Periods 24-26 (178, 132, 90) shows a distinct downward trend as the peak seasonal volume subsides. Period 26 demand (90) is the lowest since early April. To prevent overstocking during this cooling phase while maintaining availability for the remaining late-summer demand, I am shifting from the long-term plateau average to a more responsive 'recent_N' approach. I will use N=5 to capture the recent deceleration (average demand for P22-P26 is ~124 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to adjust the base stock level reflecting the current lower-velocity demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase detected: Mean demand decreased from ~150 (P12-P21) to 124 (P22-P26), with Period 26 showing a significant drop to 90 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (women's woven paperwaist trousers) has entered a clear descending demand phase as the summer season ends. Following a peak regime (Period 12-21) where demand averaged ~153 units, we have seen a sustained decline over the last 6 periods (P22-P27: 100, 122, 178, 132, 90, 81), with the last two periods dropping below 100 units. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P24-P27) is 120.25 units, while the most recent 2 periods average 85.5. Given the product's seasonal nature, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this 'cooling' trend to avoid excessive terminal inventory. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the downward trend since Period 22. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P23 order arrived P27).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Average demand dropped from peak ~150 to ~120 (P22-P27), with the most recent two weeks (P26-P27) averaging 85.5 units, signaling the end of the summer seasonal peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-133.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend confirms a cooling phase as we move out of the peak summer season for women's woven trousers. Demand has dropped from a peak average of ~150 to a recent 3-period average of 76.3 (P26-P28). Period 28 demand was 58, the lowest since mid-April. This downward trend is expected to continue as late August (Date: 2019/8/26) typically marks the transition away from summer styles. I am adjusting the demand forecast using a recent_N approach (N=7, covering P22-P28) to capture the cooling regime while maintaining enough safety stock to avoid stockouts if demand stabilizes. The Lead Time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 191 units and a significant in-transit pipeline of 337 units, the focus shifts to preventing excessive holding costs as demand continues to decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase intensified: 3-period average (P26-P28) dropped to 76.3 units/period, down from peak summer levels of ~150. Current period (P28) demand of 58 confirms a sustained post-peak seasonal decline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 664319001 (women's woven paperwaist trousers) is clearly in a seasonal cooling phase as we enter September. Demand has dropped from a summer plateau of ~150 units to a 4-period average (P26-P29) of 69.25 units, with the most recent sample at 54 units. Consequently, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect this new regime using recent_N=4. On-hand inventory is currently high (327 units) following large arrivals from orders placed during the peak, and there are 163 units still in-transit. Given the holding cost and the clear downward demand trend, the focus must shift to clearing inventory rather than aggressive ordering. I am maintaining the lead time at the stable observed value of 4 periods and using recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the current lower-volume, lower-variance segment.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Average demand for P26-P29 dropped to 69.3 units/period, marking a significant decline from the mid-summer peak of ~150. Trend is consistent with late-season woven trousers.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand cooling phase is clearly established as we move into September. Demand has consistently declined over the last five periods: P26 (90), P27 (81), P28 (58), P29 (54), and P30 (40). The average demand for these last 5 periods (N=5) is 64.6 units/period, a significant drop from the summer peak of ~150. Given the 'Womens Everyday Collection' classification and the product being 'Trousers in woven fabric', this decline aligns with the transition from summer styles to autumn/winter inventory. Current on-hand inventory is high at 381 units, which is approximately 6 periods of supply at the current demand rate. In-transit inventory of 69 units further pads this position. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), overstocking is as penalized as understocking. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend and reduce the target base stock, allowing the on-hand surplus to burn off. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand cooling: Average demand for P26-P30 dropped to 64.6 units/period, confirming the end of the summer seasonal peak for woven trousers.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (Women's woven paperwaist trousers) has exited its peak summer seasonal plateau (~150 units/period) and is currently in a sustained cooling phase as we move into September. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 57.2 units/period, with the most recent two periods averaging 46.5. Current on-hand inventory is 336 units, which is significantly high given the reduced demand. With an expected total demand of approximately 230-280 units over the next 5 periods (L+1) and 61 units still in-transit, our total inventory position (337) is already sufficient to cover requirements without further ordering. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower late-season demand regime (avg ~62) while keeping sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods to reflect the reduced volatility in this phase. No new orders should be triggered by the OR backend given the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-season demand cooling: Average demand for Period 27-31 dropped to 57.2 units/period, confirming a transition from the summer peak to a low-volume autumn regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (women's woven trousers) is in a clear late-season cooling phase. Demand has dropped significantly from the summer peak (~150 units/period) to a low-volume autumn regime. Period 32 demand was only 25 units, and the 5-period average (P28-P32) is approximately 46 units/period. The current on-hand inventory of 356 units is extremely high relative to this new demand level, covering nearly 8-14 weeks of sales at current rates. Given that holding costs equal profit ($1.0/unit), the priority is to avoid ordering and allow on-hand stock to deplete. The pipeline is nearly empty with only 16 units in-transit (ordered in P29), which is appropriate. I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent cooling trend (averaging P28-P32), which will result in a base stock level significantly lower than current on-hand inventory, effectively triggering a zero-order response from the backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition to low-volume autumn regime confirmed: Period 28-32 average is 46 units/period, down from peak summer levels of ~150. Significant inventory surplus observed as demand cooled faster than supply adjustments.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tiblisi paperwaist tapered trousers is in a clear late-season decline as we move into October. Demand has fallen from its summer peak of ~150 units/period to a 3-week average of 36.3 units/period (P31-P33). Currently, on-hand inventory is 341 units with zero units in-transit. Given that recent demand is around 31 units and the lead time is 4 periods, the current stock (341) covers approximately 11 periods of demand, which is far in excess of the 5-period requirement (L+1). Holding costs are high ($1.0/unit), equal to the profit margins, making inventory reduction the primary objective to maximize total reward. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the current low-volume autumn regime (approx. 36 units/period). This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than the current inventory, preventing the OR backend from placing any new orders while we liquidating the surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase reached a low-volume autumn regime: average demand for P31-P33 is 36.3 units/period, down from peak summer levels of ~150.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (Women's woven paperwaist trousers) has entered a late-season low-volume regime. Current demand has dropped significantly from the summer peak (approx. 150 units/period) to an average of 42.6 units over the last 5 periods (P30-P34: 40, 53, 25, 31, 27). The current on-hand inventory is 314 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the inventory level of 314, we have enough stock to cover over 7 periods of demand at current rates (~43 units/period). With a holding cost of $1.00/unit/period, managing this surplus is the priority. No new orders should be placed. I will use a conservative recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current autumn demand levels and prevent the OR engine from ordering against the obsolete high-volume summer data.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition to low-volume autumn regime confirmed: Period 30-34 average is 35.2 units/period, showing a sustained decline from summer peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-284.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this seasonal product (trousers) has shifted from a mid-summer peak of ~150 units/period to a low-volume autumn regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 30.2 units/period, with the most recent observation being 15 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 299 units and there is no inventory in transit. With a lead time of 4 periods, we are looking at total coverage for 5 periods (Review + Lead). Even at the recent average of 30 units/period, we have enough inventory to cover ~10 periods (299/30). Ordering now would only increase holding costs, which are equal to the profit margin ($1.0). Therefore, the goal is to set parameters such that the OR backend calculates a base stock level lower than the current inventory, resulting in a zero order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current autumn regime and 'default' for L as the lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition to low-volume autumn regime remains sustained: Period 31-35 average is 30.2 units/period, a significant decline from summer peaks. Inventory remains in surplus.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is entering the late-autumn/winter period (October 21). Historical demand for these women's woven trousers has plummeted from a summer peak of ~150 units/period to a recent 5-period average of 21.8 units (P32-P36). Specifically, the last two periods saw demand of 15 and 11 units. Current on-hand inventory is 288 units with zero in-transit. With a lead time of 4 periods and demand now consistently below 20 units, the current stock covers approximately 13-25 periods of future demand, far exceeding the required (L+1) horizon. Calculating mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) captures the current low-volume regime (~22 units/period, scaled by 1+L=5). I will maintain L=4 (promised and verified). Sigma_hat will also be calculated using the recent 5 samples to reflect the decreased volatility (standard deviation) of the current regime. No new orders are expected or needed given the significant existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed in low-volume autumn trough: P34-P36 average demand dropped to 17.7 units/period, representing an 88% decline from summer peaks.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (women's woven paperwaist trousers) has entered a terminal low-volume autumn/winter regime. Demand has plummeted from summer peaks of ~150 units/period to just 8 units in Period 37. On-hand inventory is 280 units, while the recent 3-period average demand is approximately 11.3 units/period (P35-P37). Given the current holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), and the current inventory covers over 20 weeks of demand at the current rate (far exceeding the 5-week lead-time + review cycle), no new orders are necessary. Parameters are adjusted using a recent_N (N=4) approach to reflect the low-volume trough, which will keep the base stock level significantly below the current on-hand inventory, resulting in zero new orders until the surplus is cleared or demand recovers.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed in late-autumn trough: P35-P37 average demand is 11.3 units/period, representing a >90% decline from summer peak levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (women's woven trousers) is in a definitive late-autumn trough, as evidenced by demand drop-off from summer peaks of ~150 to a 3-period average (P36-P38) of 11.3 units. Current on-hand inventory is 265 units with zero in-transit, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (~23 periods of supply). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the ending on-hand inventory (265) significantly exceeds any foreseeable demand for the lead time + review period (5 periods * ~11 units = 55 units), no new orders are required. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs and address the surplus, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the low-volume regime, which will result in a base stock level far below current on-hand, effectively halting procurement.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (women's paperwaist trousers) is now in a deep late-autumn/winter trough. Demand has fallen significantly from the summer peak of ~150 units/period to an average of 10.3 units over the last 3 periods (P37-P39: 8, 15, 8). With Period 40 starting on 2019-11-11, we are well past the seasonal relevance for this woven fabric item. Currently, on-hand inventory is 257 units, which at the current demand rate (~10/week) provides over 25 weeks of cover. The goal is to minimize holding costs while the game approaches its conclusion (Period 47). No new orders are needed, and I will set parameters to reflect the low-volume regime (N=5) to ensure the base stock calculation remains below the current inventory level, preventing any automated ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed in seasonal trough: P37-P39 average demand is 10.3 units/period, down from peak summer levels of ~150. Significant inventory surplus of 257 units exists against very low late-season demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (Women's woven paperwaist trousers) is currently in a deep seasonal trough as of mid-November (Period 41). Demand has stabilized at very low levels, averaging 12.3 units over the last 3 periods (P38-P40). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 243 units, which is enough to cover approximately 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. There are no outstanding orders in-transit. Given that the game ends at Period 47, and the holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit per unit ($1.0), the priority is to avoid any further ordering and liquidate existing stock. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock target remains well below current on-hand levels to produce a zero order.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (Women's woven trousers) is in its late-season demand trough as we approach late November (Period 42). Demand is extremely low, with the most recent period (P41) recording only 3 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 9.6 units per period. We currently have 240 units on hand and 0 units in transit. Given that the current on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 25 weeks of demand at current rates, and the game ends in Period 47, we should continue to place zero orders. To ensure the OR backend's capped policy results in a zero order, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-volume regime (recent_N=5) and using the default lead time (4 periods). The high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0) further necessitates inventory reduction.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed in late-season trough reaching single digits: P39-P41 average demand is 8.3 units/period, down >94% from summer peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Trousers) is in a late-season trough as of December 2nd. Current demand is low (P39-P42 average of 15.2 units, though P42 saw a small spike to 36). On-hand inventory is 204 units, which is significantly higher than any foreseeable demand for the remaining 5 periods of the game (total expected demand < 100 units). With a profit of $1/unit and a holding cost of $1/unit/period, any additional ordering will result in negative reward due to excessive holding costs. The strategy is to continue liquidation and avoid all ordering. Parameters are set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend base stock remains far below current on-hand inventory levels.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a late-season phase. We see 'Tiblisi paperwaist tapered' trousers, which experienced a massive summer peak (up to ~200 units/period) and a subsequent decline into autumn. Recently, there has been a minor demand uptick in Periods 42 and 43 (36 and 47 units respectively), possibly due to holiday promotions or end-of-season clearing, but this follows a long trough of single-digit/low-teen demand. With 157 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we have sufficient inventory to cover over 3 periods of even this elevated demand (47 * 3.3 = 155), and significantly more if demand reverts to the trough mean of ~10. Given the lead time of 4 periods and the game ending at Period 47, any order placed now would only arrive in Period 48, which is beyond the game's horizon. Additionally, maintaining high inventory at this stage incurs unnecessary holding costs ($1.0/unit). Therefore, the goal is to set parameters that result in zero new orders while allowing the existing stock to satisfy remaining demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent slight increase in demand (averaging ~22 units/period) to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation doesn't inadvertently trigger an order, though the current inventory surplus makes ordering unlikely regardless.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand uptick: Period 42-43 showed a slight increase in demand (avg 41.5 units) compared to the deep trough in P37-41 (avg ~10 units), likely due to December holiday seasonality or clearance.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final weeks of the season (Period 45 of 47). Current on-hand inventory is 145 units. Recent demand has fluctuated: P42 (36), P43 (47), and P44 (12). The December uptick (avg ~31 over the last 3 periods) is significantly higher than the November trough (avg ~8), but total remaining demand for the final 3 periods (P45, P46, P47) is unlikely to exceed the current on-hand stock of 145. Even at the higher December average, demand would be approx 93 units. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 49, which is past the end of the simulation. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. I will set the parameters to reflect the current December demand level while ensuring the OR backend's inventory logic does not trigger an order by utilizing the existing on-hand surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), approaching the end of the simulation. Period 45 showed a significant demand spike to 125 units, which follows a moderately high Period 43 (47 units). This suggests a strong holiday/December peak for women's trousers. The on-hand inventory has dropped sharply from 145 to 20 units. There are 14 units in-transit (ordered in Period 45) arriving in Period 49. Given we are at Period 46 of 47, any order placed now (Period 46) would arrive at Period 50 (after the game ends), as lead time L=4. However, we must provide parameters for the OR backend. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand holiday regime (averaging 61.3 units over P43-P45) while ensuring sigma_hat reflects the high volatility of this spike. Although the arrival will be post-game, setting mu_hat based on the current regime (approx 60 units/period) is the most accurate reflection of the current state provided by the simulation logic.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed in late December: Period 45 demand reached 125 units, up from single digits in November. 3-period average (P43-P45) is 61.3 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand holiday window (late December). Period 45 demand was 125 units and Period 46 reached 92 units, causing a stockout as on-hand inventory was exhausted. The current on-hand is 0, with 171 units in-transit (orders from P45 and P46). Given lead time is 4 periods, these units won't arrive until Periods 49 and 50. For the current Period 47 decision, we must set parameters to satisfy demand through Period 51 (L+1). Although we are in a peak, demand typically drops sharply after the first week of January for 'Everyday Collection' trousers. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the holiday surge (average ~86 units/period), but rely on the OR backend's cap and the existing pipeline to prevent excessive over-ordering as the festive spike subsides. Sigma is set to recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility seen in the last few weeks (ranging from 12 to 125).
