Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for SKU 689389004 shows an upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 60, 56, 82, 71, and 107. The most recent sample (107) is significantly higher than the initial samples, suggesting a potential seasonal increase as we move into February (approaching spring fashion cycles for 'soft viscose weave' shirts). On-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. The promised lead time (L) is 4. To ensure we cover demand during the review and lead time period (1+L = 5 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the average of all available samples (avg \u2248 75.2) multiplied by (1+L). For mu_hat, 75.2 * 5 = 376. For sigma_hat, the historical standard deviation is approximately 20; for 5 periods, this scales to roughly sqrt(5)*20 \u2248 45. Using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 captures the recent trend while maintaining statistical grounding.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a soft viscose weave shirt. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) show: 60, 56, 82, 71, 107. There is a clear upward trend culminating in 107 units in the most recent sample (Feb 4th) and 86 units in Period 1 (Feb 11th). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 109 units in transit from Period 1. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the Period 1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5. Given the rising demand trend (average of last 5 samples is ~75, but the last 3 average ~88), I will use recent_N to capture this shift. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, the base stock needs to cover 1+4=5 periods of demand. Projected demand (mu_hat) will be based on the recent 3 samples (82, 71, 107) plus the P1 realization (86), averaging 86.5. mu_hat = 5 * 86.5 = 432.5. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a soft viscose shirt, which typically sees balanced demand but is currently showing a significant upward trend. Historic demand (samples) was between 56 and 107. However, Period 1 demand was 86 and Period 2 demand spiked to 151. This suggests a demand regime shift or early seasonal pickup, with the mean of the last two periods being 118.5. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and awaiting arrivals. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (109 units) and P2 (112 units) are in-transit (Total 221). Following the timing logic, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 (visible P6). To capture the recent demand surge, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5, covering the last 3 samples + P1 & P2 demand data points) to provide a more responsive base stock calculation while waiting for inventory to arrive.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a soft viscose shirt, which often sees increased interest during transitions into Spring. Looking at recent demand samples: Jan (60, 56, 82, 71) averaged ~67, but Feb (107, 86, 151, 78) averaged ~105. This indicates a significant upward shift in the demand regime. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 haven't arrived yet (which is expected as L=4 means P1 arrives in P5). My priority is to set parameters that assume this higher Feb demand will continue as we enter March, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 to capture the recent higher demand variance and mean while smoothing out the outlier of 151.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~67 in Jan to ~105 in Feb (+56%). Setting parameters to capture this higher baseline.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Denise Shirt' in the Divided (youth/trendy) collection. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, it should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase (not yet visible in the history). Therefore, 'arrived=0' so far is expected. Historically, demand showed a spike in early February (151 units in P2) but has since cooled down (78 in P3, 62 in P4). The pre-game sample for Feb 4 was 107. Average demand over the last 5 samples (including pre-game) is approximately 97, but the last 4 game periods average 94. Given the inventory is currently 0 and transit is 493 (covering ~5 periods of demand at ~100/unit), we need to maintain a baseline that accounts for the L+1 (5 period) risk. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the February-March trend, which reflects a higher mean than the January samples.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of L=4. Demand analysis: The initial regime shift insight noted an increase to ~105 in February, but the subsequent raw demand samples (P3: 78, P4: 62, P5: 57) suggest a cooling trend back toward the historical average or a stabilization around a lower mean than the Feb peak. The total demand history (including seed data) is: 60, 56, 82, 71, 107 (pre-game) and 86, 151, 78, 62, 57 (in-game). Recent 5-period mean is 86.8. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this stabilization while still acknowledging the high Feb demand. Given L=4, the pipeline inventory (384) plus current on-hand (52) equals 436 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate (87*5=435). No immediate stock-out is expected, but we must maintain coverage for the L+1 window.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 5). Demand trend appearing to stabilize/soften after Feb peak, reverting toward a mean of ~80-90.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand is 83, and in-transit is 272 (total 355). Looking at demand history: Jan started at ~67, Feb peaked at ~115 (avg of 107, 86, 151), and March has showed a stabilization/softening (78, 62, 57, 81), averaging ~70 units per period. The product is a soft viscose shirt, which typically sees steady demand in spring. Given the holding cost vs profit ratio (q = 0.5), we aim for a service level that doesn't overstock. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead time is stable at the promised 4. For demand (mu_hat), recent data suggests the Feb spike was temporary; using recent_N (N=4) captures the softening trend (avg ~70) better than the full history (avg ~88). Sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-February spike has settled into a stable regime of approximately 70 units/period (avg of Periods 3-6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), we observe that the lead time is consistent at 4 periods (Period 3 order arrived in Period 7). The demand history shows a peak in February followed by a more volatile but generally lower trend in March (Period 4: 62, Period 5: 57, Period 6: 81, Period 7: 117). The average demand over the last 5 samples (P3-P7) is 79 units. While Period 7 spiked to 117, looking at the product description 'viscose shirt/blouse' and the spring date (April), we should prepare for moderate spring seasonal demand. On-hand inventory is 118 with 120 (from P4) expected this period. Total pipeline + on-hand is 238, which covers about 3 periods of average demand. To maintain the service level while accounting for recent volatility (117 in P7 vs 57 in P5), I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation to balance the higher recent spike with the lower March baseline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. Historical demand data shows a spike in mid-February (Period 2: 151) and late March into early April (Period 7: 117, Period 8: 141). The shirt (DENISE SHIRT S.0) is a standard garment, likely seeing variable spring demand. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Regarding inventory, we have 97 on-hand and 118 in-transit (ordered P8). To cover demand for the next (L+1) = 5 periods, we observe the mean demand of the last 4 periods (Periods 5-8) is roughly 99 units. However, demand is trending upward recently. I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent spring demand regime, using N=4 as it captures the recent volatility and the recent drift better than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: Spring season demand increasing, with the last two periods (P7-P8) averaging 129 units, compared to previous 4-period average of 79. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Demand for the 'Denise Shirt' has been volatile: after a spike in Period 8 (141 units), Period 9 demand dropped to 72 units. The 2-period average (P8-P9) is 106.5, while the 5-period average (P5-P9) is 93.6. Given the spring season and historical variation, I am prioritizing the recent regime while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 279 units (from orders in P8 and P9), and on-hand is 25. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the spring baseline (approx 93.6 * 5 = 468) and sigma_hat with recent_N=5 to account for the recent variance between 72 and 141 units. This ensures we cover the L+1 (5 period) horizon without over-ordering during a dip.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '689389004' is a viscose shirt, which historically shows volatility as it enters the spring/summer season (April). In Period 10, the on-hand inventory hit 0, resulting in lost sales because the orders placed in Periods 5, 6, and 7 were 0 (due to high pipeline inventory at the time). Based on the 4-period lead time confirmed in history (e.g., Period 4 order arrived in Period 8), the order placed in Period 8 (118 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 11 and be visible in the next step. However, the last two periods (P9-P10) showed a softening of demand (avg ~67 units) compared to the spike in P7-P8 (avg ~129 units). Given the high cost of stockouts (lost profit and demand coverage) versus the holding cost ($1.0 each), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent volatility and the return to moderate demand levels, ensuring the base stock formula (L+1) covers the upcoming 5-week window.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in April: After a spike to ~130 units in late March/early April (P7-P8), demand has reverted to a more stable range of 60-70 units in the most recent two periods (P9-P10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a soft viscose blouse, which is highly relevant for the transition into spring/summer weather. Looking at the history, an order of 109 units (placed P1) arrived in P5, and 112 (placed P2) arrived in P6, confirming a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Since my last order with a confirmed arrival was from P4, I am currently waiting on orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11. In P11, I had 0 on-hand inventory and lost 90 units of demand because the P8 order (118 units) should have arrived during P12 resolve, not P11. Recent demand (P9-P11) averages ~75 units, but history shows early April spikes. With L=4, I must cover 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (avg ~95) and sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in March/April, ensuring the OR backend targets a sufficient base stock to recover from the current stockout as soon as shipments arrive.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6, 2019. Historical demand shows multiple regimes: a February spike (avg ~100+), a March lull (~70), an early April spike (avg ~130), and a recent late April stabilization (avg ~71 over the last 4 periods). On-hand is 57, with 372 units in-transit. The order from Period 8 arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 (arrived P12). However, we are currently missing arrivals for orders placed in P9, P10, and P11, which should have arrived in P13 (today) or upcoming periods. Since arrivals happen after the decision phase, the P12 conclude message only confirms the P8 arrival. The high in-transit (372) relative to current demand (~70-90) suggests we are well-covered for the (L+1) horizon, as 372 units / 5 periods = 74 units/period. I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand forecasting to capture the post-April-spike stabilization and 'default' for lead time since the 4-period timing is holding steady.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late April/early May: Avg demand Periods 9-12 is 71.25 units. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/05/13), we are entering the mid-May period. Reviewing the demand history, there was a significant spike in late March/early April (P7-P8 reaching ~130 units), which subsided to a more stable range of 60-90 units throughout April. However, Period 13 saw a sharp drop to 35 units, the lowest recorded. While this might be a single-period anomaly, visual inspection of the last 5 periods (P9-P13: 72, 62, 90, 61, 35) shows a declining trend with an average of 64 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the recent arrival (P9 order arrived in P13). On-hand inventory is currently high at 183 units, and with 211 units in-transit (orders from P10 and P11), our pipeline is well-saturated. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current cooling trend while maintaining enough stock to handle the moderate volatility (sigma_hat) observed in this spring season. This helps prevent excessive holding costs given that Profit = Holding Cost ($1.0).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation from Period 14 (read at Period 15 START) shows a significant demand slowdown in May (P13: 35 units, P14: 31 units), compared to the late April average of ~70 units. This suggests the spring peak has passed or the shirt category is entering a lower-demand regime for late May. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P8, P9, and P10 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is high (303 units) due to the arrival of larger orders from P9/P10 coupled with this demand drop. To avoid excessive holding costs (which equal profit per unit), I am reducing the demand forecast parameters to reflect the recent 3-period slowdown (P12-14 average ~42). I will use recent_N=3 to quickly react to this downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for mean reversion.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Demand dropped significantly in May, averaging 33 units over the last two periods, down from the previous April/early May average of ~70.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. We are seeing a significant demand drop in May for SKU 689389004 (Denise Shirt). Demand in the last three periods (P13-P15) was 35, 31, and 25 units respectively, averaging 30.3 units per period. This is a sharp decline from the April average of ~71 units. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 338 units, and there are no units in-transit. With an average demand of ~30 units and a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods, which totals approximately 150-160 units. Since on-hand (338) is already double this requirement, and holding costs equal profits ($1.0), it is critical to avoid further ordering. I am setting L to calculate (which confirms the stable 4-period lead time observed in history) and adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low-demand regime. The backend's capped policy should result in a zero order given the high inventory relative to the new demand parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in May: Mean demand dropped from ~71 units (Apr) to ~30 units (May), likely due to post-spring seasonality for this long-sleeved shirt product.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, and the product is a long-sleeved shirt. Demand has significantly declined as the season transitions into summer, dropping from ~70 units/period in April to an average of ~26 units/period over the last four periods (P13-P16: 35, 31, 25, 17). This persistent downward trend aligns with the seasonal nature of the 'Garment Upper body | Shirt' category with long sleeves. We have a substantial on-hand inventory of 321 units and zero orders in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At the current usage rate of ~25 units/period, our 321 units provide over 12 periods of cover, which is far beyond the required safety level. To avoid further accumulation of holding costs (which currently equal the profit margin), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the decreased volatility at these lower volume levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Entering summer season, demand has dropped to an average of 26 units/period (P13-P16), a ~63% decrease from the April baseline. High inventory levels (321 units) now pose a significant holding cost risk.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved viscose shirt, which is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as we enter June (summer). Demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) has dropped to an average of 27 units (35, 31, 25, 17, 27), compared to April levels of ~70-130. On-hand inventory is currently 294 units with 0 in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the critical priority is reducing the inventory glut. The current on-hand stock (294) covers over 10 periods of current demand, well exceeding the (L+1=5) target. My goal is to prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders. To achieve this, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method (N=5) to reflect the low-demand summer regime, and keep L at the promised 4 periods. The OR engine's base-stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) will be far below the 294 units on hand, ensuring an order of 0 and allowing the inventory to bleed down.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved shirt, which is experiencing very low demand due to summer seasonality. Demand over the last 4 periods (P15-P18) has been extremely low: 25, 17, 27, and 11, averaging 20 units. Inventory on-hand is 283 units, which is enough to cover over 14 weeks of current demand levels. At a holding cost equal to the profit ($1.00 each), this inventory level is extremely risky and inefficient. We need to prevent any new orders until this inventory is liquidated. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods to reflect this low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend's calculated base stock remains far below current inventory levels, resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Avg demand (P15-P18) is 20 units/period, down from Spring avg of ~70. Overstock status reached due to seasonal drop.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are in a sustained summer demand trough for this long-sleeved shirt SKU. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 19.8 units, significantly lower than the spring baseline of ~70. The current on-hand inventory is 264 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate and a holding cost equal to the profit margin ($1.00). This inventory alone covers approximately 13 periods of demand at the current rate (264 / 20 = 13.2), which is far beyond the (L+1) = 5 period protection window required. No further orders should be placed until this surplus is cleared. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this lower, stable summer demand regime, and maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This configuration will ensure the OR backend's base_stock calculation remains well below current inventory levels, resulting in zero new orders to minimize further holding costs.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the summer season (July 1st), and the product is a 'Straight-cut shirt... with long sleeves'. Demand has consistently dropped and stabilized at a low level due to seasonality. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P15-P20) is approximately 19.3 units. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 247 units with no units in transit. Given the current demand rate, this inventory covers approximately 12-13 periods of demand, which is far beyond the (L+1=5) target. Consequently, there is no need to place orders, and the priority is to minimize holding costs by letting the inventory deplete. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the low summer demand regime (~19 units) and use default for L as it has been consistent.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019, which is mid-summer. The product (689389004) is a long-sleeved viscose shirt, which is seasonally less relevant during warm months. Demand has been consistently low since mid-May, averaging 23.3 units/period over the last seven periods (P15-P21). On-hand inventory is currently 201 units with no units in transit. Given the current average demand, this inventory covers approximately 8.6 periods, which is significantly more than the (Lead Time + 1) requirement of 5 periods. With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the service level requirement is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). The primary objective is to liquidate the excess stock to minimize holding costs while avoiding new orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect this sustained low-demand summer regime. Since on-hand inventory (201) exceeds the likely base stock calculation (approx. 23.3 * 5 = 116.5), the OR backend will correctly place zero orders.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (Denise Shirt, a long-sleeved shirt) is currently in its summer demand trough. Historical demand through June (Periods 17-20) was very low, averaging ~18 units/period. However, the last two periods (P21, P22: July 1 and July 8) show a significant uptick to 46 and 60 units respectively. This likely represents early 'Back-to-School' or late-summer transition shopping, as consumer interest in long-sleeved items starts to recover from the mid-summer low. Despite this uptick, the on-hand inventory remains very high at 141 units, which is significantly higher than the current (1+L) demand needs (estimated at ~5 * 40 = 200 theoretically, but considering the carry-over risk and 1:1 profit/holding cost ratio, we should be cautious). Since profit equals holding cost, the OR backend targets a 50% service level. My current on-hand inventory (141) easily covers the expected demand for the next 5 periods given the recent mean. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the recent upward trend (averaging ~35 units/period) while allowing the existing overstock to deplete naturally to avoid further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand began recovering from summer lows in early July: Period 21-22 average is 53 units/period, compared to June average of 18 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is a long-sleeved shirt, which saw a significant demand drop during June (summer lows ~18 units/period) but is now showing signs of recovery as we move through July (P21-P23 avg = 46.3 units). The most recent period demand was 33, but the 3-period trend (46, 60, 33) suggests a new baseline around 45-50 units. Transitioning into August, we expect this recovery to continue or stabilize as consumers begin looking toward late-summer/early-fall items. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 108 units with 37 in-transit (total pipeline 145). To capture the current recovery while remaining cautious of high holding costs (which equal profit), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to focus on the July recovery trend (avg ~46.3, mu_hat = (1+4)*46.3 = 231.5). This allows the OR engine to maintain a base stock that covers the anticipated demand increase without over-ordering into potential inventory bloat.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed in July: Mean demand increased from ~18 (June) to ~46 (July P21-P23). This marks the end of the summer low regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for this long-sleeved shirt product has shown a recovery from summer lows (which averaged ~18 units in June) to a current July average of approximately 41.5 units (P21-P24: 46, 60, 33, 27). While P23 and P24 were lower than P21-P22, they still represent an increase over the June baseline. The 'carry_over_insight' from Period 24 identifies a mean of ~46 for July so far. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this post-recovery baseline (P21-P24 average = 41.5). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple historical arrivals. Pipeline inventory is currently 106 units (orders from P23 and P24), and on-hand is 81. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 187 units, which covers approximately 4.5 weeks of the current demand mean. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 allows the OR backend to quickly adapt to this newest regime while accounting for the recent variance in July demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 26. Historical data indicates a demand recovery in July (Periods 21-25) following a summer low in June. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is 39.4 units, which is significantly higher than the June average of ~18, but reflects a slight cooling from the initial July spike. The product description (long-sleeved viscose shirt) suggests that as we move into August and head toward autumn, demand may begin to trend upwards again due to seasonality. Current on-hand inventory is 50, with 127 units in-transit (ordered in P23, P24, and P25). With a stable lead time of 4 periods, we expect the P23 order to arrive in P27 (next period). To maintain availability while managing holding costs (since profit equals holding cost, the target service level q is 0.5), I will use the last 5 periods to estimate demand (N=5) and stick with the calculate method for lead time as it has been consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: July/August transition: Demand has established a new mean of ~40 units/period (avg Periods 21-25), up from the June low of 18, moving into the pre-autumn season.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are observing the transition from summer into the pre-autumn season for a long-sleeved shirt SKU. Demand has recovered from June lows (~18) and stabilized around ~40 units/period (average P21-P26 is 39.7 units). On-hand inventory is low (9 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 147 units (ordered P23-P26). Given the lead time is 4 periods, the order from P23 (37 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of the current period (P27), which will bring on-hand up to 46 before demand is satisfied. The holding cost and profit are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR backend targets a 50% service level which is very sensitive to overstocking. Since demand is currently stable around 40 units, I will use a recent_N of 6 (P21-P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the July/August recovery without including the summer slump or old spring spikes. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand was 59, exceeding the starting on-hand inventory of 46 (which included the 37-unit arrival from Period 23). This results in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The product is a long-sleeved viscose shirt, which typically sees demand increases as the transition from summer (August) to autumn (September) begins. Recent demand (P26-P27) has averaged 50 units, significantly higher than the early August/July baseline of ~40. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P23 order arrived P27). I will now project a higher demand mean to account for the autumn seasonal ramp-up. Given profit = holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, but with high demand volatility and seasonal growth, setting parameters based on the most recent 5 periods (mean ~38, but trending upwards) with a slight explicit bias to ensure the pipeline is filled for September.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal ramp-up confirmed: Demand in late August (P27) hit 59 units, showing a clear upward trend from the 30-40 unit range seen in July/early August. Total pipeline (153) and current stock (0) suggest aggressive replenishment is needed for the September peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late August, transitioning into the September autumn season. Historically, this SKU (long-sleeved viscose shirt) saw a massive demand spike in February/March (mu ~100+), followed by a spring regime (mu ~70), and a summer low (mu ~20). We are now observing the beginning of the autumn ramp-up: demand has increased from a July mean of ~40 to 59 in P27 and 79 in P28. Given the product type and the timing, I anticipate demand will continue to rise as we enter September. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant stockouts occurring in the last two periods (sold < demand), we must increase the mu_hat to capture the expected autumn peak. I will use an N=3 for demand to weight the recent ramp-up (P26-P28 avg = 59.6) and an explicit L=4. Since the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L)*mean, recent_N=3 will set a base stock level that targets approximately 60 * 5 = 300 units in the pipeline/on-hand, which is appropriate for the emerging trend.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up confirmed: Demand in late August (P27-P28) averaged 69 units, exhibiting a significant upward trend from the summer/July mean of ~40. Stockouts occurring as demand exceeds previous safety stock levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (viscose long-sleeved shirt) is entering the high-demand autumn season (September). We observe a clear upward demand trend: demand in Period 28 was 79 and Period 29 was 51, with an average of 65 over the last two periods, compared to the July/August average of ~40. Current inventory is 0 with 192 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by recent arrivals (Periods 27, 28, and 29 all arrived with L=4). To prevent further stockouts during the September peak, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (covering the start of the ramp-up) and sigma_hat with recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with seasonal transitions. The backend will target a service level of 50% (since profit=holding cost), but the base-stock calculation will account for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), which is appropriate given the current upward trajectory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (long-sleeved shirt) is currently in an autumn growth regime. Over the last five periods (P27-P31), demand has averaged 61.2 units (59, 79, 51, 66, 51), significantly higher than the summer average of ~18-20 units. We have experienced stockouts in the last five consecutive periods because the on-hand inventory (which was depleted during the transition) and arriving orders (which were placed during the lower-demand July phase) have been insufficient to meet this ramped-up September demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 259 units in-transit, we need to maintain a robust base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent autumn demand level (~306 units for mu_hat) while the OR backend's cap helps prevent excessive over-ordering as we await the delivery of larger orders placed in P29 and P30.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Avg demand for Periods 27-31 is 61.2 units, a ~200% increase from the summer low. Stockouts are frequent due to lagging pipeline arrivals from the previous low-demand regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the viscose shirt has stabilized in an 'Autumn' regime. Over the last 6 periods (P27-P32), demand has averaged 61.6 units (59, 79, 51, 66, 51, 64). Although recent demand is somewhat lower than the late August peak, it remains consistently high compared to the summer. The lead time is verified to be stable at 4 periods. Since P27, the system has frequently stocked out because the pipeline arrivals (orders from the summer low) were insufficient. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 268 units in-transit. To ensure we meet the current demand of ~62 units/period over the (L+1) period window (5 periods total), we need a total inventory position of roughly 310 units. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current Autumn regime mean and volatility, which will allow the OR backend to maintain the required service level as the larger orders from Periods 29-30 (91 and 94 units) begin to arrive.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is a long-sleeved shirt entering the peak Autumn/Winter season. Demand has been steadily rising from a summer low of ~20 units to a current mean of approximately 64 units over the last 7 periods (P27-P33: 59, 79, 51, 66, 51, 64, 87). The most recent demand (P33) hit 87 units, signaling a potential further upward shift as we enter October. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 units on-hand and 218 in-transit (orders from P30-P33), we need to maintain a robust base stock to avoid the stockouts seen in August/September. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current autumn baseline (approx 64 * 5 = 320), and sigma_hat will also use N=7 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Avg demand for Periods 27-33 is 65.3 units, continuing the upward trend from summer lows. Anticipating further increases as colder weather approaches in October/November.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in early October, entering the peak autumn/winter season for a long-sleeved shirt product ('soft viscose weave'). Historical demand for the autumn ramp-up (Periods 27-34) shows an average demand of 62.6 units. The most recent period (P34) saw a drop to 44 units, which may be a temporary fluctuation, but the overall trend since August remains strong (mean ~60-70). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 54 units on hand and 212 in transit (mostly ordered during the P29-P32 high-demand phase), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the stabilized autumn regime (P27-P34) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring we account for the current seasonal baseline and volatility without being overly reactive to the single-period dip in P34.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October. Demand for this viscose long-sleeve shirt had a clear autumn ramp-up from late August through September, peaking around Period 33 (87 units) but has since cooled down to 44 and 31 units in the last two weeks. This suggests the initial autumn surge has peaked or is entering a mid-season lull before potential winter interest. Demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) averaged 55.4 units, but the most recent 2 periods averaged only 37.5. Given the high pipeline of 224 units (which includes large orders from P32-P34) and relatively high stock on hand (59), I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to balance the seasonal peak with the recent cooling. This ensures we don't over-order while waiting for the substantial pipeline to arrive. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak occurred around Period 33 (87 units) and has since softened in October, averaging 37.5 units in P34-P35.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-54.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 21st. History shows an autumn demand peak for this long-sleeved 'DENISE SHIRT' occurred in late September (Period 33: 87 units), followed by a clear softening as we move deeper into October (P34-P36 demand: 44, 31, 26). The moving average for the last three periods has dropped to approximately 33.7 units. With 80 units on-hand and 177 units in-transit (total pipeline of 257), and demand clearly trending downward towards winter, there is a high risk of overstocking if we continue the previous aggressive replenishment strategy. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this downward trend and avoid excessive holding costs, as the profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), making the target service level 50%.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak for 689389004 concluded at Period 33; demand has since shifted to a downward regime in October, averaging ~34 units (P34-P36) compared to the September average of ~61.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (long-sleeved viscose shirt) has transitioned from an autumn peak (approx. 65 units/period in September) to a softer October/November regime. Demand for the last four periods (P34-P37) has averaged 33.25 units (44, 31, 26, 32). On-hand inventory is currently 89 units with a pipeline of 136 units (ordered P34 and P35). Since total inventory position (225) far exceeds the required coverage for the (L+1) window in this lower demand regime (approx 5 periods * 33 units = 165), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent average of the last 4 periods (N=4) to prevent over-ordering and minimize further holding costs as we move toward the winter season, where demand for this specific blouse may remain low or continue to drift.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the late autumn/pre-winter season for this straight-cut blouse. Historical demand shows a clear peak in September (mean ~61) followed by a significant softening in October. Demand for the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has averaged 31.2 units (44, 31, 26, 32, 23). The most recent period (P38) shows demand falling further to 23 units. On-hand inventory is currently 154 units, and with 48 units in-transit (P35 order) expected to arrive in Period 39 conclude, the total pipeline is 202 units. Given the current demand mean of ~30, this inventory covers over 6 periods of demand (L+1 = 5 periods). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should target the mean demand. Increasing inventory further would incur unnecessary holding costs during a declining seasonal phase. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to reflect the current softened demand regime (N=5) and keep lead time at calculated to match the consistent 4-period observations.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Winter transition: Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~31 units/period since Period 34 (Oct), down from the Sept peak of ~61 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is currently in a late autumn/winter demand regime. Since Period 34 (late September/early October), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower mean compared to the September peak. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P34-P39) is approximately 28.3 units, with the most recent period (P39) showing a further drop to 14 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 188 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers over 6 periods of supply. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $1.0 (service level target ~50%), and the fact that we have zero in-transit shipments (all orders up to P35 have arrived), the primary goal is to avoid further accumulation of stock. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this lower demand baseline (~28 * 5 = 140) and sigma_hat with recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility. With on-hand at 188 and base stock calculated around 140-150, the OR backend will correctly halt ordering (final order = 0) to bleed off excess inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is currently in a Late Autumn/Winter seasonal decline. Since Period 34 (late Sept/Oct), demand has shifted from a September mean of ~61 units to a significantly lower mean of ~30. In the most recent four periods (P37-P40), demand has dropped even further, averaging just 19.5 units (32, 23, 14, 9). With on-hand inventory at 179 units and zero in-transit, we are significantly overstocked relative to the current sales rate. At a mean of ~20 units/period, the current stock provides roughly 9 periods of coverage (well beyond the L+1 = 5 period target). To avoid escalating holding costs which equal our profit per unit, I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat at levels reflecting this lower demand regime (using recent_N=7 to capture the shift since P34) while relying on the OR backend's inventory balancing to prevent unnecessary replenishment orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand decay confirmed: Demand has dropped below the Oct/Nov average of ~30, with the last two periods (P39-P40) averaging 11.5 units. Significant overstock exists (179 units vs ~20 units demand).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is a long-sleeved shirt entering the late November/December winter season. Demand has significantly decayed from the autumn peak (approx. 65 units/period in September) to a very low winter level, averaging 11.7 units over the last three periods (P39-P41). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, we have 167 units on-hand with zero in-transit, which is more than 14 times the current weekly demand. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, and any additional ordering would only exacerbate holding costs. I am setting L to the promised 4 periods and using a recent 4-period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand winter regime, which will ensure no new orders are placed while we liquidate existing stock.

On-hand inventory is 154 units with zero in-transit, which is sufficient to cover approximately 12.8 periods of current demand levels. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit/period) relative to the margin ($1.0/unit), and the clear downward seasonal trend as we approach December, the priority is to liquidate existing stock rather than placing new orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the stabilized winter low and maintaining zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime established: Average demand (P39-P42) is 12 units/period, confirming a significant drop from the October average of ~30. The product is currently in a significant overstock position relative to the end-of-year seasonal forecast.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (a long-sleeved soft viscose shirt) is currently in a winter demand regime, which is significantly lower than its autumn peak. Demand over the last five periods (P39-P43) has averaged 13 units (14, 9, 12, 13, 17), confirming the 'winter demand decay' identified in previous insights. Current on-hand inventory is 137 units with 0 in-transit. With average demand around 13 units and a lead time of 4 periods, current stock covers approximately 10 periods of demand, which is well beyond the L+1 (5 period) safety stock requirement. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand winter regime while maintaining the default lead time of 4, allowing the OR backend to calculate a low base stock that will be easily met by existing inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'DENISE SHIRT S.0' is a long-sleeved shirt entering the mid-December period (Period 45). Historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern: demand peaked in September (avg ~61) and has steadily declined through October (avg ~34) to a very low winter regime in November and December. Over the last 6 periods (P39-P44), demand has averaged 12.5 units/period (ranging from 9 to 17). Currently, on-hand inventory is 127 units with no units in transit. Given the current demand mean of ~12.5 and a lead time of 4 periods, current stock covers approximately 10 periods of demand (127 / 12.5 = 10.16). Since we are at Period 45 of 47, no further orders are required to satisfy demand for the remainder of the game. Ordering now would only increase holding costs without contributing to sales. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand winter regime using recent_N (N=6) to minimize the base stock level calculated by the OR backend, ensuring no new orders are triggered.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (long-sleeved shirt) is in a stable low-demand winter regime. Demand over the last 7 periods (P39-P45) has averaged 12.7 units, consistently remaining between 9 and 17 units. Current on-hand inventory is 113 units, which provides approximately 9 periods of coverage at the current consumption rate. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and no units in transit, the current stock is more than sufficient to cover demand through the end of the year and into the early January period. No new orders are required. The parameters are set using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current winter demand baseline and avoid further overstocking while holding costs are equal to profit per unit.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime stabilized: Avg demand (P39-P45) is 12.7 units/period, down from the October average of ~34 units. Product remains in an overstock position with 113 units on hand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is currently in a confirmed low-demand winter regime. Since Period 39 (early November), demand for this long-sleeved shirt has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 12.7 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 96 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next (L+1) periods (approx. 64 units). Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the optimal service level is 50%, favoring lean inventory to avoid further holding costs. There are no units in-transit, and the lead time is stable at 4 periods. My parameters aim to prevent any new orders until the existing stock is depleted below the safety threshold of the current low-demand regime.
