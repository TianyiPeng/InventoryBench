Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 708021001, a 'Pinky Loose Fitted Tank'. The historical demand samples (115, 48, 41, 6, 64) show an average of approximately 54.8 units per period, but with significant volatility (std dev ~39). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is a sports vest top, demand may begin to pick up as we approach spring/warmer weather in the coming weeks. For the first decision, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available history) to capture the recent mean and variance, which allows the OR backend to set an initial base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). On-hand and in-transit are currently zero, so the backend will initiate an order to meet the calculated base stock.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a sports tank top (Pinky Loose Fitted Tank). Observed demand in Period 1 was 99 units, while historical samples (Jan to early Feb) showed lower values (115, 48, 41, 6, 64). The mean of the 5 historical samples is 54.8, while Period 1 demand (99) suggests a potential upward shift as we enter spring/fitness season or simply high volatility. The promised lead time is 4. No orders have arrived yet (at L=4, P1's order is expected to arrive in Period 5). On-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in P1 (demand 99, sold 0). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat (N=3) to account for the most recent demand levels (6, 64, 99) while transitioning into the active season. L will be left at 'default' (4) until actual lead times are observed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a sports vest top. Historically (January), demand was moderate (avg ~53/week), but there was a significant spike in week 1 of 2019 (115 units). Recently, demand has been 99 and 45. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for the first two periods because the promised lead time (L=4) means no arrivals until Period 5. Total in-transit is 255 (orders from P1 and P2). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and slightly higher average compared to the full historical mean, while keeping L at the default promised value of 4 since no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a sports tank top. Demand has been erratic (99, 45, 11) with a significant drop in the most recent period. Total on-hand is currently 0 with 362 units in transit (ordered in P1, P2, and P3). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at P4, the P1 order (placed at the start of P1) is expected to arrive during P5 (at the start of P6 decision), as L=4 means Arrival = N+L. Currently, we have zero sales because we started with zero on-hand and nothing has arrived yet. In-transit inventory (362) covers the pipeline for now. I will use the mean of the available historical samples (115, 48, 41, 6, 64, 99, 45, 11) to estimate demand. The average demand is approximately 53.6 units. With L=4 (covering 5 periods), mu_hat should be around 268. Since the OR backend uses a capped policy and calculates based on (1+L), I will set L to the promised value of 4 and use recent_N for demand parameters to capture the recent historical samples and the initial three periods of the game.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Ladies H&M Sport' tank top. Historical demand data from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04 shows a mean of 54.8 units. Since game start (Period 1-4), demand has been 99, 45, 11, and 127. The mean of these 4 periods is 70.5. Combining all 9 data points, the global mean is 61.8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 should arrive in Period 1+4=5 (which happens after this decision). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (at least L=4 is expected). Total in-transit is 410 units (sum of orders from P1-P4: 121+134+107+48=410). Because we are entering the spring season (March), sports apparel demand often fluctuates or increases. I will use recent_N with N=9 (all available samples) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L, as there is no evidence yet to suggest the lead time differs from the promise.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a sports tank top. The first batch (121 units) ordered in Period 1 arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since then, the on-hand inventory has dropped to 4 due to demand. Historically, demand has been volatile: [115, 48, 41, 6, 64] (pre-game) and [99, 45, 11, 127, 117] (Period 1-5). The recent two periods (127, 117) show a spike compared to the low demand in Periods 2 and 3. As we are moving into spring (March), sportswear demand is typically increasing. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to balance the recent spike with previous stability, capturing the shift towards higher seasonal demand. Lead time (L) is confirmed at 4.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is a sports tank top. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being met (P1 order arrived in P5, P2 order arrived in P6). Demand is quite volatile (samples: 115, 48, 41, 6, 64 from pre-game, and 99, 45, 11, 127, 117, 60 in-game). The most recent 3 periods (P4-P6) show an average demand of 101.3 units, compared to the earlier periods which were lower. This suggests a potential uptick as we move towards spring/warmer weather for sportswear. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 376, which covers nearly 4 periods of recent average demand. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent higher activity while smoothing slightly, and 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period promise is holding. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to account for the current high variance.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a sports vest top, which typically sees rising demand in spring and summer. Historical demand samples (avg ~55) and recent in-game demand (avg ~72) suggest a slight upward trend, though variance is high. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory is healthy (356 units in transit), and on-hand is 139. Given the promised lead time of 4, our base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture the recent higher activity levels (N=7 for demand to include all in-game data, N=7 for sigma) and 'calculate' for lead time to use the confirmed history.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a sports vest top, which typically sees rising demand as spring progresses and people engage more in fitness activities. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (Orders from P1-P4 arrived in P5-P8). Current on-hand is 73, and in-transit is 332 (from orders in P5, P6, P7, and P8). Demand has been volatile: 99, 45, 11, 127, 117, 60, 46, 114. The average demand across these 8 periods is approximately 77.38 units. Given the transition into April and the product type (fast-drying sports vest), I expect demand to remain robust or slightly increase due to seasonality. mu_hat should cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N=5 captures the behavior since the first stock arrival in P5, where demand has averaged 76.6 units per week. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent performance while keeping lead time at default since it is stable.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a sports tank top, and with spring/early summer approaching, demand is expected to remain firm or increase. Historical demand shows significant volatility (ranging from 11 to 127). The last 5 periods (P5-P9) show a mean demand of 88 units and a standard deviation of approximately 31. Promised lead time is 4, and consistently observed lead time is also 4. In-transit inventory is high (427), which includes orders from P6 (162), P7 (87), P8 (24), and P9 (154). The order from P6 is expected to arrive this period (P10). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent, relevant demand regime since the inventory stock-out ended.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-stockout (P5-P9) with mean ~88; Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the product 'PINKY Loose Fitted Tank' is entering the late spring/early summer season, where sports apparel demand typically remains steady or increases. Recent demand from P5-P10 averages 81 units per period, with a standard deviation around 31. This is a stabilization following initial high volatility. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P6 order arrived P10), matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy with 145 on-hand and 370 in-transit (orders from P7-P10). I will use recent_N=6 to capture this stable regime for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock calculation accurately reflects the current post-stockout performance. This approach balances the high service level required for the $19 profit margin against the $1 holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a sports vest top, which typically sees steady demand in spring. In Period 11, demand was 47, continuing a lower-demand trend observed from Period 10 (demand=46), compared to the higher volatility in Periods 8 (demand=114) and 9 (demand=103). Historically, the lead time has been rock solid at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5 through P11). On-hand inventory is healthy at 185 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 298 units. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=4 to capture the recent stabilization between 46 and 114 (Mean ~77), ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the earlier stockout recovery spikes. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to reflect recent variance. Lead time 'L' will remain at default as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/05/06), we are observing a seasonal decline in demand for the 'PINKY Loose Fitted Tank' as we move further into spring. The demand for the last three concluded periods (P10-P12) was 46, 47, and 21, showing a clear drop from the earlier regime (Period 5-9 mean ~88). The current period demand (Period 12 conclude) of 21 is the lowest since February. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 188 with 312 in transit (total 500 units). Given the softening demand, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward trend (mean ~38) to prevent overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level for the expected (L+1) period demand window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: avg decreased from ~88 to ~38 units (-56%) as seasonal interest appears to be cooling.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 is May 13, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant decline in the last three periods: P11 (47), P12 (21), and P13 (29). This confirms the 'cooling' regime identified in Period 13 carry-over, dropping from a mean of ~88 to a mean of ~32 units over the last three periods. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (P5-P13 conclusions). Currently, we have 313 units on-hand and 158 units in-transit (ordered in P10, P11, P12). Given the promised lead time L=4, the base stock target should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current demand rate (~32/period), we need approximately 160 units total inventory. Our pipeline (313 + 158 = 471) is significantly overstocked relative to current demand. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current low-demand regime. This will result in an order of 0, allowing on-hand inventory to deplete and minimizing holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the current volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand for this 'PINKY Loose Fitted Tank' shows a significant decline starting around Period 12 (late April). The demand for the last three periods (P12-P14) has been 21, 29, and 26 units, confirming the 'cooling' regime identified in Period 13 insights. Mean demand over these last three periods is approximately 25.3. On-hand inventory is very high at 392 units, with an additional 53 units in-transit (from P11 and P12 orders). Given that (1+L) periods of demand at the current rate (5 * 25.3 = 126.5) is far below current inventory, the goal is to stop ordering and let the excess stock bleed out to minimize holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late May (2019/5/27). The product is a loose-fitting sports tank top, which typically sees peak demand in spring/early summer. While a demand regime shift was noted at Period 12 (dropping to ~38), Period 15 saw a sudden spike to 103 units. Comparing this to the historical data (Jan/Feb mean ~55, March/April mean ~88), the demand is volatile. However, lead time remains extremely stable at 4 periods. Inventory management is currently in an overstock position (304 on-hand + 38 in-transit = 342 total, vs. an average demand of ~40-60). To prevent further excessive holding costs while protecting against another 100+ unit spike, I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to catch the late-season fluctuations (periods 12-15 mean = (21+29+26+103)/4 = 44.75). The L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 4. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the high variance between P14 and P15.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late May (Period 15 spike to 103 units following a low-mean regime), suggesting potential end-of-season clearance behavior or inconsistent local demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status check: Period 17 (June 3rd). On-hand inventory is 226 units with 26 units in transit. Demand significantly spiked in the last two periods (P15: 103, P16: 116), contrasting the low-demand regime observed from P12-P14 (avg ~25). This likely represents a summer seasonal peak for a sports vest top. To respond to this shift while mitigating the risk of over-ordering on 'clearance' behavior (as suggested in Period 16 insights), I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to balance the low (P14) and high (P15, P16) observations, resulting in a mean of approximately 67.75 units per period. For lead time, I'll use the 'calculate' method as history has shown a stable 4-period lead time. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the increased volatility without over-reacting to the sudden step-change in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Average demand jumped from ~25 to ~110 units (+340%), coinciding with the start of June (Summer season).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime for this sports vest top, which began around Period 15 (late May). Demand over the last three periods (P15-P17) has averaged approximately 105 units (103, 116, 96), a significant increase from the previous cooling period. The 'In-transit' balance of 171 units accounts for orders placed in Period 16 (26 units) and Period 17 (145 units), matching the promised lead time of 4 periods (P16 order due P20, P17 order due P21). I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this sustained summer demand spike (105 units/period * 5 periods = 525). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the current volatility within this high-demand window. Lead time remains 'default' (4 periods) as arrivals have been consistent.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19 (mid-June). Historical demand for this 'Loose-fitting sports vest top' showed a significant regime shift starting in Period 15 (late May), with demand jumping from a low-regime average of ~25 units to a high-regime average of ~91.5 units (Periods 15-18: 103, 116, 96, 51). Although Period 18 saw a dip to 51, the overall June/Summer trend remains stronger than the previous spring lull. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals until Period 16), though no orders have arrived in Periods 17 or 18 because no orders were placed in Periods 13 or 14. We now have 293 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 16, 17, and 18) and 79 on-hand. To maintain the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current summer regime (~91.5 * (1+4) = 457.5) and keep L at the default promised 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 24th, 2019 (Period 20). The product is a PINKY Loose Fitted Tank (Sportswear), which is in peak demand during the summer season. Based on history, demand significantly increased starting at Period 15 (avg \u2248 86.6 units/period). Periods 17, 18, and 19 show consecutive zero arrivals, but these orders (placed at P13, P14, P15) were actually for 0, 0, and 0 units respectively, explaining the silence. The first non-zero order in this regime (placed P16) is due to arrive next period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current demand regime (P15-P19) is much higher than the previous trough, I will use N=5 to capture this summer sports season peak. With high profit ($19) vs. low holding cost ($1), the priority is maintaining stock during the peak summer months.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand confirmed (P15-P19): Average demand shifted to ~87 units/period, up from the P12-P14 low of ~25 units. This coincides with the seasonal relevance of the sports vest top.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st. The product is a 'Loose-fitting sports vest top', which is in peak summer seasonality. Demand analysis: Since the regime shift in Period 15 (June), the demand has been high and volatile, with samples: 103, 116, 96, 51, 67, 101. The average demand for this summer regime (P15-P20) is approximately 89 units per period. Inventory status: We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand) after Period 20, having only sold 38 units against a demand of 101. Pipeline: There are 494 units in transit. Shipments from Period 17 (145 units), Period 18 (122 units), and Period 19 (138 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 21, 22, and 23 respectively. Lead time: Observations consistently show a 4-period lead time (P16 order arrived in P20). To maximize profit while managing the current stockout and protecting against volatility during the peak season, I will use a recent N=6 (the summer regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the L=4 lead time.

The SKU 708021001 (sports vest top) is currently in its summer peak demand period.

The last 7 periods (P15-P21) show a mean demand of approximately 79 units (103, 116, 96, 51, 67, 101, 59). Despite a stockout in P20, the demand signal remains robust for July. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P21 arrival confirms P17 order arrived on time). We have 86 units on-hand and 391 in-transit (orders from P18, P19, P20, P21). To maintain inventory through the summer peak while accounting for the recent variability (sigma), I will use the last 7 periods to define the current regime. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the summer demand levels rather than the spring lull or the initial launch volatility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-summer season (July 15) for a 'Loose-fitting sports vest top', a product highly relevant to the current weather. Recent demand analysis (Period 15-22) shows a clear shift to a higher mean. Following a temporary dip around Period 21, demand increased again to 81 units in Period 22. The summer regime (P15-P22) averages approximately 84 units per period. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. With 127 units on-hand and 309 units in-transit (covering orders from P19, P20, P21, and P22), the pipeline is reasonably full, but we must maintain the base stock level to match the summer demand through the 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this summer regime accurately while allowing for the observed volatility (sigma_hat) in these warmer months.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a sports vest top (708021001), currently in the peak summer demand phase (July). Recent history (P15-P23) shows a stabilized high-demand regime following the late spring dip. Excluding the stockout in P20, the average demand over the last 8 periods (P15-P23) is approximately 89 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. Pipeline inventory consists of orders from P20 (89), P21 (42), P22 (40), and P23 (72), totaling 243 units. With on-hand inventory at 166 units, the total inventory position is 409 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current summer rate (~445 units needed). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to capture the summer volatility seen in late May and June.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is the end of the peak summer retail season for this 'Ladies H&M Sport' vest top. Over the last 10 periods (P15-P24), demand has averaged 82.9 units per period. While recent demand dropped to 47 in P24, the overall summer regime (P15-P24) shows significant volatility (std dev ~26) and remains higher than the spring baseline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 208 units on hand and 249 in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked. As we approach August, demand is expected to begin a seasonal decline. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the summer average while sigma_hat will also look at the last 10 periods to account for the high volatility observed in June/July. This ensures enough safety stock for any late-summer surges while naturally tapering orders as the season ends.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), the 708021001 sports vest top is entering the late summer phase. While the summer peak (P15-P23) saw average demand of ~87 units, the last two weeks (P24-P25) have seen a drop to 47 and 48 units respectively. This suggests the peak demand period is tapering off as we transition out of mid-summer. Additionally, there were missing shipments for orders placed in Periods 13, 14, and 15 (which should have arrived by P17, P18, and P19); however, since those order quantities were zero, there was no physical inventory lost, but it confirms the system skips 'conclude' messages for zero-quantity orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent drop in demand, I am using a recent_N (N=5) window to capture the start of the post-summer decline. This N=5 window averages 64.4 units/period, which is more responsive than the full history mean but more conservative than the 2-week drop to 47-48 units, ensuring we don't under-stock if demand fluctuates before a final seasonal exit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: Summer peak (avg ~87) transitioning to late-summer decline (avg ~48 units, -45%) as of early August.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a sports vest top (708021001), currently entering mid-August. Demand has transitioned from the summer peak (~87 units/period) to a lower regime. The last three periods (P24-P26) show demand values of 47, 48, and 34, averaging ~43 units/period. This confirms the seasonal decline noted in the Carry-over Insights (Period 26). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 208 and in-transit at 210, the total pipeline is 418 units. Expected total demand over the L+1 (5 period) horizon is approximately 215 units (5 * 43). Given the current total stock far exceeds this need and the holding cost is $1.0 vs $19 profit, the focus is on allowing existing inventory to deplete to avoid excess holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the lower 43-unit average and sigma_hat with recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility, ensuring the OR backend stops ordering more units while we are heavily overstocked.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 708021001 (Loose Fitted Tank) is entering late August (Period 28), which historically marks the localized end of the summer peak for sports vest tops. Demand from Period 24 to 27 has averaged approximately 48 units (47, 48, 34, 63), confirming the decline from the June/July peak (~87 units). Current on-hand inventory (217) plus in-transit stock (138) equals 355 units. With an expected demand of ~48 units per period and a lead time of 4, the total pipeline requirement for 5 periods (L+1) is approximately 240 units. Since 355 > 240, there is already significant excess inventory relative to the current sales velocity. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent post-summer regression. L is set to default (4) as arrivals have been consistently on time.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late August (Period 29), entering the end of the summer season for this sports vest top. Demand in the last 5 periods (P24-P28) has averaged 52.4 units, confirming a decline from the summer peak average of ~87 units. Current inventory status is high (242 on-hand) with 43 units arriving in 1 period (ordered P25). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock level relative to the current cooled demand and the seasonal nature of the product, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the late-summer cooling. Sigma_hat is also set to recent variability. This will likely result in a zero or near-zero order to burn off excess inventory before the season ends.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand for this sports vest top has transitioned from its summer peak (~87 units) to a late-summer/early-autumn decline. Over the last 6 periods (P24-P29), the average demand is 49.3 units. The most recent demand (P29) was 34 units. As we enter September, demand is expected to remain in this lower regime or continue to taper off. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 251) relative to this demand level, leading to high holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend's base stock calculation accounts for the reduced sales rate, helping to avoid further overstocking while maintaining a buffer for late-season variability.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal decline for this 'Loose Fitted Tank' (vest top) as the summer ends. Demand since Period 24 (late July) has averaged approximately 47 units (samples: 47, 48, 34, 63, 70, 34, 21), which is a significant drop from the summer peak of ~87. The last two periods (P29-P30) show even lower demand (34 and 21), suggesting a further cooling of interest as we enter September. On-hand inventory is currently high at 230 units, which covers nearly 5-7 weeks of the current demand regime. With an additional 51 units in transit (expected to arrive in P33 and P34), we are significantly overstocked relative to the current sales pace. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs during this off-season phase, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand trend (N=7 covers the period since the late-summer decline began) and using a calculated lead time. The high on-hand inventory will likely prevent any further ordering from the OR backend this period as the pipeline exceeds the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: Post-summer demand has further declined to an average of ~28 units (P29-P30) following the late-August average of ~48 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product is a sports vest top, which is entering its off-season in the Northern Hemisphere. Historical data shows a clear downward demand trend: the summer peak (P15-P24) averaged ~87 units, which dropped to ~48 in late August, and has further stabilized at ~32 units over the last three periods (P29-P31: 34, 21, 41). With 189 units on-hand and 60 units in-transit (total pipeline of 249), and a current demand mean of ~32, we have nearly 8 weeks of coverage. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My objective is to prevent further inventory accumulation as demand cools. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established lower-demand regime (avg ~32, significantly lower than the long-term mean), ensuring the OR backend targets a lower base stock and avoids unnecessary ordering while holding cost is considered against the $19 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: Post-summer demand has stabilized at a low level (P29-P31 avg ~32 units), confirming the transition to the autumn off-season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is a sports vest top, which is highly seasonal. We are currently in the autumn off-season. Demand for the last 4 periods has averaged ~37.5 units (21, 41, 54, and last recorded demand was 54), showing a slight uptick but remaining significantly lower than the summer peak of ~87. We have 135 units on-hand and 60 in-transit (from orders in P29, P30, P31). Total inventory (195) is more than sufficient to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand at the current rate (~37.5 * 5 = 187.5). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low autumn demand, I am using a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-summer regime while preventing over-ordering during the seasonal decline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The product is a sports vest top, which has transitioned from its summer peak into an autumn off-season. Recent demand (P29-P33) has averaged 43.8 units per period, but this average is skewed by a recent spike to 69 units in P33. Prior to P33, the post-summer average was significantly lower (~32 units). Given the cooling weather in late September, I expect demand to remain low. However, the last two weeks (54 and 69 units) show higher volatility than the prior three weeks (21-41 units). I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent post-summer behavior (including the latest spike) while maintaining a conservative stance against over-ordering for a fading season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P29 order arrived in P33). Existing on-hand (96) and in-transit (74) inventory totaling 170 units is sufficient for approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late September (P32-P33) with demand rising to 69 units, though the overall seasonal trend for the vest top remains downward for the autumn period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019/10/07), we are in the autumn off-season for this sport vest top. Recent demand (P29-P34) has averaged 43.3 units, but with noticeable volatility (range 21-69). The most recent demand was 41. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. We have 76 units on-hand and 128 in-transit (orders from P31, P33, P34), totaling 204 units of pipeline inventory. Given the seasonal decline, I will set mu_hat using a recent window (N=6) to capture the post-summer average (~43 units/period), which results in a base stock target covering 5 periods of demand ((1+L=5) * 43 = 215). This ensures we maintain a conservative but safe buffer against the recent volatility (e.g., the P33 spike to 69) without over-ordering into the late autumn. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect this higher late-season variance.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (October 14, 2019), the demand for the sports vest top is in its autumn off-season. Recent demand observations (P34-P35) show levels of 41 and 25 units, significantly lower than the summer peak but showing some variability (P33 was 69). The average demand over the last 7 periods (P29-P35) is approximately 41 units. Inventory levels are currently 60 on-hand with 190 in-transit (orders from P33, P34, and P35). We must ensure we don't over-order as the season ends. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-summer stabilization while accounting for the recent late-September volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product is a sports vest top, which is now in its off-season (autumn). Demand has decreased from a summer peak of ~87 to a recent average of ~38 units (P32-P36). Specifically, the last two periods (P35-P36) showed demand of 25 and 16, continuing the downward seasonal trend. Current on-hand inventory is 44, with a significant pipeline of 205 units. Lead times have been stable at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline relative to low autumn demand, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the stabilized lower demand regime while avoiding over-ordering during the seasonal decline. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) will provide a balanced forecast based on the most recent 5 weeks (P32-P36 demand: 54, 69, 41, 25, 16; avg 41), which helps the OR engine prevent excessive stock accumulation for this seasonal item.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Late-autumn demand has further cooled, with the P35-P36 average dropping to ~20 units from the P32-P34 average of ~55 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28, transitioning into the late-autumn/winter off-season for a sports vest top. Recent demand (P35-P37) has averaged 16 units, confirming the regime shift noted in Period 37. On-hand inventory is 81 units, with 196 units in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high in-transit volume (including orders of 75 and 71 units from P34/P35) relative to the low current demand, there is a risk of significant overstocking as we move further into the off-season. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (~16 units/period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This configuration will likely result in the OR backend placing zero or very small orders because the pipeline (196) and on-hand (81) far exceed the required base stock for a 5-period window (estimated ~80-100 units).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 708021001 (sports vest top) is now in its clear autumn/winter off-season. Current date is Nov 4, and demand has consistently dropped following the summer peak and late-September volatility. The last two periods (P37-P38) showed very low demand (7 and 8 units, respectively), confirming the regime shift identified in Period 37. On-hand inventory is high at 148 units, which, combined with 121 units in-transit (part of which is the P35 order of 71 units due to arrive shortly), is more than sufficient to cover the current low-demand regime for several periods. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock levels (269 total pipeline) relative to the current mean demand (~15-20 units), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent low-demand trend (P35-P38) and prevent excessive ordering while the off-season continues.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37: Early-November demand (P37-P38) dropped significantly to an average of ~8 units/period, confirming a deep off-season for the vest top category.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 11, 2019, which is late autumn/early winter. The product (Loose-fitting sports vest top) has entered its deep off-season. Recent demand from Period 37 to 39 has plummeted to 7, 8, and 10 units respectively, averaging ~8.3 units per period. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 39 about a deep off-season regime. On-hand inventory is currently very high (209 units) relative to this demand, covering over 20 weeks of sales at the current rate. With an additional 50 units in-transit (remaining from Period 37), there is no need to order more. To prevent the OR backend from ordering against such high inventory, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture only the current low-demand regime (~8 units/period), and keep L at default (4). High existing inventory will naturally lead to zero orders.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is a loose-fitted tank top (Ladies H&M Sport), which is a highly seasonal summer item. Demand history shows a clear decline: P35-P36 averaged ~20 units, and P37-P40 has averaged only ~8 units/period, confirming a deep off-season regime. On-hand inventory is currently 217 units with 35 units in-transit (ordered P37, expected arrival P41). Total available stock (252) far exceeds any foreseeable demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) given the current mean of 8. In fact, current stock covers over 30 weeks of demand at the current rate. Therefore, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to reflect this low-demand state using the most recent 4 periods (N=4), while L remains at the calculated average of 4. No further orders are needed, and the backend logic will naturally suppress ordering since pipeline inventory is well above the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a deep off-season level (P37-P40) with an average of ~8 units/period, down from the late-autumn average of ~20 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). The product is a sports vest top, which is now in its deep off-season. Demand has consistently stabilized at a very low level since Period 37, with the most recent sample (Period 41) dropping to just 3 units. On-hand inventory is at 249 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining 5 periods of the game (ending at Period 47), even at the previously observed deep off-season average of ~8 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set a low mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period average (P37-P41) to ensure no further orders are placed, as the current stock safely exceeds any realistic forecast for the rest of the year. This avoids further holding costs and potential overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a deep off-season level (P37-P41) with an average of ~7 units/period, following the late-autumn decline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43), well into the deep winter off-season for this loose-fitting sports vest top. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average demand over the last 6 periods (P37-P42) being approximately 8.2 units per period (7, 8, 10, 7, 3, 14). On-hand inventory is currently 235 units with zero units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, my primary objective is to minimize holding costs while maintaining a minimal service level for this residual demand. The current stock of 235 units is sufficient to cover over 28 periods of demand at the current rate (235 / 8.2), far exceeding the required (L+1) window. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect this stable off-season regime, and default for sigma_hat. No further orders are required, and the OR backend's inventory-on-hand subtraction will correctly result in an order of 0.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Loose-fitting sports vest top', which is currently in its deep off-season (December). Demand has remained consistently low since late October (Period 37). While Period 43 saw a minor uptick to 33 units, the 7-period average (P37-P43) remains approximately 11.7 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 202 units with zero in-transit, which is more than sufficient to cover multiple months of demand at these levels (Base Stock for L=4 would be approximately (4+1)*12 = 60 units). Given the high holding cost relative to the low current demand and the excessive surplus on hand, no new orders are necessary. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (N=7) to ensure no additional stock is triggered by the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $938.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). The SKU is a sports vest top, which typically sees low winter demand, but we are observing a recent pre-holiday demand spike (P43: 33 units, P44: 57 units). This likely represents a short-term gift-buying or fitness-resolution-related uptick rather than a full regime shift back to summer levels. On-hand inventory is 145 units with no units in transit. Given the game ends at Period 47 and the lead time is consistently 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) will arrive in Period 49 (45+4), which is after the game concludes. Therefore, we should not place any new orders as they will only contribute to ending inventory costs without the possibility of being sold. I will set parameters to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) results in a zero or negative value to prevent ordering. mu_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture the low off-season average (approx 17 units/period) while accounting for the recent uptick, but the current on-hand (145) is already sufficient to cover the remaining 3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Mid-December demand uptick observed (P43-P44) with demand rising to 57 units, potentially holiday-related, despite being the deep off-season.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 708021001 (sports vest top) is currently in a late-December holiday peak despite being the seasonal off-season. Demand has surged over the last three periods (P43-P45: 33, 57, 78 units), likely due to holiday shopping or January fitness resolutions. The current average demand (N=3) is 56.0 units/period, a massive shift from the deep off-season average of ~7. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this holiday momentum. On-hand inventory is 67, and there are 10 units in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level, but the rapid demand shift requires mu_hat to be responsive to avoid stockouts during the final peak week of the year.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Year-end demand spike confirmed: Demand increased for three consecutive weeks (P43-P45) from ~7 to an average of 56 units, likely driven by holiday gifting and New Year fitness Preparation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1273.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30). In the last period (P46), we experienced a stockout as demand hit 107 units, confirming a massive year-end demand spike likely driven by holiday sales and New Year fitness resolutions. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P43-P46) has jumped to ~69 units, compared to the deep off-season average of ~8 units. With actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods, we must set parameters that cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 0, and pipeline inventory is 104 units (ordered in P45 and P46). To recover from the stockout and maintain service levels for early January, which often sees high demand for fitness apparel like this vest top, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to compute a target base stock that reflects the current seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: P47: Demand spike sustained for 4 periods (P43-P46) with average ~69 units vs previous ~8 units (+760%), confirming a strong Year-End/New Year fitness seasonal trend.
