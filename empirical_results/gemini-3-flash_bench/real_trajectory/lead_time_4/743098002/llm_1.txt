My order today (P1) will arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 6's start. d) Pipeline Assessment: Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (L+1 periods) to avoid stockouts, as no inventory exists. e) Order Logic: Expected demand per period is ~38 units. To cover 5 periods (P1-P5), I need 38 * 5 = 190 units. I will order 210 units to provide a small safety buffer for potential lead-time variance or demand spikes.",

The promised lead time is 4 periods. An order of 210 was placed in Period 1 (expected arrival Period 5). The current on-hand is 0, so stockouts will persist until that order arrives. To maintain inventory for a 5-period horizon (L+1), I need to cover demand for Periods 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Expected total demand (5 periods * 38 units) is ~190 units. With 210 in transit, I am currently covered for the immediate arrival window. However, to ensure continuity for Period 7 and beyond, and considering the lead time of 4, I should start planning for subsequent demand. Since the first shipment is large (210) and covers over 5 periods of demand, I will place a smaller follow-up order to maintain a steady pipeline without over-allocating to holding costs.",

Analysis of the calendar dates (2019/3/25 - 2019/4/8) and demand patterns (P7: 47, P8: 42) indicates a seasonal spike, likely associated with Spring/Easter fashion trends. This is a significant departure from the 'low regime' observed in early March (average ~12 units). We are currently in Period 9 (Date: 2019/4/8). The promised and confirmed lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed today (P9) will arrive in Period 13. My current on-hand inventory is 139 units with 0 in-transit. Based on the heightened demand (approx. 40-50 units/week), the current stock will last approximately 3 weeks (139 / 45 \u2248 3.08), meaning I will likely run out of stock in Period 12, just before any new order arrives in Period 13.

Historical demand reveals distinct regimes: a spring peak (late March/Easter), a massive summer peak (May/June), a July/August lull, and currently, a significant late August/September surge (P28: 70, P29: 116). This recent surge mirrors the summer peak's intensity, potentially driven by 'back-to-school' fashion trends or transition-to-fall wardrobe updates. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 322 units with zero in-transit. While demand has spiked to 116, the holding cost is high ($1/unit vs $4 profit). My current stock of 322 units covers approximately 2.7 weeks of the current high-demand intensity (116 units/week). However, given the volatility observed in previous peaks (like the June drop-off), I must be cautious not to over-order. I will hold off on ordering this period to further deplete the existing surplus and observe if this September surge sustains or begins to taper, as 322 units provides sufficient buffer for the immediate lead-time window if demand stabilizes around 60-80 units.",

Total inventory available is 529 units (279 on-hand + 250 in-transit arriving in P44 resolution). Given the current demand average, we expect approximately 52 units of total demand remaining.

On-hand inventory is 517 units, which is enough to cover current demand levels for approximately 40 weeks, far exceeding the remaining life of the game. Given the high holding cost ($1.00/unit/period) and low profit ($4.00/unit), the existing surplus is already significantly weighing down the total reward.

However, since the simulation ends in Period 47 and the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 46) would not arrive until Period 50, which is well past the game's conclusion.

Most recently, demand spiked in Period 45 (73 units) and Period 46 (70 units), likely corresponding to the Christmas/Holiday retail peak. However, as the game ends this period, any units ordered now would have a 4-period lead time and arrive well after the simulation concludes. With 374 units on-hand and the game terminating at the end of Period 47, the objective is to satisfy the final period's demand from existing stock and avoid any further inventory investment or holding costs.
