Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019/02/11) for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend over the last five weeks: 72, 81, 87, 104, 149. The average demand is 98.6, but the most recent sample (149) suggests a sharp increase in demand as we move deeper into the spring fashion season. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to place a significant initial order. Given the clear upward trend, using all historical samples (default) would underestimate current demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent growth (mean of 87, 104, 149 = 113.3). This will set mu_hat roughly at (1+4)*113.3 = 566.5, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current review period while reflecting the recent demand surge.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for SKU 399256018 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) shows a strong upward trend, increasing from 72 units/week in early January to 195 units/week in Period 1. This likely reflects spring fashion seasonality or a product launch ramp-up. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 167 units in-transit (ordered P1), which resulted in 195 lost sales in Period 1. To address this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the most recent high-demand regime (104, 149, 195). Given Profit ($1) = Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the OR backend will target the mean demand over the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Since L is promised at 4 periods and we have no arrival data yet to suggest otherwise, I'm using the default lead time setting. Using N=3 will result in a mu_hat of approx 746 (149.3 mean * 5 periods), which minus the 167 in pipeline will trigger a significant order to build safety stock and bridge the current inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Weekly demand increased from sub-100 levels in January to 195 in Feb (Period 1), showing a consistent upward trend over the last 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' from the Womens Everyday Collection. Demand has significantly increased as we move from January into February/March, which aligns with spring fashion cycles. The last two periods showed demand of 195 and 179 (avg ~187), compared to the January average of ~88. I am setting N=2 for mu_hat to capture this recent spike while remaining conservative. The promised lead time is 4. Since we are only at Period 3, the first order (placed Period 1) isn't expected to arrive until the Resolution phase of Period 5 (visible in P6). On-hand is currently 0, leading to lost sales, which justifies maintaining a high base stock to recover once shipments arrive. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a higher level (avg ~187) in February compared to January (avg ~88), confirming a seasonal shift into the spring collection.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of skinny ankle jeans from the 'Womens Everyday Collection', entering the spring season (March). Historical demand shows a significant shift from an average of ~86 in January to ~164 in February. Although Period 3 demand dropped to 119, the overall average for the last four weeks (including the Period 1 peak of 195) is ~160. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but 656 units are in-transit. The first order of 167 units from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4 promised), which will be visible in the Period 6 decision phase. Given the seasonal nature of the product and the consistent higher demand in February versus January, I am using a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this newer, higher-demand regime while smoothing out the Period 3 dip. L is kept at 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead-time deviation.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a pair of women's skinny ankle jeans, part of the Everyday Collection. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) showed a peak of 149, while the last 4 periods (Feb-early March) showed a surge to 195 followed by a decline (179, 119, 96). This indicates a post-February peak cooling. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (promised lead time is 4 periods). We are now in Period 5, which means the order placed in Period 1 (167 units) is scheduled to arrive during this period's resolution phase. The total in-transit is 803 units, which matches the sum of orders from P1-P4 (167+225+264+147). Since we have no completed arrivals yet, we stick to the promised lead time of 4. For demand forecasting, the average of the last 4 periods (147.25) is higher than the ancient January samples but lower than the peak. I will use recent_N (N=4) to weight the most recent demand behavior, which likely represents the transition into mid-spring, resulting in a mu_hat of approx 736 (5 * 147.2). This ensures we maintain a sufficient pipeline even as demand slightly retreats from its February high.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility observed after Feb peak: Demand decreased from 195 (P1) to 96 (P4), suggesting a stabilization or correction after the early spring launch.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 with an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, we have 82 units on hand and 636 units in transit. Demand has stabilized following the initial February peak, showing a decline from 195 (P1) to 85 (P5). The average demand over the last four periods (P2-P5) is approximately 119.75. Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Our current total inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 718 units. Expected demand over 5 periods based on the recent average is ~600 units. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility in the 'Womens Everyday Collection', I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods of demand (N=4) to account for the post-launch stabilization, and keep lead time at the default (promised) value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Demand has cooled from the February peak (195) to a more stable range (85-120).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. The product is Ankle-length jeans. Demand has stabilized after the initial February peak (which reached 195 units). The last four recorded demand samples are 119, 96, 85, and 101, averaging 100.25 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. On-hand inventory is 206, and In-transit is 411 (from orders in P3 and P4), totaling 617 units of pipeline inventory. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A mean demand of ~100.25 suggests a base stock requirement of ~500 units. With 617 units already in the system, the OR backend will likely order 0 units this period, which is appropriate given the current stock surplus against recent demand. I am using recent_N=4 to capture this post-peak stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-February peak: avg ~100 units/period (P3-P6) compared to the 149-195 range earlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-48.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/1. We are entering the April sales period for women's ankle jeans. Reviewing history: Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3). Demand exhibits high variance: it spiked in early Feb (195), dropped significantly in March (averaging ~123 across P4-P7), but showed a sharp increase in the most recent period (P7 demand = 211). The current on-hand inventory is 259, with 147 in-transit (ordered P4, expected to arrive in P8 conclusion). Total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) = 406 units. Given the recent spike to 211, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=4: P4-P7) to capture both the low March dip and the recent April-proximate increase, which averages 123.25 per period. The sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture this heightened volatility. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock for potential spring spikes while accounting for the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased entering April: Period 7 demand spiked to 211 after a stable March average of ~94. Observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/08. Demand analysis shows a significant shift entering April. While March demand (P4-P6) averaged approximately 94, Period 7 saw 211 and Period 8 saw 144 units. This indicates a spring demand surge. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P4 arrived in P8). Given the lead time is 4, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). With an avg demand of ~177 over the last 2 weeks, we need to account for this higher regime. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the transition from March stability to April growth, and the same for volatility. The on-hand inventory (262) plus in-transit (211) equals 473 units, providing a decent buffer but requiring a responsive forecast to maintain availability during this uptick.

Carry-over insight: April demand surge confirmed: Average demand increased from ~95 (March) to ~177 (last 2 weeks) for the spring season.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15) demand for women's denim typically remains elevated during mid-spring. Historical demand shows a significant regime change in April: Period 7 (211), Period 8 (144), and Period 9 (113). While demand stabilized somewhat in Period 9, the average of the last 3 periods is ~156, significantly higher than the March average of ~94. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (Period 5-8). There were no arrivals in Period 9 because no order was placed in Period 5, which is consistent with the backend logic. Pipeline inventory is currently 375, and on-hand is 149. To account for the April demand surge while recognizing the slight cooling in the most recent week, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (+/\u2013 156 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of approx 780 (156 * 5). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility seen in the April surge.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the product 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' is in the heart of the spring season. Historical demand shows significant volatility: a high of 211 (P7) and lower points around 88-113 recently. The April average (P8-P10) is approximately 115, a decrease from the late March peak but still higher than the mid-March lull. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on four successful deliveries (P5-P8). Current on-hand inventory is low (61), but a large pipeline (614) is in transit, including the P8 order (211 units) expected to arrive in Period 12. To navigate the current demand regime and upcoming May transition, I will use a restricted window (last 6 periods, P5-P10) to calculate demand stats, which captures the peak and subsequent stabilization. N=6 covers the period from after the launch-stocking phase through the current April fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in April: After a peak of 211 (P7), demand fluctuated between 88-144 (P8-P10), averaging ~115. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 11. The delivery from Period 8 (211 units) is expected to arrive during this period (L=4), though it won't be visible until the next period's start. Demand has stabilized over the last 4 periods (P8-P11) with an average of 108.5 units (144, 113, 88, 89), down from the early April spike of 211. Seasonal knowledge suggests that demand for ankle-length jeans should remain steady or slightly increase as we enter May. I am setting L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent. I'm using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-peak demand regime (averaging ~109 units), which prevents over-ordering based on the late March surge while maintaining enough buffer for May seasonality.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak April demand has stabilized: Period 8-11 average demand is 108.5 units, significantly lower than the P7 spike of 211. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is May 6th. Historically, this product (Womens Ankle-length jeans) saw a demand peak in February (max 195) and another spike in mid-April (211). Recent demand (Periods 8-12) has averaged 113.2 units per period (144, 113, 88, 89, 132). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 8 order in Period 12. With an on-hand inventory of 79 and in-transit inventory of 403 (from orders in P9, P10), we have 482 units to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). At a recent mean of ~113, this is slightly below the required level to maintain a high service level, especially given the stockout in P11. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the stable post-April-peak demand, and a similar window for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is a women's skinny jeans item, which has shown significant demand fluctuations between spring peaks and stabilization periods. Looking at recent history, arrivals from orders placed in Periods 8 and 9 have confirmed the lead time remains precisely 4 periods. The demand for the last four periods (P10-P13) has been 88, 89, 132, and 130, averaging 109.75 units. This indicates a stabilization around 110 units following the erratic swings of April. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this current stable regime while providing sufficient inventory for the review period plus the 4-period lead time. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to reflect current localized volatility. In-transit inventory of 323 units includes orders from P10 (239) and P13 (84), which are expected to arrive in P14 and P17 respectively. Since on-hand is 113 and a large shipment is due this period, the base stock calculation will naturally modulate the order size.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in May (P10-P13) at an average of ~110 units, compared to the higher volatility seen in April.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256018 is a women's denim item. Current date is May 20, 2019. Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P12, P13, and P14). Demand has stabilized after the April volatility, with the last 4 periods (P11-P14) averaging approximately 114 units (89, 132, 130, 106). There are currently 246 units on-hand and 197 units in-transit (orders from P13 and P14), totaling 443 units in pipeline inventory. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (approx 570 units). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which aligns base stock with the mean expected demand over the lead time plus review period. I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for demand to capture the stabilization after the April spikes.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' has stabilized in May (Periods 13-15) with an average of 115.3 units, consistent with the late spring/early summer season. Historically, the lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P12, P13, and P14). Order pipeline analysis: Orders from P13 (84), P14 (113), and P15 (102) are in transit, totaling 299 units. Since the order from Period 12 was effectively 0 (no order placed), we expect the arrival in Period 16 (this period) to be 0 as well. On-hand inventory is 136. To determine the base stock, I am using the most recent volume trend (last 4 periods, P12-P15: 132, 130, 106, 110) where the mean is ~119.5. This captures the current demand regime. Setting L to 4 based on consistent historical performance and mu_hat to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand using recent_N (N=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed steady for late May: Period 12-15 average is 119.5 units, showing lower volatility than April.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399256018 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) shows a stable regime from early May to present (Periods 12-16), with demand averaging 115.6 units and a standard deviation of approximately 13.9. Although April (Periods 7-11) showed higher volatility and a significant spike (211 units), recent weeks have settled into a predictable range. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P12, P13, and P14). I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable regime (Periods 12-16) and avoid over-weighting the April volatility or the February peaks. This N=5 approach provides a balanced forecast for the upcoming L+1 (5) periods, ensuring a targeted stock level while managing holding costs, which are equal to unit profit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Trousers) has stabilized significantly following the April fluctuations. Looking at the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand values were 130, 106, 110, 100, and 79, resulting in a mean of 105. Recent trends show a slight cooling as we enter full summer. The lead time is confirmed at a consistent 4 periods (P13 arrived in P17). Inventory levels are currently low (on-hand 41) but the pipeline is substantial (458 units in-transit). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level target q = 0.5, meaning we target the mean demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable late-spring/early-summer regime while adjusting for the slight downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May/early June: P13-P17 average demand is 105 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399256018 (Ankle Jeans) has stabilized significantly following the April fluctuations. Over the last five periods (P14-P18), demand has averaged 89.4 units, with a noticeable decline to 52 units in the most recent period (P18). This suggests a possible cooling period as we move further into summer. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P17 and P18). Inventory levels are currently healthy with 102 on-hand and 371 in-transit (P15 order of 102 units is expected next period, P16 order of 142 in P20, etc.). To reflect the current stable/slightly declining demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent average and volatility accurately. L is set to 'calculate' to continue utilizing the confirmed 4-period lead time logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected in mid-June: Period 18 demand dropped to 52 units, significantly below the P13-P17 average of 105 units, indicating a potential summer slowdown for this denim SKU.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 20 (June 24th, 2019), we observe a sustained demand drop for this 'Skinny Ankle' denim SKU, likely reflecting a summer seasonal slowdown. Demand in the last two periods (P18-P19) was 52 and 56 units respectively, significantly lower than the May (P14-P17) average of approximately 99 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P13, P14, and P15 exactly 4 periods later. Currently, we have 148 units on-hand and 269 in-transit (total pipeline of 417), which is ample given the current low demand regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward shift immediately, ensuring we don't over-order during this slower period while maintaining enough stock to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand slowdown confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~100 in May to ~54 in the last two periods (P18-P19), consistent with seasonal trends for full-length heavy denim.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently experiencing a significant summer demand slowdown as expected for heavy full-length denim in July. Period 20 demand dropped further to 29 units, confirming the downward trend from 52 and 56 in the preceding weeks. The average demand for the last three periods (P18-P20) is approximately 45.7 units. With on-hand inventory at 261 and in-transit units at 127 (total pipeline 388), and a lead time of 4 periods, we are heavily overstocked relative to the current low-demand regime (388 units covers ~8.5 weeks of demand at current rates). The holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level (q) is 0.5; the engine will aim to carry just enough to avoid excess holding costs. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this summer trough and maintain lead time 'L' as 'calculate' since it has been stable at 4 periods. No new orders are likely to be triggered due to high inventory, which is appropriate to minimize holding costs during this slow period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough deepening: P18-P20 average demand dropped to ~46 units, compared to the ~54 average reported at P20, showing a continued decline for full-length heavy denim in July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019, which is the height of summer. The product 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans (full-length, heavy denim) is experiencing a sharp seasonal demand decline as reflected in the last four periods (52, 56, 29, 32). The average demand for the last 4 periods is 42.25 units, compared to the spring average of ~110. On-hand inventory is very high (330 units) due to the arrival of orders placed during higher-demand periods (P14-P17) while actual demand dropped. With on-hand inventory (330) and in-transit units (26) totaling 356 units, and expected demand for the (L+1) horizon being significantly lower (approx. 250 units), we are overstocked. No new orders should be placed until inventory levels align with current summer demand. I am setting L to 4 as observed lead times are perfectly consistent, and mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the summer trough. The OR backend will naturally zero out new orders because base_stock will be less than the current pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough established: P18-P21 average demand is 42.25 units, confirmng a ~60% drop from the May average (~110). Current inventory levels (330) significantly exceed the expected demand for the lead time horizon.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical demand shows a confirmed summer seasonal trough for this skinny ankle denim SKU. Demand has dropped from a May average of ~110 units to a much lower average of 39 units over the last 5 periods (P18-P22). With 317 units currently on-hand and zero units in transit, the current inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 8 weeks of demand at the current rate (317 / 39 \u2248 8.1), which exceeds the (L+1) horizon of 5 weeks. Given that profit per unit ($1.0) is equal to the holding cost ($1.0), the system should avoid holding excess stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the stabilized summer demand regime, and set L to default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand mid-point: P18-P22 average demand is stabilized at 41.6 units, reflecting the seasonal low for heavy denim.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a pair of ankle-length jeans, which is currently in its seasonal trough as established in periods 18-23. Demand has consistently stayed between 29-56 units per period over the last six weeks, significantly lower than the May/April peaks. With 280 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, the current inventory level covers roughly 7 periods of demand at the current average rate (avg of P18-P23 = 40.8 units). Since the lead time is 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand and the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), making it critical to avoid ordering more until inventory burns down. I will set the demand forecast using N=6 to capture the established summer trough (Period 18-23), which will result in no new orders from the OR backend because on-hand exceeds the calculated base stock for this low-demand regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in the depths of the summer demand trough for heavy denim (Skinny Ankle Jeans). Demand has been extremely low and stable over the last seven periods (P18-P24), ranging from 29 to 56 units, with an average of approximately 39.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 250 units, which covers over 6 periods of demand at the current rate. With a lead time of 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked relative to current sales. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods throughout the cycle. Since we have enough stock to cover the lead time plus current demand without any new orders, and since holding costs equal the profit per unit ($1.00), the goal is to carry as little excess inventory as possible. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect the summer regime (P18-P24).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for denim remains floor-level: average demand for P18-P24 is ~39 units, representing a stable seasonal low. No new orders placed for 6 consecutive periods due to high on-hand coverage.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, and the product is a skinny denim jean. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal decline starting in June (mid-summer), with average weekly demand dropping from ~110 units in May to ~39 units (P18-P25 average). Last period's demand was 29 units, confirming the trough continues. On-hand inventory is 221 units, which at the current burn rate of ~39 units/week, covers more than 5 periods (exceeding the lead time coverage of L+1 = 5). No in-transit orders remain, as the last small order from P18 arrived in P22. To avoid further accumulation of holding costs while demand is at its seasonal floor, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the summer demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the confirmed lead time of 4. Given the inventory level, the backend will likely not place an order, which is correct until inventory depletes further or demand recovers.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a summer trough but shows a slight uptick in Period 26 demand (74 units) compared to the July average (~35 units). As we move into mid-August (2019/8/12), we anticipate the start of the 'Back to School' and transition to autumn demand. Historically, the skinny ankle jeans SKU saw significantly higher demand in Feb/March (approx 100-200). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 147 units with no in-transit. To prepare for the upcoming seasonal shift while avoiding excessive holding costs (which equal profit), I will use a recent demand window that captures the late summer trend. I'll set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P22-P26) which average ~42 units, providing an (L+1) coverage for a base stock of ~210. Given on-hand is 147, this will trigger a modest order of ~63 units, positioning inventory for the gradual autumn ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Early signs of autumn recovery: Period 26 demand (74 units) is double the July average (~35 units), suggesting the start of a seasonal transition.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering late August (2019/8/19), which historically signals the transition from the summer trough (where demand was ~35-40 units) to the autumn recovery for denim products. Period 26 and 27 demand (74 and 75 units respectively) confirm this shift, being nearly double the July average. The on-hand inventory is 72, and there is an in-transit shipment of 62 arriving around Period 31 (placed Period 27). Total coverage (on-hand + in-transit) is 134 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for approximately 5 periods (P28-P32). Based on the recent uptick, I estimate demand to continue rising toward the 100-110 level seen in the late spring. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (encompassing the start of the recovery) will under-forecast slightly because it includes one low July point; therefore, I will use an explicit forecast of 450 units for the next (1+L) periods (approx 90 units/period) to guarantee sufficient stock for the intensifying autumn demand while accounting for the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Demand in August (P26-P27) has stabilized at ~75 units, a 100% increase over the July average (~37 units), signaling the end of the summer trough for denim.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' (Women's Skinny Ankle Jeans) is exiting its summer demand trough (approx. 40 units/period) and entering an autumn recovery phase. Demand in the last three periods (P26-P28) was 74, 75, and 85, showing a clear upward trend and stabilizing at approximately double the summer low. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P18 order arrived P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the supply gap during the transition, but 196 units are in transit (62 from P27, 134 from P28). To cover the L+1 (5 period) horizon, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the new autumn demand level (avg ~78 * 5 = 390). Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures the current transition volatility. This ensures the OR backend places sufficient orders to rebuild stock for the recovery while accounting for the significant pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery demand regime confirmed: P26-P28 average demand is 78 units, up from the July trough of ~35 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the beginning of September (2019/9/2). Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern for these ankle-length jeans: a peak in February/April (avg ~150), a significant summer trough in June/July (avg ~40), and a recent autumn recovery starting in August. Demand in Period 26-28 averaged 78 units, though Period 29 showed a dip to 45. The 'In-transit' inventory is 285 units (from orders in P27, P28, P29), but current on-hand is 0, meaning we are temporarily out of stock until the order from Period 27 arrives (expected in Period 31, visible P32). Since lead time has been consistently 4 units, I will set L to 'calculate'. For demand (mu_hat), the last 4 periods (P26-P29) represent the new autumn regime (avg ~70), which is more relevant than the summer trough or spring peak. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this recovery while smoothing the P29 dip. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility of this transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery demand regime (P26-P29) is established at an average of ~70 units, a 75% increase over the summer trough (avg ~40).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans is in an autumn recovery phase (P26-P30), averaging approximately 67 units over the last 5 periods (74, 75, 85, 45, 58). This is a significant increase from the July trough (~35-40 units) but remains below the spring peak (>100 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 28. In-transit inventory is 349 units, but these were ordered between Period 27 and 30, meaning they are still within the promised lead time of 4 periods and have not yet arrived. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods in previous arrivals. To manage the current recovery, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current autumn baseline (average ~67), which results in a total demand forecast of ~335 over the L+1 horizon. Although in-transit (349) technically covers this, the OR engine's service level logic and the recent stockout necessitate maintaining steady parameters to ensure the replenishment pipeline stays active as demand stabilizes.

The P28 order (134 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P32), as lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P27 order arrived in P31). Based on the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) = 5 periods. Using the established autumn recovery average of ~70 units, the expected demand over the horizon is 350 units. With 287 in-transit, additional ordering is needed to bridge the gap and maintain service levels as we head into late September.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at ~71 units (P26-P31 average), confirming recovery from summer troughs.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late September/early October period (Autumn). Looking at the history, demand has transitioned from the summer trough (avg ~40) to an established autumn recovery regime (P26-P32). In the last 7 periods (P26-P32), demand has been: 74, 75, 85, 45, 58, 86, 60. The average demand for this regime is approximately 69. Inflation in volatility is noted as demand fluctuates between 45 and 86. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by multiple arrivals in P31 and P32). Pipeline inventory is currently 219 (orders from P29, P30, P32), and on-hand is 74, totaling 293 units. Given the lead time of 4 and a review period of 1, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. With a mean of ~69, the expected demand is 345 units. Current total inventory (293) is slightly below this target, so an order should be triggered. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current autumn demand behavior while maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October, and historical data plus product description suggest a sustained autumn demand regime for everyday denim. Current demand for the autumn recovery (P26-P33) averages 73.1 units. The most recent demand (P33) was 101, but the average since late August (P29) has been approximately 76 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 62 and in-transit at 182 (P30: 64, P32: 66, P33: 52), total pipeline coverage is 244 units. At the current demand rate, this covers roughly 3.2 periods of the 5-period horizon (L+1). I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the autumn regime mean (~73) and sigma to ensure adequate service levels as we move deeper into the cooler months.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery demand (P26-P33) has established a stable regime with an average of 73 units, double the summer trough (avg ~40) but still below the spring peak (~110).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a stable 'Autumn Recovery' phase for these ankle-length jeans. Demand in the last nine periods (P26-P34) has averaged 74 units, significantly higher than the summer trough of ~40 units. Recent weeks (P31-P34) show a slight upward lift with an average of 81.75 units. I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized autumn regime and ensure inventory levels are aligned with this higher baseline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to reflect the current moderate volatility observed during the recovery. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion of shipments from P27 through P30. On-hand plus pipeline (46 + 221 = 267) currently covers the next ~3.3 periods of demand, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to bridge the gap and satisfy the lead-time risk.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. The SKU is a skinny ankle jean (Womens Everyday), which typically experiences stable demand in autumn. Since the autumn recovery began in Period 26, the demand regime has remained remarkably stable with an average of 73 units (P26-P35 range: 45 to 101). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a slight demand overshoot in P35, but in-transit inventory is 323 units, with the largest shipment (P32 order of 66) expected to arrive in Period 36 and become usable in Period 37. I will set mu_hat to cover the lead time + review period (5 periods) using the recent N=10 samples (P26-P35) to reflect this established autumn regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the current stable 73 units/week average and maintains adequate service levels while waiting for the pipeline to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P26-P35) is firmly established at an average of 73 units, with moderate volatility (range: 45-101). No significant changes for 10 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans is in a stable autumn regime. Period 36 demand was 71 units, closely aligning with the established autumn average of approximately 73 units (P26-P35). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. Inventory currently shows 0 units on-hand with 303 units in-transit (orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36). With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (tracking the regime since the autumn recovery began in P26) to capture the current stable demand level while ignoring the summer trough.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for this denim SKU has remained stable since the autumn recovery began in August (Period 26). Specifically, the average demand from P26 to P37 is approximately 75 units, which is consistent with the 'Autumn demand regime' identified in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand (P34-P37: 80, 73, 71, 84) shows very low volatility around this mean. The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, with 316 units in-transit. These in-transit units include orders from P34 (103), P35 (102), P36 (46), and P37 (65). The P34 order (103 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P38) and become visible in the next Period 38 conclude message. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the entire 'Autumn' regime since P26 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring we maintain sufficient stock for this stable 75-unit/week demand pattern.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the autumn/winter season for this skinny ankle jeans SKU. Demand has been stable since the August recovery (Period 26), with the average demand from P26 to P38 being approximately 73 units. The most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) show an average demand of 77 units, indicating a slight upward trend as we move further into the colder months. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is low (34 units), but in-transit inventory is significant (269 units). To maintain service levels during this stable autumn regime while avoiding excessive holding costs, I will use recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=13 (covering the start of the autumn recovery at P26) to capture the current stable demand environment accurately.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The SKU (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is in its autumn/winter steady state. Over the last 14 periods (P26-P39), demand has stabilized with an average of approximately 73 units per period (ranging from 45 to 101). Recent demand (P35-P39) shows a slight cooling to an average of 70 units. Lead time remains very consistent at exactly 4 periods based on the most recent five arrivals (P32-P36 and P38-P39 all arrived with lead_time=4). On-hand inventory is 73, and there are 234 units in-transit (orders from P36, P37, P38, and P39). I will use the established autumn regime (last 14 samples) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand while avoiding overstocking as we move further into the season.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for the 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' (trousers/denim) has remained stable within the autumn regime, with the last 5 periods (P36-P40) averaging 67.2 units. The broader autumn recovery period (P26-P40) shows a mean of 72.8 units with a standard deviation of 14.5. On-hand inventory is 70, and there is 247 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the date is approaching late November, there is no evidence yet of a winter/holiday spike for this specific item, so I will maintain the stable autumn forecasting parameters. I'm using N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire stabilized autumn period since the recovery began in August.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product is a staple item ('Everyday Collection') ankle-length jean. Demand has remained remarkably stable since the autumn recovery began around Period 26 (August). Over the last 15 periods (P26-P41), the average demand is 71.9 units. Specifically, over the most recent 10 periods (P32-P41), the average is 71.1 units with relatively low volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 74, and in-transit inventory is 223 units, totaling 297 units. Given the target service level (q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5), the base stock should roughly cover (L+1) periods of demand, which is approximately 5 * 71 = 355 units. I will use recent_N to capture this stable autumn/winter regime. N=10 is selected to reflect the most stable recent demand trend while filtering out the transition from the summer trough.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Recent demand history indicates a significant spike in Period 42 (114) following a stable period (avg ~60-70). This spike aligns with typical 'Cyber Monday' or early December holiday shopping patterns for 'Womens Everyday Collection' trousers. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 38 order. On-hand inventory is low (16), but the pipeline is healthy with 226 units in transit. Given the late-year seasonality, I am using a larger window (N=17) for mu_hat to capture the broader autumn/winter base demand while allowing the OR engine's service level logic to handle the recent volatility. This window (covering P26-P42) averages ~75 units per period. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to better reflect the increased volatility seen as we enter the holiday season compared to the very stable mid-autumn period.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand increased to 114, nearly doubling the previous 3-period average (61) as the calendar transitions into December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We are in the middle of the holiday season for this 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim SKU. Last period (P42) saw a significant demand spike to 114 units, whereas P43 dropped to 48 units. This volatility is typical for December retailing, where gift-giving and seasonal events create sharp demand fluctuations. The carry-over insight from P43 noted the 114 spike as a holiday signal. Looking at the inventory, on-hand is low (35), but in-transit is high (265). Promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (the P39 order arrived exactly on time in P43). To manage the remaining weeks of the game (ending P47), I need to account for potential pre-Christmas spikes. I will use a recent demand window to capture the holiday volatility, setting N=6 to include the November stability and the December spike (approx. mean ~64, but the spike suggests an upward bias). I'll use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been consistently 4 units. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to reflect the increased holiday variance.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand volatility confirmed in December: demand fluctuates between high-tide spikes (114 in P42) and troughs (48 in P43). Current stock-on-hand is low (35 units) entering the mid-December peak weeks.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-December (2019/12/16), entering the peak holiday shopping weeks. Historically, Period 42 showed a spike to 114 units, followed by a local trough around 48 units. However, looking at the lead time of 4 periods, any decision made now will arrive in Period 49 (after the system ends at Period 47). While the game ends at P47, the objective is to optimize the base stock for the current environment. Inventory on-hand (47) and in-transit (243) provide a total pipeline of 290 units. Given the recent holiday volatility and the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering Periods 40-44) to capture the current holiday regime average which is approx 64 units per period. This results in a mu_hat of approx 320 (5 * 64). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-December holiday demand regime (P40-P44) is averaging 63.8 units with high volatility (range 47-114).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (Dec 23) represents the peak of the holiday shopping season for this women's everyday denim SKU. Although recent demand (P43-P45) has been relatively low (avg ~48), the calendar context suggests a high likelihood of a late-season surge or post-holiday clearance activity. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With only 39 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 231 units (ordered P42-P45), we are entering the final weeks of the year. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent 6-period average (N=6, covering P40-P45, avg ~61) to capture the pre-holiday shifts, rather than just the last 3 low-demand weeks, ensuring the base stock level remains robust against holiday volatility. The sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect this elevated seasonal variance. The OR backend's capped policy will prevent over-ordering relative to the pipeline while maintaining a safe service level for the upcoming periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30, moving into the post-holiday/New Year period. Holiday demand (P42-P46) averaged ~60 units, significantly lower than the P42 spike of 114, indicating the holiday peak has passed. Historically, early January (P1 data point) started at 72 units. Currently, on-hand is 57 and in-transit is 209 (P43-P46 orders, totaling 106+37+29+37 = 209). This pipeline is very healthy, covering approximately 4.4 periods of demand at a 60-unit average, or 3.7 periods at a higher 80-unit forecast. Since the promised lead time L=4 is consistent, and current pipeline + inventory (266 units) nearly covers the (L+1) horizon, I will use recent statistics to maintain a stable replenishment, slightly favoring more recent post-peak data (last 5 weeks) to avoid over-ordering as we exit the holiday season.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak has concluded: demand dropped from 114 (P42) to an average of ~46 units in the subsequent 4 periods (P43-P46).
