Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a staple apparel item. Demand for socks is generally stable, though may see some uptick during seasonal transitions. Since this is the first period, the on-hand inventory and in-transit units are zero. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand data from the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows values: 28, 38, 34, 44, 41. This shows a slightly increasing trend (mean \u2248 37). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand level (approx 37 units/period). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target window is (1+L)=5 periods. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover expected demand plus safety stock based on profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1). Given the lack of lead time history, I will use the 'default' lead time (4).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical demand from Jan to early Feb shows a mean of approximately 37.8 units per week (28, 38, 34, 44, 41). Period 1 actual demand was 43. No stock was available to satisfy this, resulting in lost sales. I have 48 units in-transit from Period 1's order, which is expected to arrive in Period 5 given the 4-period promised lead time. Since on-hand is 0, the priority is to establish a pipeline that covers demand for (L+1) periods. Using a mean of roughly 40 units/week and L=4, the base stock should targets around (1+4)*40 = 200 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (including all available historical data + Period 1) to capture the current demand level.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) managing a SKU described as 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Current on-hand is 0, with 97 units in transit. Historical demand shows 43 (P1) and 66 (P2), compared to the pre-game samples (avg 37.8). There is a visible upward trend in demand as we approach Spring (late Feb), which is consistent with 'trainer socks' seasonality. The promised lead time is 4. Following the execution sequence, orders from P1 (lead time 4) are expected to arrive in Period 5. Since we currently have 0 on-hand and 97 in transit against a rising demand, the OR backend's capped policy will manage the pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 (including pre-game samples and recent observations) to account for the recent demand increase (mean of last 5: 44, 41, 43, 66 -> approx 46.6 vs initial 37). L and sigma_hat remain at default/calculate to establish a baseline while volatility is still being assessed.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/4. The product is Women's Fine-knit trainer socks. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~37 units/week. However, the last three periods (Feb 11 - Feb 25) show a significant increase in demand (43, 66, 57), averaging ~55.3 units/week. This suggests a demand regime shift as we move into spring (trainer socks seasonality). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are in Period 4, the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message read at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 163 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3). To ensure we cover demand during the lead time plus one review period (L+1=5), I am using 'recent_N' for demand (N=3) to capture the higher recent volume, and keeping the default lead time. Sigma is also calculated from the recent 3 periods to account for the increased volatility observed in the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Average weekly demand increased from ~37 to ~55 units (+48%) coinciding with early spring trainer sock seasonality.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees a seasonal rise in demand as the weather warms (early spring). Historical demand samples (Period 1-4 conclude) show a mean of 52.5 (43, 66, 57, 44), significantly higher than the initial pre-game samples (avg 37). The Carry-Over Insight correctly flagged this shift (+48%). Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, P3, and P4 haven't arrived yet, which is consistent with L=4. The P1 order is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of P5 and will be visible in the P6 START report. Because we have 0 on-hand inventory and the first shipment is only due to arrive this period (available for next period's demand), we must continue to maintain a robust pipeline. I will set L to 'default' (4) as no actual lead-time data has concluded yet. I'll use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current active regime (avg 52.5). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' (N=4) to reflect the volatility of this new demand level.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees a seasonal uptick in spring. The first historical arrival (ordered P1, arrived P5) confirms the promised lead time (L=4). Demand from 2019-02-11 onward (Periods 1-5) shows a higher mean (~50.6) compared to the initial 5 samples (~37). On-hand inventory is very low (5 units), but there is a large pipeline (256 units), including orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5. Specifically, the P2 order (49 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P6). I will use L=4 and set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the higher demand regime since P1). The OR backend's cap mechanism will likely suppress a large new order because the pipeline (256) already significantly exceeds the expected base stock for L=4, which is appropriate given the current high level of in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1026.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 7 (2019/3/25), we are managing 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically see a seasonal increase in demand during spring. Historical data and recent game history confirm a demand shift: initial samples (Jan) averaged ~37, while the most recent 6 periods (since Feb 11) average ~54.5 units per week. Specifically, the last two periods saw high demand (43 and 73). However, we are currently experiencing a stockout (ending on-hand=0) despite arrivals, because demand is outpacing our current stock levels. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being met (orders from P1 and P2 arrived exactly after 4 periods). We have 238 units in-transit (orders from P3 to P6), which should begin arriving next period. To capture the higher seasonal demand and recover from stockouts, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) of actual demand history (the new regime) and use the same window for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (Std Dev ~12.5). This will push the base stock higher to provide a better service level for this high-margin product ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Mean demand from Period 1 to Period 6 is 54.3, significantly higher than the initial Jan baseline of ~37. Spring seasonality for trainer socks is confirmed.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. The product is trainer socks, which are experiencing a strong seasonal uptick as spring progresses. Demand in Period 7 jumped to 98 units, while the previous 6-week average was ~54. The total demand history (Period 1-7) shows a mean of 60.5 and a standard deviation of 19.3. On-hand inventory is CURRENTLY 0, but 248 units are in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). Specifically, the P4 order (75 units) is expected to arrive during P8 resolution. Given the jump in Period 7 (98 units), I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the accelerating spring sales (avg P4-P7 is 70.75 units), which results in a mu_hat of ~354 for (1+L) periods. Lead time (L) is stable at the promised 4 periods (confirmed by P5, P6, P7 arrivals).

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration observed: Period 7 demand (98) is significantly higher than the P1-P6 average (54), indicating a peak in spring trainer sock seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1365.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, and demand for 'fine-knit trainer socks' is entering its peak seasonal period. Historical data shows a clear upward trend: January mean of 37 vs. Period 1-6 mean of 54.3 vs. Period 7-8 peak mean of 85. Our current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), though we have 272 units in-transit. Based on the 'conclude' messages, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). This confirms we can trust the promised lead time of 4. Given the recent demand jump starting at Period 7 (98 and 72 units), I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher seasonal mean (avg of P6-P8 is 81), which over L+1 (5) periods equals 405. For volatility, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the increased variance seen since the seasonality began in March. These parameters aim to replenish inventory quickly to avoid lost sales during this peak period while being mindful of the capping logic.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for trainer socks: Period 7 and 8 avg demand is 85, significantly higher than the previous 54.3 mean. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand during spring as the weather warms. Historical data shows a clear regime shift: Jan/Feb mean was ~37, Feb/Mar mean was ~54, and the last three periods (P7-P9) have averaged 79.7 units (98, 72, 69). Despite a slight cooling in the last two weeks, we are still well above the earlier regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (arrived consistently at L=4). However, current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts or near-stockouts in periods 6, 7, and 9. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). To prevent further lost sales during this sustained high-demand spring period, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher mean (approx 78 units/period) and provide enough safety stock (sigma_hat) to handle the recent volatility observed (demand range 69 to 98).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime for trainer socks confirmed: Periods 7-9 average demand is 79.7, up from the P1-P6 average of 54.3. Seasonal peak is active.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which is in its peak spring/early summer season. Demand from Period 7 to Period 10 has averaged 79.25 units per week, significantly higher than the early February baseline of 37 or the mid-regime of 54. Historical samples from January (28, 38, 34, 44, 41) also confirm that current demand is roughly double the winter levels. We have experienced stockouts in 5 of the last 6 periods due to this sustained high demand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit at 395 (spread across periods 7-10), we need to maintain a robust base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the current period (1). I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current high-demand seasonal peak (mean ~79). This will instruct the OR backend to set base_stock = (1+4) * 79.25 plus a safety buffer, ensuring we catch up to the seasonal trend while in-transit orders arrive to fill the pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Fine-knit trainer socks' is in a high-demand spring seasonal peak. Current demand is extremely strong, with 116 units requested in Period 11, following a multi-week trend averaging ~85 units (P7-P11). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, despite a recent arrival of 76 units, indicating we are under-stocked relative to demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since demand has accelerated and the spring peak is fully active (confirmed by carry-over insights), I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent history to capture this higher mean. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the periods from P7 to P11 where demand averaged 86.6. Calculating mu_hat over (1+L) periods, where L=4, means (1+4)*86.6 = 433. The chosen parameters aim to raise the base stock level to satisfy this peak demand and recover from stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal peak intensified: Weekly demand from Period 7 to Period 11 has averaged 86.6 units, compared to the previous regime of ~54 units (+60% increase). Inventory is struggling to keep pace with demand realization.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860024 (Fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in its peak spring season (early May). Demand has significantly shifted twice: first increasing from ~37 in January to ~54 in early March, and then accelerating further from Period 7 (March 25) onwards. Over the last 6 periods (P7-P12), the average demand is 89.1 units (98, 72, 69, 78, 116, 102), with high volatility. We are currently experiencing frequent stockouts because current arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are lagging behind the accelerated demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this seasonal peak, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture this higher demand regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the current 89+ unit/week demand over the lead time plus review period (5 periods total).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand peak confirmed: Period 7 to Period 12 average demand is 89.1 units, representing a second major regime shift from the earlier average of ~54 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13), following a period of high demand for trainer socks driven by spring seasonality. In Period 13, however, demand dropped significantly to 61 units from the previous 5-period average of ~86 units. This deceleration potentially indicates the peak of the spring trainer sock season has passed. Lead times remain consistent at exactly 4 periods. The the stock position is improving with 58 units on-hand and 392 units in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is still required, but it is prudent to stabilize the forecast rather than aggressively chase the extremely high peaks of Periods 7, 8, and 11. I am selecting N=7 for mu_hat to capture the 'peak' regime (Periods 7-13: mean ~85) while incorporating the most recent downturn, which helps smooth the forecast as seasonality potentially wanes. I will use N=7 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the higher volatility observed during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed in Period 13 (61 units), potentially signaling the end of the spring seasonal peak for trainer socks (previous 6-period mean was 89.1).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860024 (trainer socks) is transitioning out of its peak spring season (late March to early May). Current demand (Period 13: 61, Period 14: 74) shows a clear deceleration compared to the peak average of ~90 units observed between Periods 7 and 12. As we move into late May, I expect demand to stabilize at a lower post-peak mean but still remain higher than the January/February baseline. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this cooling trend (average demand over P12-P14 is 79), which ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock downward to prevent excess inventory as seasonality fades. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is being used to calculate the pipeline requirements. With 85 units on hand and 342 in-transit, the system is well-covered for the next several periods, and my parameters will allow the OR engine to modulate ordering to match the slowing demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration from spring peak confirmed: average demand dropped from 89.1 (P7-P12) to 67.5 (P13-P14), a ~24% reduction as of May 20th.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27th, late spring. Demand for trainer socks peaked between Period 7 and Period 12 (avg ~89 units) and has recently decelerated (P13-P15 avg ~70 units). This indicates the post-peak stability phase of spring seasonality. The inventory position is currently healthy with 59 units on-hand and 338 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the peak). Lead time throughout the game has been perfectly stable at 4 periods. Given the cooling demand, I am using a recent window (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering based on the high-peak demand from April (Periods 7-12). A 3-period window (P13-P15) captures the current post-peak regime (70.3 units/period) better than long-term averages. L is set to calculate as observed lead times are consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Post-peak spring demand for trainer socks (May 6th to May 20th) has stabilized around an average of 70 units per period, down significantly from the peak average of 89 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860024' (fine-knit trainer socks) is exiting its peak spring seasonality. Demand peaked between Periods 7-12 (avg ~89) and has since decelerated. The most recent demand (Period 16) returned to near-peak levels (102 units), but the preceding three periods (P13-P15) showed an average of ~70 units. Given the transition into early June, demand is likely to remain relatively high but volatile. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 77, with 218 units in-transit (orders from P13-P15). I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P13-P16) to capture the post-peak mean (~78 units per period), which remains higher than the initial Jan/Feb baseline. Sigma_hat is set using the same period to account for the recent volatility (range 61-102).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860024' (fine-knit trainer socks) is now in the post-peak spring demand phase. Analysis of recent demand (Period 13 to Period 17) shows values of 61, 74, 76, 102, and 76. While Period 16 was an outlier (102), the general cluster is around 75 units per week, significantly lower than the April peak (~90) but higher than the February baseline (~40). I am setting N=5 for both mean and variance to capture this stabilized 'late spring/early summer' regime while dampening the effect of the April peak data. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent delivery (P13 order arrived P17). The current inventory position (On-hand: 122, In-transit: 204) is robust against the current demand levels, so the OR engine will likely moderate ordering to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the current profit/holding cost ratio (95%).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: Average demand from Period 13-17 is 77.8 units, establishing a new stable regime after the spring seasonal peak.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 17, 2019 (Period 19), SKU 372860024 (trainer socks) is in a post-peak seasonal stabilization phase. The historical data show highly consistent lead times of 4 periods. Since the spring peak (roughly Periods 7-12, mean ~89), demand has shifted to a lower, more stable regime. The recent demand samples are: P13=61, P14=74, P15=76, P16=102, P17=76, P18=66. The average demand across these last 6 periods is 75.8 units. Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 for both mean and standard deviation will capture this current regime while smoothing the variance seen in P16. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period timing has been perfectly consistent, allowing the OR backend to use the observed history. This strategy balances the need to maintain stock for a steady summer demand while avoiding excessive holding costs now that the spring surge is over.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are managing 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal item. Following the spring peak (Periods 7-12, avg ~89), demand has transitioned into a post-peak summer stabilization regime. Over the most recent 7 periods (P13-P19), demand has averaged 77.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14 units. The 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 18 correctly identified this stabilization around 77.8. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-peak demand profile (since Period 13), being more responsive than the 'default' method but more stable than very short-term filters. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5, so I will maintain the 'default' lead time setting.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. We are in a post-peak spring demand phase for trainer socks, which historically stabilized around an average of 77.8 units (Period 13-17). However, looking at the lead time resolution, Period 20 conclude shows arrived=0 for an order placed in Period 16. Checking history, Period 16 shows ordered=0, which explains why nothing arrived. This results in our current on-hand inventory being 0. Pipeline inventory is healthy (370 units in-transit). Demand in the last three periods (P18-P20) has been 66, 86, and 69, averaging 73.6 units, which is consistent with the post-peak 'stable' regime observed since mid-May. I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8, covering P13-P20) to capture this post-peak behavior (mean ~76.5) and provide a buffer for the current zero-inventory situation. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees sustained demand throughout the summer. Demand history from Period 13 to Period 21 shows a stable post-spring-peak regime with an average of approximately 76.4 units per period (61, 74, 76, 102, 76, 66, 86, 69, 78). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods, with the exception of the Period 16 order (missing from 'conclude' messages so far, though in-transit shows it was likely zero-unit order or skipped). The Period 17 order (107 units) arrived on Period 21. Period 20 'conclude' showed 0 units arrived, but on-hand was 0 and demand was 69; note that Period 16 had an order of 0 units, which explains the 0 arrival in Period 20 (ordered P16, arrive P20). Currently, on-hand is 29 and in-transit is 322 (comprising orders from P18: 103, P19: 69, P20: 91, P21: 59). To maintain service levels during this stable summer regime, I will use a N=9 period window for mu_hat to capture the most recent stable average (~76.4) and sigma_hat calculation. Lead time is set to default (4).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which saw a significant spring demand peak and has now stabilized into a summer regime. Recent demand over the last 10 periods (P13-P22) has averaged 77.5 units, with the most recent two periods steady at 78 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of orders from P17 and P18 exactly 4 periods later. The gap in Period 20 (where ordered units from P16 were expected) reflects the order of '0' units placed in P16, not a shipment failure. On-hand inventory is 54 and pipeline inventory is 295. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the post-peak stable demand mean and variance, which better reflects current summer demand levels compared to the full historical average or the earlier spring peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1337.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is fine-knit trainer socks, which historically show strong spring/summer demand. We are currently in late July (Period 24). Analyzing recent history: the spring peak (Period 7-12) averaged ~89 units, while the post-peak period (Period 13-23) has settled into a stable regime averaging 77 units (range of 61-102). Period 23 demand was 73 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with the exception of the Period 16 order (ordered zero) and Period 20 showing no arrival because none was ordered in Period 16. On-hand inventory is 50, and pipeline inventory is 302 units (which reflects the high orders from periods 20-23). Due to the current steady state (mean ~77), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand mean and lead time, with N=11 to cover the stable post-peak regime from Period 13 onwards (11 observations). This provides a robust forecast for the OR engine while accounting for the lower volatility compared to the spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Post-peak spring/early summer demand (P13-P23) has stabilized at an average of 77 units/period, down from the peak average of 89 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/29. We are in a stable post-spring/early summer demand regime for trainer socks. Analyzing the demand from Period 13 to Period 24, the average weekly demand is approximately 77.2 units (total demand 927 units over 12 periods). The most recent observation (Period 24) shows demand of 69, which is slightly lower but consistent with the established regime. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods, with the exception of Period 20's order which arrived in Period 24 (confirming lead_time = 4). No shipments appear to be lost. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture this stabilized 'summer' regime (P13-P24), which covers roughly 3 months of data. This will provide a reliable estimate for the current demand level while ignoring the earlier high-intensity seasonal peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is in a stable post-spring/early-summer demand regime. Analysis of demand from Period 13 to Period 25 shows a mean of 74.8 units per week (min 61, max 102), confirming the Carry-over Insight that demand has stabilized around ~75-77 units following the spring peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25). Based on this stable regime (P13-P25), I will use a recent_N approach with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-peak behavior. Although there was an order placed in Period 16 for 0 units, the pipeline inventory has since recovered and currently stands at 287 units, which is approximately 3.8 weeks of demand at the current rate. The OR engine will use the provided base stock parameters to maintain an appropriate safety stock for this stable 75-unit-per-week regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has shown a slight downward trend over the last 4 periods (69, 63, 51, and the current state), likely reflecting the transition from mid-summer into late summer/early autumn. The average demand over the last 14 periods (P13-P26) is approximately 73 units, but the most recent 5 periods show a lower average of 64.4 units. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this cooling demand for mu_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P22 ordered P18 arrived P22; P23 ordered P19 arrived P23, etc.). The pipeline inventory (269) and on-hand inventory (93) are healthy, so a slightly more conservative forecast will help avoid excessive holding costs as the seasonal peak for trainer socks continues to wind down.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed: Average demand for trainer socks dropped to 64.4 units over periods 22-26, compared to the previous post-peak average of 77 units, signaling late-season tapering.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which exhibit strong seasonality. We are currently in a late-summer tapering phase. Historically, demand peaked in Spring (P7-P12 avg ~89) and stabilized in early summer (P13-P23 avg ~77). Recent data (P24-P27) shows a further decline to an average of 61.75 units (69, 63, 51, 64). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this downward trend into late August/September, as trainer socks typically see reduced demand moving into Autumn. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand (105) and in-transit (201) are sufficient to cover the immediate pipeline, so the OR backend will likely generate a smaller order to avoid excess holding costs as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand tapering confirmed: Average demand for periods 24-27 is 61.8 units, down from the previous stabilization level of 77 units (-20%).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are in a late-summer tapering phase for trainer socks. Based on Period 28's conclusion, the demand for the last four periods (P25-P28) was 63, 51, 64, and 53, averaging 57.75 units. This confirms the late-season deceleration identified in the carry-over insights (down from the previous stabilization mean of ~77). Lead times remain consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 122 and 162 units in-transit (orders from P25, P26, P27, P28), our pipeline is healthy. I will set L to 4 using the calculate method (consistent delivery), and mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current lower demand regime (avg ~58/period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to capture the current volatility of this late-summer period. This prevents over-ordering as the season concludes.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from Period 25 to Period 28 is 57.8 units, down significantly from the post-peak average of ~77 units (-25%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. We are observing a significant late-summer demand tapering for trainer socks. Demand over the last 4 periods (P26-P29) has averaged 59.25 units, which is a clear step down from the previous post-peak stabilization level of approximately 77 units. The carry-over insights confirm this sustained deceleration. To align with this new lower-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the last 5 samples: 69, 53, 64, 51, 63) to capture the trend while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P29 order from P25 arrived with lead_time=4). Current on-hand (118) and in-transit (127) represent a significant stock level relative to this slowing demand, so the OR backend will naturally reduce order quantities to avoid excess holding costs as the season ends.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9th, 2019. We are managing fine-knit trainer socks, which historically showed a strong spring peak followed by stabilization in early summer, and now a clear late-summer tapering. The demand in recent periods (P25-P30) has averaged 59.3 units, significantly lower than the post-peak average of ~77. The most recent demand (P30: 56) supports this downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' message (ordered P26, arrived P30). Inventory levels are currently healthy with 120 units on-hand and 142 units in-transit. Given the late-summer tapering, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the last 6 periods of lower demand (N=6) to prevent overstocking as we move further into September, while maintaining a standard 'calculate' method for lead time as 'conclude' messages show it is holding steady at 4.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand tapering confirmed: Mean demand from Period 25 to Period 30 has stabilized at 59.3 units, representing a sustained ~23% drop from the mid-summer average of 77 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860024 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a late-summer/early-autumn demand regime. As noted in the carry-over insights, demand has shifted down from the spring/summer peak (~77-89 units) to a more stable late-season level. For the most recent 7 periods (P25-P31), the average demand is 59.7 units (63, 51, 64, 53, 69, 56, 62). There is no strong evidence of a further drop yet, so a recent_N strategy with N=7 is appropriate to capture this stabilized lower demand. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31. Inventory levels are currently healthy with 66 units on hand and 195 in-transit. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock for this current demand level without over-ordering during the seasonal taper.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product, fine-knit trainer socks, has transitioned from its peak spring/summer demand (averaging ~89 units in P7-P12) to a late-summer tapering phase. For the last 8 periods (P25-P32), demand has averaged 59.5 units, significantly lower than the mid-summer average of 77 units. This represents a sustained regime shift as identified in previous carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the exception of Period 20's shipment which appears lost (ordered P16, arrived P20 was 0; however, subsequent orders from P17 onwards arrived on a 4-period lead time). The current on-hand inventory is 44 units with 226 units in transit. Given the tapering demand, I am using a recent window of N=8 to capture the current late-season mean (59.5) and variance, ensuring the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters reflect the lower requirements of the current regime to avoid overstocking while maintaining a 4-period lead time buffer.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860024' (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a late-season transition. Period 33 showed a demand spike to 90 units, contrasting with the late-summer average of ~59 units observed in Periods 25-30. This spike suggests a potential 'back-to-school' or late-season clearance bump before autumn. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are relying on the pipeline (245 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to maintain sufficient stock for this localized volatility while respecting the general downward trend since the spring peak. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the recent tapering trend while acknowledging the latest spike (avg ~64), and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: A localized demand spike (90 units) occurred during late September, potentially linked to back-to-school or promotional activity, interrupting the previous late-summer tapering trend of 59 units/period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860024 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a transitional demand phase. Historically, demand hovered around 59 units (P25-P30) but shifted higher in late September/early October. Period 33 saw a spike to 90 units, and Period 34 demand was 69 units. The average for the last 3 periods (P32-P34) is 70.7 units, indicating an upward shift from the summer low, likely due to autumn/back-to-school seasonality. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P34 arrival of the P30 order. Current inventory is low (4 units on-hand) with 256 units in-transit. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent upward trend from the late summer baseline without overreacting solely to the Period 33 spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen in the recent spike. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the higher 70+ unit demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 33: Average demand increased from 59 units (late summer tapering) to approximately 71 units (P32-P34 average), likely reflecting autumn seasonality for socks.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. We are entering the autumn season for this trainer sock SKU. While Period 33 saw a significant demand spike (90 units), demand in the subsequent two periods has averaged 61 units (69 and 53). The 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 35 suggested a shift to 71 units, but recent data suggests a more moderate stabilization. Based on the history, autumn seasonality for socks usually maintains a higher baseline than late summer but is less volatile than the spring peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 12 units on-hand and a need to cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the blend of the late September spike and the recent October data, providing a balanced forecast for the next 5 weeks. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to account for the increased volatility seen in the last two months compared to the very stable late summer.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for trainer socks has shown a slight autumn shift but has moderated in the last few periods (P34-P36 demand: 69, 53, 52). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P33-P36) is 66 units, which is higher than the late-summer trough but lower than the spring peak. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 22), but a large pipeline (289 units) is in transit. Actual lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P32 order arrived P36). I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the current autumn stabilization around 66 units/period, and recent_N of 4 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains at the default promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: Mean demand for Periods 33-36 is 66 units, confirming a moderate shift from the late-summer average of 59 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for trainer socks has stabilized following a mild autumn shift. Over the last 4 periods (P34-P37), demand has been {69, 53, 52, 50}, averaging 56 units. This is slightly lower than the P33-P36 average of 66, suggesting the initial autumn spike (90 units in P33) was a localized event rather than a sustained step-change to a higher level. I will use the last 5 samples (P33-P37) to calculate mu_hat, which includes the spike as a volatility buffer but reflects the recent stabilization around 55-60 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods despite the P16-P20 gap (where P16's order was 0 and P20's order arrived but was 0, or P16 order was missing). All recent shipments (P27-P33) have arrived exactly on a 4-period lead time. Parameters are set to ensure sufficient coverage for the (L+1) period horizon while accounting for the current on-hand of 21 and the pipeline of 325 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860024 (trainer socks) is currently in an autumn demand phase. Following a localized spike in September (Period 33), demand has stabilized. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 55 units, which is slightly lower than the 'autumn stabilization' estimate of 66 units noted in P37. Given the late-year date (Nov 4), we expect demand to remain relatively steady or begin a winter transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 54 and 272 units in-transit, the pipeline is well-stocked for the 5-period window (L+1). To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 (covering P33-P38) to capture the current post-spike stabilization level while accounting for the recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization confirmed: Mean demand from Period 34 to Period 38 is 55.0 units, showing a return to levels similar to the late-summer period after the late-September peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860024 (trainer socks) is entering mid-November. Historically, trainer socks exhibit significant seasonality, with high demand in spring and summer and tapering in autumn. Recent demand (Period 39) showed a sharp drop to 22 units, which is significantly lower than the preceding 5-period average (P34-P38) of 55 units. While a single low data point is not yet a confirmed regime shift, it suggests a potential late-autumn slowdown. Currently, on-hand (123) and in-transit (218) inventories are substantial relative to recent demand levels. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (consistently observed across the last several arrivals). To avoid overstocking during a potential seasonal decline while maintaining a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the autumn average (~50 units/week) while remaining responsive to the recent low sample. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Potential late-autumn demand deceleration: Period 39 demand (22 units) is 60% lower than the P34-P38 average (55.0 units), suggesting a transition out of the autumn peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for fine-knit trainer socks has shown a significant deceleration over the last two periods (P39: 22, P40: 23), compared to the previous autumn stabilization mean of 55 units. This suggests we have exited the autumn peak and entered a lower demand regime typical for low-cut 'trainer' socks as winter approaches. On-hand inventory is healthy at 165 units, with another 153 units in-transit (P37: 85, P38: 31, P39: 37, P40: 0), ensuring we are well-covered for the current (L+1) window. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the abrupt drop, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to quickly capture the new, lower average (approx 32 units/period, down from 55), while maintaining a slightly higher N for sigma to account for the transition volatility. The OR backend will see the high inventory vs. the new lower demand forecast and likely pause ordering, which is appropriate for minimizing holding costs as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand deceleration confirmed for trainer socks: Mean demand from Period 38 to Period 40 is 32.0 units, a ~42% drop from the mid-autumn average of 55 units, indicating year-end seasonal tapering.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a clear year-end tapering phase for fine-knit trainer socks. Demand has significantly decelerated over the last three periods (22, 23, 25 units), far below the previous autumn average of ~55. The mean demand for the last 3 periods is 23.3 units. With on-hand inventory at 225 units and 68 units in-transit (due to arrive in Period 42), the total pipeline of 293 units is extremely high relative to current demand. Based on a 5-period horizon (L+1), we only expect to need ~117 units (23.3 * 5). Therefore, I am setting parameters to stop ordering and allow inventory to bleed down. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the localized low-demand regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860024' (fine-knit trainer socks) is experiencing a significant year-end demand deceleration. The most recent demand samples are 22, 23, 25, and 45, following a mid-autumn average of approximately 55-66 units. This drop is consistent with trainer socks being less popular during the winter months. Current on-hand inventory is high at 211 units, which is more than enough to cover projected demand for the remaining 5 periods of the simulation (211 units / ~30 units per period average \u2248 7 periods of stock), especially considering the declining trend. The OR backend will likely recommend zero orders given the high current stock relative to the new demand regime. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this deceleration (Avg demand P38-P42 is ~32 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9th), approaching the final periods of the game (total 47). Current on-hand inventory is 220 units with zero in-transit. A significant demand deceleration was confirmed in Period 41, with demand for these trainer socks tapering off as winter sets in. Over the last five periods (P39-P43), demand has been 22, 23, 25, 45, and 28, averaging 28.6 units per week. With only 3 full decision periods remaining and 220 units on hand, the current stock covers approximately 7.7 weeks of demand at the current rate\u2014this is well beyond the promised lead time of 4 periods and the remaining game duration. Consequently, the optimal strategy for the OR backend is to stop ordering to avoid excessive holding costs on ending inventory. I will set mu_hat to a 'recent_N' of 5 to reflect the current low-demand regime (~28.6 units/week), which, when combined with the 220 units already on hand, will correctly result in zero new orders being placed while maintaining a high service level for the remaining demand.

Carry-over insight: Year-end demand regime established: Mean demand for Periods 39-43 is 28.6 units, confirming a permanent seasonal taper for trainer socks from the autumn average of 55 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in a year-end seasonal tapering phase for trainer socks, with demand significantly lower than the autumn peak. Since Period 39, weekly demand has averaged approximately 29.3 units (22, 23, 25, 45, 28, 33). On-hand inventory is currently high at 187 units with no units in transit. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and a projected demand of ~30 units per week, the current stock (187 units) covers more than 6 periods of supply (187 / 30 \u2248 6.2). To avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a service level for the remaining 3 periods of the game, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 samples (N=6) to capture this low-demand regime (P39-P44). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. No new orders are likely to be triggered due to high existing stock relative to the expected demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/23. The product is trainer socks, which typically see a significant drop in demand during the winter months (as reflected in the late-autumn tapering insight). However, Period 45 showed a sharp, localized demand spike (81 units), likely due to holiday shopping/Christmas week. Despite this spike, trainer socks are fundamentally out-of-season. Inventory is currently high (106 on-hand) relative to the year-end average demand (approx. 29 units). No orders are in transit. Given the high on-hand stock and the expected post-holiday demand drop-off in January, I will maintain a conservative ordering stance to avoid excessive holding costs. For parameters, I'm using a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture the low winter baseline while including the holiday spike for safety, and recent_N of 7 for sigma_hat to reflect the current increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: A holiday demand spike occurred in P45 (81 units), interrupting the year-end tapering trend (avg ~29 units). This is likely a short-term festive seasonal effect before returning to winter lows.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1234.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30, 2019). The demand history shows a late-year taper (avg ~29 units/period) interrupted by a holiday spike in Period 45 (81 units) and Period 46 (67 units). These spikes are likely temporary festive season effects for 'fine-knit trainer socks'. As we enter January, demand typically returns to baseline winter lows. However, the last two periods (45 and 46) significantly elevated the recent mean. Acknowledging that the holiday peak is likely ending, I will use a balanced lookback (N=5) to capture both the recent spike and the underlying lower trend to avoid over-ordering as seasonality cools. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P43 arrived on P39 order). Pipeline inventory is 72, and on-hand is 39, which is sufficient for current low-to-moderate demand while the next order arrives.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike observed in P45-P46 (avg 74 units) following a low winter regime (avg ~29 units); expected to return to lower levels in January.
