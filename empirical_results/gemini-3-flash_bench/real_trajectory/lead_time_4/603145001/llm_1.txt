  "rationale": "Step-by-step reasoning: (a) Product: 'Angela hipster' (Basic Underwear) for the 'Divided Basics' line. This is a low-volatility staple item, but demand appears relatively high based on history. (b) Demand Analysis: Historical data shows a range of 14 to 85 units, with an average of approximately 54 units over the last 5 weeks (59, 14, 28, 85, 85). There is no strong seasonal trigger for Feb 11, though Valentine's Day (Feb 14) might contribute to the recent higher volume (85 units). (c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. With a decision at Period 1, arrival is expected during Period 5 (visible at Period 6). I need to cover demand for Periods 1 through 5 (L+1 = 5 periods). (d) Inventory: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. (e) Order Logic: Average demand is ~54. Covering 5 periods at an average of 54 requires 270 units. Given the recent spike to 85, I will buffer slightly for a higher mean (approx 65-70) to avoid stockouts during the long lead time wait. I will order 350 units to establish a pipeline and safety stock.",

Historical demand (Jan/Feb) showed a range of 14-85, but current game history (Periods 1-3) shows a significant increase in demand to ~104 units/period (91, 110, 111).

The P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 (Resolution Phase) and become visible at the start of P6.

  "rationale": "The product is a basic cotton hipster brief (Divided Basics), which typically sees steady year-round demand but can experience fluctuations during seasonal transitions and promotional periods. We are currently at Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), entering the peak holiday shopping season. Historical demand shows a significant decline from the May peak (132 units) to a late-summer/autumn low (averaging ~20-25 units in August/September). Recent demand in November has been even softer, averaging ~14 units over the last four periods (P39-P42). However, December calendar events (holidays) often trigger a retail demand spike. The 120 units ordered in P38 arrived in P42, bringing on-hand inventory to 137. An additional 120 units (ordered P39) are expected to arrive in P43 (visible in P44), as lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. This creates a total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) of 257 units. Given the recent soft demand (avg ~14), even with a 3x holiday spike to ~45-50 units/week, 257 units covers over 5 periods of supply. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P43-P47) and a high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4), the current stock is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Ordering more would likely lead to excess terminal inventory and net losses from holding costs.",

The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning any order placed now would arrive in Period 48, which is after the game concludes. Current inventory stands at 248 units. Demand has been significantly low and stable through November and early December, with the most recent weekly demands being 11, 21, and 9 units. Given the remaining 4 periods of demand (Period 44 through Period 47) and an estimated upper-end demand of 25 units per week, the total expected demand is approximately 100 units. Since on-hand inventory (248) comfortably exceeds the maximum expected remaining demand and any new orders will arrive too late to be sold, no further orders should be placed to avoid unnecessary holding costs.",

Historically, demand for this item has been very low during the late autumn and early winter months (November-December), with the most recent 5-period average (P40-P44) at approximately 12.2 units per week. Specifically, the last two weeks (December) saw demands of 9 and 7 units. Given the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) would only arrive in Period 49, which is after the simulation concludes (Period 47).

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a basic cotton hipster brief. Historically, we have observed significant demand volatility, with a major peak in May (~132 units/period) and a sustained low during autumn (averaging ~13 units). Period 45 (Dec 16) saw a sharp spike to 76 units, which is consistent with the pre-holiday shopping period (late December). At Period 46 (Dec 23), we are currently in the peak of the Christmas/Holiday season. Given that on-hand inventory is 165 units and there are no units in-transit, we must evaluate if this coverage is sufficient. The current regime appears to be a holiday spike (reaching ~76 units). Even if demand stays at this elevated level for the next 5 periods (lead time 4 + 1 decision period), the current inventory of 165 units covers approximately 33 units per period (165/5). If demand holds at the Period 45 level of 76, we would exhaust stock in roughly 2 periods. However, typically holiday demand for basics drops significantly immediately after December 25th into January. Looking at the pre-game historical data from Jan/Feb 2019, demand was around 59 and 14 units respectively. Therefore, while we are in a spike, 165 units is likely sufficient to bridge the end of the holiday peak and the transition into the slower January regime without incurring excessive holding costs ($1/unit). No further order is placed.",

  "rationale": "The SKU 603145001 (Angela hipster briefs) is currently in a seasonal peak associated with the Christmas and New Year period (dates 2019/12/23 and 2019/12/30). A significant demand spike was observed in P45 (76 units) and P46 (97 units), compared to the previous low-regime average of ~13 units. This seasonality typically mirrors the high demand seen in early 2019 (P1-P3 demand averaged ~104 units). Current on-hand inventory is 68 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, I must cover demand for the current period (P47) plus the 4-period lead time window (P48-P51). Based on the 2019 early-year history (P1-P3 demand: 91, 110, 111), I expect demand to remain high (~100 units/period) for the next few weeks as holiday spending concludes and early-year basics are replenished. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand phase (Total need \u2248 5 periods * 100 units = 500 units), and considering I currently only have 68 units, a substantial order is required. I will order 450 units to replenish the pipeline and meet this seasonal peak.",
