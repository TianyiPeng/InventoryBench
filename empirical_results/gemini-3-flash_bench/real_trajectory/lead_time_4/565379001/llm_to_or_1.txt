Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 565379001, a basic women's vest top. Current on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have no historical observation data yet, I will use the 5 provided historical demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) to establish a baseline. The mean of these samples is 298.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 23.3. For the first period, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This will rely on the backend to use the promised lead time of 4 and the full historical sample set to calculate the base stock. The (1+L) factor in the backend's logic will correctly cover the 5-period risk horizon (current period + 4 lead periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The item is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted vest top. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 269, 299, 301, 333, 292 (Mean \u2248 298.8, Std Dev \u2248 23.8). Period 1 demand was 273, which is consistent with this range. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because the first order (337 units) was placed in Period 1 and is in transit. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we expect this order to arrive in Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (5 historical samples + Period 1) to capture the stable demand mean and variance. This will set the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, balancing the high profit ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. In Period 1 and 2, we had zero on-hand inventory but significant demand (273 and 506), resulting in 779 lost sales. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted vest top, which typically sees steady demand with potential spikes as weather warms or during replenishment cycles. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) averaged ~300. However, the last recorded demand in Period 2 was 506, a significant increase that may indicate a shift or seasonality. Total in-transit is 670 units (337 from P1, 333 from P2). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, these are not expected until Period 5 (arriving at the end of P5, visible in P6 start). Because we have zero on-hand and high demand, the OR engine needs to authorize enough stock to cover the replenishment cycle (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend (333, 292, 506) and provide a higher base stock to recover from the stockout. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a staple women's tank top. Historically, demand has averaged around 300 units/week. In Period 2, we saw a spike to 506, which might be an outlier or early seasonal interest. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 1240 in-transit) are expected to start arriving in Period 5, 6, and 7 respectively, per the 'L+1' observation rule. Since no orders have reached their promised delivery window yet, we maintain the default lead time. For demand, the last 4 observations (including the 565379001 demand in game history: 273, 506, 329, plus the 5 samples provided in the prompt) suggest a mean around 330. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the most relevant recent demand patterns for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a women's tank top (basic jersey), which typically sees stable or slightly increasing demand as spring approaches in March. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 269, 299, 301, 333, 292. Recent demand during the last 4 game periods (P1-P4) showed a significant spike in P2 (506), though P3 and P4 stabilized around 329 and 298. The mean of the 5 pre-game samples is ~299. Including the game periods, the mean is ~355. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase (since L=4, P1+4=P5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units ordered (1739) are in-transit. Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, we adhere to the promised lead time L=4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=9, including pre-game samples) to capture the trend while smoothing the P2 spike. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N to account for the increased volatility seen in the game history.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's fitted vest top, a basic garment. Historical demand samples (before P1) averaged ~299. Observed demand from P1-P5 is 273, 506, 329, 298, and 275. The spike in P2 (Feb 18) stands out, but generally, demand is stable around 300-330. In Period 5, the first order (from P1) arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods (ordered P1, arrived P5). Current on-hand is 62, with 1540 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Since actual lead time matches promised (4), we expect the P2 order to arrive in P6. The pipeline is full, and our current task is to maintain the base stock level. I will use the recent 5 periods (P1-P5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand outlier (P2) while reflecting the latest trend. Choosing L=4 as 'default' since it's confirmed.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is a women's tank top. Historical demand shows a spike in Period 2 (506 units), potentially due to a Valentine's Day or early spring promotion, followed by stabilization around 300 units (mean of Periods 3-6 is approx 299). Current on-hand is 102 units with 1645 units in transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Pipeline inventory is high (1645 units) relative to recent demand (avg ~300), but the OR engine's capping logic will regulate the order. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the stable post-spike demand regime (ignoring the P2 outlier) and 'default' for sigma to ensure enough safety stock given the P2 volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6). Demand regime stabilized near 300 units/period following a one-time spike in Period 2.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). Observed demand has stabilized around ~306 units per period (excluding the Period 2 spike of 506). Recent demand samples (P4-P7) are 298, 275, 293, and 340. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). With L=4, we need coverage for 5 periods (L+1). Current inventory position: On-hand (332) + In-transit (1075) = 1407. Expected arrivals next period (P8) are 499 units (from P4). The OR backend's target base stock for 5 periods at ~305 units/period would be roughly 1525 units plus safety stock. Since the demand is entering the spring season for a 'fitted vest top', I expect steady to slightly increasing demand. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (averaging P3-P7) to capture the current stable regime and 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period lead time is now consistently demonstrated.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the SKU (Womens Everyday Basics tank top) continues to show stable demand and reliable lead times. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods based on the last four arrivals (P1-P4). Demand has averaged 311 units over the last 5 periods (P4-P8), excluding the outlier spike in P2. With current on-hand inventory at 506 and in-transit at 803 (covering P5, P6, and P8 orders), our total pipeline is 1309. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (4+1)=5 periods. 5 periods * ~310 units = 1550 units. Therefore, the OR engine should place an order for approximately 250 units. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable post-spike regime, and use the default lead time of 4.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/04/22), the product 'Moa tank' remains within a steady demand regime. Historical demand since Period 3 has averaged approximately 283 units per period (329, 298, 275, 293, 340, 325, 209, 234). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods by every concluding shipment (P1-P6). The current on-hand inventory is 639 units, with 919 units in-transit (orders from P7-P10, though P7 was 0). Total pipeline inventory is 1558 units. At an average demand of 283-300 units, this covers roughly 5+ periods of demand. The OR backend uses L=4, meaning mu_hat and sigma_hat should cover (1+L)=5 periods. Demand in the most recent two periods (P9: 209, P10: 234) has trended lower than the previous average of ~310. I will adopt a recent_N strategy for N=8 to capture the regime since the P2 spike settled, ensuring the model reacts to the recent slight decline while maintaining a buffer for the expected 300-unit mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime settled into a lower range (avg ~222) over the last two periods (P9-P10) compared to the previous P3-P8 average of ~310, possibly indicating a post-early-spring dip or shift in basic-wear purchasing.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), the SKU (Womens Everyday Basics vest top) is experiencing a sustained downward shift in demand. The mean demand for the last three periods (P9-P11) is approximately 224 units, compared to the earlier average of ~310. This likely represents a stabilization into a late-spring baseline after an early-season peak. Despite a 'promised' lead time of 4, Period 11 saw zero arrivals even though an order was placed in Period 7; however, looking at history, Period 7 had an order of 0 units. Therefore, the lack of arrival in P11 is consistent with the P7 order quantity. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on all previously concluded orders. We currently have 409 units on-hand and 972 in-transit (P8-P11 orders). Total pipeline + on-hand is 1381 units. With a 4-period lead time, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current rate of ~224 units/period, required stock is ~1120 units. Since 1381 > 1120, we are currently overstocked. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower demand regime (avg ~224 * 5 = 1120), allowing the OR engine to pause ordering until the inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 9-11 average demand is 224 units, a ~28% decrease from the P3-P8 average of ~310. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a basic fitted vest top (everyday basic). Previous insights confirmed a demand regime shift starting around Period 9 (early April), with demand dropping from ~310 to ~220 units. Historical demand for the last four periods (P9-P12) has been consistent: 209, 234, 230, and 203, yielding an average of 219 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P8 order arrived in P12). Given the stability of this new lower demand regime over 4 periods, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align inventory levels with the current run-rate of approximately 220 units per period, while maintaining the L=4 lead time setting. On-hand plus pipeline inventory is currently 1178 units, which is roughly 5.3 periods of supply at the current demand rate.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/05/13). The SKU is a 'Moa tank' (Womens Everyday Basics), which typically sees stable demand but has recently shown a significant downward trend. Demand in the last five periods (P9-P13) has averaged 182.8 units, compared to the previously established regime of ~224 units (P9-P11) and the earlier ~310 units (P3-P8). The most recent demand (P13) was only 138 units, possibly due to a mid-spring lull or market saturation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P8 order arrived P12; P9 order arrived P13). On-hand inventory is high (613 units) and we have 427 units in-transit (P10: 374, P11: 53). Given (L+1) = 5, and an estimated demand rate of ~180-200 units, our pipeline inventory (~1040 units) is sufficient for roughly 5+ periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this cooling trend and adjust the OR backend's target downward to avoid excessive holding costs. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift continued: Period 9-13 average demand has fallen to ~183 units, down from the P9-11 average of 224 and the P3-P8 average of ~310. This indicates a sustained cooling of interest in this basic item as late spring progresses.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), the 'Moa tank' (Womens Everyday Basics) is experiencing a sustained low-demand regime compared to early spring. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) is approximately 202.6 units, significantly lower than the ~310 observed in P3-P8. Historical samples from early 2019 also show demand around 300, but the current late-spring trend is cooler (~183 units in P9-P13). On-hand inventory is healthy at 785 units, and lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level, but we must use a recent demand window to avoid over-ordering based on obsolete high-demand data. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=6 captures the current lower demand level while maintaining sufficient stock for potential weekly fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at lower levels: Periods 9-14 average demand is 203 units (-35% from the P3-P8 average of 310).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted vest top. We have seen a sustained decrease in demand over the last 7 periods (P9-P15), with an average demand of approximately 199.5 units, compared to the earlier average (P3-P8) of ~310 units. This suggests the initial spring surge has passed, and we are entering a lower-demand seasonal phase for this basic item. The actual lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across almost all observed shipments (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P8, P9, P10, P11). Currently, we have 657 units on hand and 303 in-transit (orders from P14 and P15), totaling 960 units of pipeline inventory. Given the forecasted demand of ~200 units per period and a (L+1)=5 period coverage requirement, we need approximately 1000 units in the pipeline. Our current pipeline (960) is near this target. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this lower demand regime (approx 200 * 5 = 1000) and use 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period lead time is extremely stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower levels (~200 units/period) for the last 7 periods (P9-P15), down from ~310 units in P3-P8.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a 'Moa tank', a basic summer staple. Looking at the demand history, there was a clear regime shift starting around Period 9 (April); the previous average (P3-P8) was ~310 units, while the recent average (P9-P16) is ~185 units. The most recent demand (P16) was 138, and P13 was also 138, suggesting a potential further softening as summer starts, or simply high variance around a lower mean. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated by multiple arrivals). Period 7 order (53 units) arrived in P15, and P12/P13 had zero orders. The order from Period 14 (116 units) is expected to arrive in Period 18. Current on-hand is 519 and in-transit is 461. To capture the current lower demand regime and ensure the OR engine does not over-order based on the high early-season mean, I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the identified lower-demand period from P9 to P16. L is set to 'calculate' to lean on the observed 4-period lead time history.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics tank) continues to show a downward demand trend as we move into summer. The last three periods (P15-P17) recorded demands of 181, 138, and 124, respectively, indicating a further softening from the previous ~200 units/period regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 157 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent decline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical conclusions, and pipeline inventory is healthy at 578 units. The sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to account for the current lower volatility at this reduced demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: average demand declined from ~200 to ~157 units/period over the last 5 periods (P13-P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (summer). The product is a fitted tank top (Everyday Basics), which should have stable demand, but history shows a consistent decline. Demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) has averaged 147 units (202, 181, 138, 124, 92), significantly lower than the ~200 average seen in the prior regime. The most recent demand (92) suggests the decline is ongoing or stabilizing at a new lower trough. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P14 order in P18. On-hand (419) plus In-transit (462) equals 881 units. With current demand trends (~147/week), 881 units covers roughly 6 weeks of inventory, which is slightly above the target pipeline of (L+1)=5 weeks. However, since demand is trending down, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the downward shift in both mu and sigma, preventing excessive overstocking as we enter mid-summer. Lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift continued at Period 19: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P14-P18) has dropped to ~147 units, down from the previous ~200 unit average.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a seasonal basic (tank top) in late June. Demand has consistently declined and stabilized at a much lower level than the spring peak. For the last 6 periods (P14-P19), demand has averaged approximately 143 units (202, 181, 138, 124, 92, 122). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P18 and P19). Currently, on-hand inventory (484) plus in-transit stock (294) totals 778 units. Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At a mean demand of ~143 units, required base stock is around 715 units. Since 778 > 715, the system is currently overstocked. I will set mu_hat to the average of the last 6 periods to reflect the sustained lower demand regime, and L to 4 to match the proven lead time performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new lower level: Average demand for the last 6 periods (P14-P19) is ~143 units, a significant decrease from the ~200 unit average observed in P9-P14.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted vest top. Demand has consistently declined and stabilized at a lower level since early May. Over the last 7 periods (P14-P20), the average demand is approximately 139 units (202, 181, 138, 124, 92, 122, 114). The most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) show even lower demand averaging ~109 units. I will use N=7 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime while smoothing recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 528 and 225 in-transit (Total = 753), and a requirement to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand (~139 * 5 = 695), the system is currently overstocked. I will use recent_N to reflect the reduced demand and prevent further excess inventory accumulation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new lower level: Average demand for the last 7 periods (P14-P20) is ~139 units, down from the ~200 unit average observed in P9-P14.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Tank) has shown a sustained decline in demand as the summer season progresses. Demand over the last 8 periods (P14-P21) has averaged 132.75 units, significantly lower than earlier periods. Specifically, the last four periods (P18-P21) have averaged only 104 units, with the most recent demand being 89. This suggests a deepening downward trend or a new low-demand regime for the height of summer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently very high (556 units) relative to demand, covering approximately 5-6 weeks of stock. With an additional 194 units in-transit (orders from P19-P21), the pipeline is well-supplied. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend does not over-order while we burn through existing excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new low: average demand for the last 8 periods (P14-P21) is ~133 units. The most recent 4 periods (P18-P21) show a further dip to ~104 units/period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 565379001 (Moa tank) is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' item. Analyzing the historical demand until Period 22 (July 8, 2019), it is clear that demand has experienced a strong downward trend from a spring peak (P3-P8 average ~310) to a summer low. The most recent demand samples from Period 18 to 22 (92, 122, 114, 89, 74) yield an average of 98.2 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 482 units and in-transit at 256 units (738 units total), the current pipeline significantly exceeds the likely demand over the (L+1)=5 period lead time window (approx 500 units). I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the most recent stabilized low-demand regime, and calculating sigma_hat similarly to reflect current volatility. This configuration will naturally trigger the OR backend to minimize orders given the existing overstock relative to summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for summer (July) has stabilized at a significantly lower level than spring; Period 18-22 average is 98 units, compared to the P14-P17 average of ~160 and the P9-P14 average of ~200.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' tank top. We are currently in late July (Period 24, 2019/7/22). Demand has shown a significant and consistent downward trend as the summer season progresses. Recent demand points (Periods 21-23) are 89, 74, and 53, with a mean of ~72 units/period. The Carry-Over Insight correctly notes a stabilized lower regime starting around Period 18. Specifically, the Period 18-23 average demand is 90 units. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this lower average (~90 units/period), resulting in a targeted base stock across the (1+L) window (5 periods) of ~450 units. With 448 units on-hand and 237 in-transit, the system is currently overstocked relative to current demand, so the OR backend should naturally order zero or very little. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P19 order arriving in P23.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for mid-to-late summer (July) has stabilized at a new low: Period 21-23 average is ~72 units, which is a further decline from the P18-20 average of ~109 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Moa tank' (a summer basic) has significantly declined and stabilized at a low level during the peak of summer. Over the last 4 periods (P21-P24), demand recorded was 89, 74, 53, and 64, giving a mean of 70 units per period. The on-hand inventory (473) plus in-transit (148) totals 621 units. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need coverage for 5 periods (L+1). At the current demand rate of ~70 units, the required stock is approximately 350 units. Since existing inventory (621) far exceeds this, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this lower demand regime and use calculate for lead time as the 4-period arrival remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late summer (end of July) has stabilized at approximately 70 units/period (P21-P24 average), significantly lower than the ~100 units/period observed in early July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, and demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted tank top has continued to decline significantly as summer peaks and begins to transition. The demand for the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged approximately 63 units, with the most recent observation dropping to 37 units. On-hand inventory is very high at 522 units, which is enough to cover more than 8 weeks of demand even at the 63-unit average. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory levels, there is no need to order more. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the most recent regime (N=5) and lead time to the promised level (default), allowing the OR backend to naturally suppress ordering until inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late summer (August) has reached a new floor: Period 21-25 average is ~63 units, down from the P14-P20 average of ~139 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019, which is late summer. Demand for this 'Moa tank' (Everyday Basic fitted vest top) has consistently declined throughout the summer, hitting a new low regime. The average demand for the last five periods (P22-P26) is 52.6 units, but the most recent two periods (P25-P26) show a further drop to roughly 36 units/period. The current inventory on-hand is 549 units, which covers more than 10 periods of demand at the current rate (even using the higher 5-period average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the significantly cooled demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to reflect the current low-demand stability while allowing the OR backend to realize that on-hand inventory (+0 in-transit) far exceeds the base stock requirements.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late summer (August) has stabilized at a very low level: average demand for P22-P26 is ~53 units/period, with the most recent two periods dropping to ~36 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Moa tank, a summer-oriented everyday basic, is experiencing a significant and sustained end-of-season decline in demand as August progresses. The last five periods (P23-P27) show demand of 53, 64, 37, 35, and 29 units respectively, with the most recent two weeks averaging only 32 units. Current on-hand inventory is 520 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents over 15 periods of supply\u2014well beyond the (L+1) requirement. There is no in-transit inventory, and given the excessive on-hand stock relative to the end-of-summer cooling, no replenishment is needed. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the floor of this late-season demand (avg ~43.6 per period), which will ensure the OR backend's target base stock remains far below current on-hand levels, preventing unnecessary ordering and minimizing future holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor reached for end-of-summer (late August): P25-P27 average demand is ~33.6 units/period, a ~37% drop from the P22-P24 average of ~53 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Fitted vest top', which typically sees peak demand in spring and early summer, tapering off significantly towards the end of August. Historical data confirms this: demand has steadily declined from ~310 units (P3-P8) to a recent floor of ~30 units (P26-P28). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P26-P28) is 29.3 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 496 units with 0 in-transit. This inventory level already covers nearly 17 periods of current demand (496 / 29.3 \u2248 16.9), which is far beyond the required safety stock for the lead time (L+1=5). To minimize holding costs while the product enters its off-season, I will use recent_N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect the current low demand floor and rely on existing inventory, as the OR backend will naturally zero out new orders until stock levels fall below the calculated base stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 565379001 (Women's Everyday Basics Moa Tank) is experiencing a severe end-of-season decline as we enter September. Demand has plummeted from over 300 units in early spring to just 12 units in the most recent period (P29). The current on-hand inventory of 484 units is extremely high relative to current demand levels; at the current average demand of ~20 units/period (P27-P29), this inventory would last over 24 periods, far exceeding the remaining game duration. No further orders have been placed since P22, and no units are in transit. The primary objective now is to minimize holding costs by not ordering any further units. I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat using a small recent window (N=3) to reflect this 'floor' demand level, and keep L at default, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock calculation remains far below the current on-hand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor confirmed: late August/early September demand is ~20 units/period (P27-P29 average), representing a 90% decrease from peak spring levels. Inventory levels are extremely high (over 20 weeks of supply).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Fitted vest top', which has shown a clear seasonal decline from a spring peak of ~300 units/period to current late-summer/early-autumn levels of ~16-20 units/period. The average demand over the last three periods (P28-P30) is approximately 17.3 units. On-hand inventory is 468 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents over 25 periods of supply. There is no in-transit inventory, and no orders were placed recently. Given the extreme overstock situation and the ongoing demand floor, the OR backend must be prevented from ordering any more units. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the current floor (recent_N=3) to minimize further holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the remaining low demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Current demand has stabilized at an extremely low level, averaging approximately 13.7 units over the last three periods (P29-P31). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 455 units, which, at current demand rates, represents over 30 weeks of supply. Given the high holding cost relative to current sales volume and the significant excess inventory, the priority remains to avoid any further replenishment. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods when orders were placed. I will set the lead time to default and gunakan 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stagnant demand phase. This will result in a base stock level far below current on-hand inventory, ensuring the OR backend places no new orders (order = 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand has reached a seasonal minimum for autumn, averaging ~14 units/period from P29-P31, a >95% decrease from spring peak levels.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '565379001' (Womens Everyday Basics Fitted Vest Top) is in a deep seasonal trough as of late September (Period 33). Demand has effectively collapsed from its spring peak of ~300 units/period to a consistent average of ~14 units over the last 4 periods (P29-P32). The on-hand inventory of 449 units represents approximately 32 weeks of supply at the current demand rate, which is far in excess of needs. No further orders are required. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical data, though there are no pending in-transit shipments to track. Parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand regime and high inventory position to prevent any automated ordering by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a seasonal floor in September: P29-P32 average demand is ~11.8 units/period, down from ~20 units in late August and ~300 units in early spring. Inventory remains extremely high relative to current demand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Fitted vest top) has dropped significantly from its spring peak of ~300 units/period to a seasonal floor of approximately 11-12 units/period in late September. With on-hand inventory at 437 units and no pending in-transit orders, the system has approximately 36 weeks of supply based on the current demand rate. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost relative to the very low current demand, the objective is to prevent any further ordering until the excess inventory is cleared and demand recovers (likely next spring/summer). I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this seasonal low (average demand P30-P33 is 11.75). The OR backend's inventory cap and current on-hand levels will correctly result in 0 new orders.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7th, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Fitted vest top) has bottomed out during the autumn transition, showing a significant seasonal decline from its spring/summer peaks. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 11.6 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 426 units, which at the current depletion rate represents over 36 periods (weeks) of supply. With no units in-transit and a massive inventory surplus relative to the seasonal floor, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period window to accurately reflect this low-demand regime and prevent the OR backend from triggering any replacement orders. L is kept at calculate to monitor any lead time shifts, although lead time has been stable at 4 periods throughout the game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains at a seasonal floor for autumn (Oct): P30-P34 average is ~11.6 units/period, roughly 4% of initial spring demand levels. Inventory levels are extremely high (>30 weeks of supply).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. The product is a fitted vest top (Womens Everyday Basics), which has experienced a severe seasonal decline from spring peaks (~300 units) to an autumn floor (~11 units). Demand over the last five periods (P31-P35) has been 13, 6, 12, 11, and 11, averaging approximately 10.6 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 415 units, with zero units in-transit. Given the current demand rate, the on-hand inventory represents approximately 39 periods of supply. The holding cost is $1.0/unit, while the profit is $19.0/unit. To minimize excessive holding costs for a product clearly in its off-season, I am maintaining a zero-order strategy by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods of low demand. The OR backend's inventory balancing logic will naturally result in zero orders because pipeline inventory (415) far exceeds the calculated base stock level.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product is a 'fitted vest top in stretch cotton jersey', a basic summer/spring item currently in the autumn/winter off-season. Demand has plateaued at a seasonal minimum, with the last 7 periods (P30-P36) averaging ~11.3 units/period (16, 13, 6, 12, 11, 11, 10). On-hand inventory is 405 units, which represents approximately 35 weeks of supply at current demand rates. There are no orders in transit. Since the current inventory level is vastly higher than any plausible base stock level (estimated at ~60-70 units based on L=4 and mu_hat=11), the priority is strictly to avoid any new orders while slowly depleting existing stock. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the current stable low-demand regime and 'default' for other parameters. This will result in a calculated base stock far below the current on-hand level, ensuring zero units are ordered.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product is a 'fitted vest top in stretch cotton jersey', a basic summer-oriented item. Demand has reached a very low, stable floor for autumn (approximately 11 units/period). On-hand inventory is 393 units, with an additional 129 units in transit from a surprise order in Period 37. Given the current average demand of ~11 units, the total inventory (522 units) covers over 47 weeks of demand, which is far beyond the remaining 10 periods of the game. The holding cost ($1.0) is high relative to the low demand, but since inventory is already excessive, the objective is to prevent any further ordering. I will use a very small recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect the current floor (~11 units) and continue with default lead time (4 periods). The OR engine's cap will naturally prevent orders given the massive inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand for autumn (Oct) has solidified at a floor of ~11 units/period (P33-P37 average), representing a 96% drop from spring peak levels. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) now exceeds 45 weeks of supply.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Fitted vest top', which is highly seasonal, peaking in spring/summer and hitting a floor in autumn. Demand has stabilized at a seasonal minimum of approximately 11 units per period (P33-P38 average). Total inventory is 511 units (382 on-hand + 129 in-transit), which, at the current demand rate of ~11 units/period, represents over 45 weeks of supply. This far exceeds any reasonable safety stock requirement for the remaining 9 periods of the game. The order placed in Period 37 (129 units) was likely an error in previous parameters given the massive overstock. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N history of 5 periods (reflecting the current ~11 unit floor) and keep L at default (4) to ensure no further orders are triggered by the OR backend, allowing the system to naturally deplete the significant excess inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this vest top has reached a seasonal floor for autumn/winter, averaging approximately 10 units per period over the last 10 weeks (P30-P39). The inventory position is extremely high: on-hand is 376 units, and there is a recently placed order of 129 units in-transit (from Period 37, expected arrival Period 41). Total inventory (505 units) covers over 50 periods of demand at the current rate (~10 per period). There is no seasonal justification for the order placed in Period 37, and it has significantly inflated the pipeline. To stop further ordering and minimize holding costs, I am keeping L at the promised 4 periods and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current low-demand regime (~10 units). This will result in a base stock level far below the current inventory position, ensuring the OR backend places zero additional orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains at seasonal low (~10 units/period) for 10+ periods (P30-P39). Massive over-inventory persists (>50 weeks of supply).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is a 'fitted vest top', a basic jersey item that has seen a massive seasonal decline from over 300 units/period in spring to under 10 units/period in autumn. Recent demand (P38-P40) is exceptionally low (11, 6, 5). On-hand inventory is 371 units, which at the current burn rate of ~7 units/period represents over 50 weeks of supply. There are also 129 units in-transit from an order placed in P37, expected arrived around P42 (Lead Time = 4). Total inventory of 500 units far exceeds any foreseeable demand for the remaining 7 periods of the game. To maximize total reward, I must prevent any further ordering to avoid additional holding costs on inventory that won't sell before the game ends. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period regime (P31-P40) where demand averaged ~9.7 units with very low volatility. This low base stock setting, combined with the massive inventory surplus, will ensure the OR backend places zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains at seasonal low (~7 units/period) for the most recent 3 periods (P38-P40), following a steady decline since spring. Inventory levels (500 units total) are sufficient to cover current demand levels for over 70 periods, extending well beyond the game's conclusion.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). Demand for this 'fitted vest top' (a basic summer/spring item) has effectively collapsed as winter approaches, dropping to nearly zero (1 unit in Period 41). The on-hand inventory of 499 units is excessively high, covering over 70 periods of current demand at the recent average of ~7 units/period. The order placed in Period 37 arrived on schedule (L=4), further increasing on-hand stock. My objective is to minimize holding costs by preventing any further orders while the excess stock is liquidated. I will set the lead time to the promised value (4) and use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (~10 units/period). This will lead the OR engine to calculate a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand levels, ensuring zero units are ordered.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor has essentially reached zero (1 unit observed in Period 41), reflecting late-November seasonality for a vest top. On-hand inventory now provides >70 weeks of coverage.

The current date is December 2, 2019 (Period 43). This item is a 'Fitted vest top', which is seasonally inappropriate for December in the northern hemisphere. Demand has effectively flatlined, averaging only 6.3 units over the last 4 periods (P39-P42). With on-hand inventory at 486 units and average demand below 10 units per period, the current stock provides over 70 periods of coverage, which far exceeds the remaining 5 periods of the game. The objective is to maximize reward by minimizing holding costs, as further sales are unlikely to significantly deplete the massive inventory surplus. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to the minimum possible to prevent the OR engine from placing any new orders. I will use the recent 5 samples (P38-P42) to capture the current minimal demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains at a seasonal floor for early winter (Dec): P39-P42 average is 6.25 units/period. On-hand inventory now provides near-infinite coverage for the remainder of the game.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '565379001' (Womens Everyday Basics Vest Top) is in a deep seasonal trough during December. Demand has consistently been in the single digits for several periods (P39-P43 average demand is 5.4 units). With 484 units on-hand and only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P44-P47), the current inventory covers the remaining demand hundreds of times over. No additional orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect this low-demand regime to prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders, though the 'cap' mechanism and current on-hand inventory would likely prevent ordering regardless.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16th (Period 45), and the game ends at Period 47. The product is a 'Moa tank' (fitted vest top), which is a summer-seasonal item. Demand has collapsed from spring peaks of ~300 units to a negligible single-digit average in December (mean demand of last 5 periods is ~4 units). On-hand inventory is 482 units, which is enough to cover current demand for over 100 weeks, far exceeding the 3 periods remaining in the simulation. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the extreme overstock situation and the high holding cost ($1.00/unit/period) relative to the virtually non-existent demand, the priority remains to halt all ordering to minimize total holding costs. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the most recent regime to ensure the OR backend does not trigger any safety-stock-based orders.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (late December) of the 47-period game. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Fitted vest top', which is highly seasonal and currently at its annual demand trough. In Period 45, demand spiked slightly to 23 units (potentially due to pre-Christmas clearing or holiday travel), but the overall autumn/winter average remains below 10 units/period (P39-P45 average is ~7 units). With an on-hand inventory of 459 units and no units in transit, we have over 65 weeks of supply for a game that ends next period. To maximize the total reward (Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory), we must strictly avoid ordering any more units. The priority is to minimize holding costs on the existing massive overstock. I am setting L to 4 (promised), and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the recent 7-period demand regime to ensure the base stock calculation remains well below current inventory levels, preventing the OR backend from triggering any orders.
