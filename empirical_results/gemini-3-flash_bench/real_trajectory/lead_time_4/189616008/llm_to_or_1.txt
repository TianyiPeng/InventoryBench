Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Heavy jersey long leg leggings', a basic apparel item. Historical demand (5 samples) shows an average of 72.6 units per week (min 42, max 89). As there is no inventory on-hand or in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the product's basic nature and the dates provided (early February), we are moving past the post-holiday slump into a steady demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent mean of ~72.6. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=5 to reflect the observed variance in the initial data. I will set L to 'default' (4 periods) as we have no historical arrival data to suggest a deviation from the promised lead time yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The item is 'Leggings/Tights' (Divided Basics), a stable jersey basic. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows samples: 89, 42, 81, 71, 80, 63 (average ~71, std ~17). Current inventory is 0 because the first order (103 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 4. This means the order placed in P1 will arrive during P5 and be visible in P6. Consequently, we will likely experience stockouts for the next few periods (P2, P3, P4, P5). To recover and ensure we cover the risk during this lead time, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 6 samples. For L, I will use the promised lead time of 4. Since the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L) * mean, and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L) * std, these settings will target a base stock level sufficient to cover demand from the time of ordering until the shipment arrives.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Feb 25th. The SKU is 'Heavy jersey long leg leggings', a basic apparel item. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a mean of approximately 75 units/week. Recent demand in P1 (63) and P2 (93) averages 78, confirming consistency with history. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 202 units in-transit (P1 order 103, P2 order 99). Promised lead time is 4 periods, so the P1 order is expected to arrive at the start of Period 5. Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, we adhere to the promised lead time L=4. Demand appears stable, so I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent samples including P1 and P2, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility (P2 saw a spike). The target service level (q) is high (19/(19+1) = 0.95), and the OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for L+1 (5 weeks).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a staple clothing item (Jersey Leggings). We are currently in Period 4 (Early March). Historical demand samples (89, 42, 81, 71, 80) and game history demand (63, 93, 57) show a mean of approximately 72 units per week. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 are still in transit (103+99+97 = 299 units), which is consistent with a 4-period lead time; we expect the first arrival in Period 5. Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, there is no evidence to change the lead time from the default. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8, incorporating both the provided pre-game samples and the 3 periods of game history to capture the steady baseline demand. Currently, on-hand is 0 and we are losing sales, but the pipeline (299) covers roughly 4.15 weeks of demand, which aligns with the lead time. No new sustained changes are detected yet.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The SKU is 'Heavy jersey long leg leggings', a basic item with consistent demand. We are currently at Period 5. Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, the order placed in Period 1 (103 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5. However, since the conclusion of Period 5 isn't visible yet, on-hand remains 0. Current in-transit is 400 units (sum of orders from P1-P4). Historical demand samples (n=9) show: 89, 42, 81, 71, 80 (pre-game) and 63, 93, 57, 80 (in-game). The mean demand is approximately 72.9 units per period. Since there are no observed arrivals yet, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4). To capture the stable demand pattern while weighting recent observations, I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to encompass all available data points (5 pre-game + 4 in-game). This approach ensures we maintain a base stock level that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand, balancing the high profit ($19.0) against the low holding cost ($1.0).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Heavy jersey long leg leggings', a staple 'Basics' item. Current on-hand is 0, following a stockout in Period 5 where demand (114) exceeded arrival (103). The promised lead time of 4 periods was confirmed by the Period 1 order arriving in the Period 5 conclusion (4 periods). We have 322 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), with the P2 order (99 units) expected to arrive during this period (P6). Historical demand samples (including pre-game) show: 89, 42, 81, 71, 80 (pre-game) and 63, 93, 57, 80, 114 (in-game). Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 81.4 units/period, while the long-term average (10 samples) is 77 units/period. The jump to 114 in P5 might indicate a slight upward trend as we move into spring, but it's not yet a confirmed regime shift. Given the stockout and the lead time of 4 periods, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the recent slight increase while maintaining stability.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a jersey legging, a staple basics item. Historical demand samples (including pre-game and game history) show mean demand around 80 units/period (Recent 11 samples mean: 80.8). Promised lead time is 4, and confirmed arrivals for Period 1 and 2 orders also show an actual lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (30), while total in-transit is 343 (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). The OR logic uses (L+1) for the review+lead window. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 11 samples for mu_hat provides a stable baseline for this basic item. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same window to capture recent volatility (~20 per period). No major seasonal shifts are detected yet in late March for this basics category.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a staple item (Jersey Leggings) with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Observed lead times for the first three orders (placed P1, P2, P3) have all been exactly 4 periods, confirming the lead time is stable. Historical demand across the last 12 weeks (7 game periods + 5 pre-game samples) has fluctuated between 42 and 114, with a mean of approximately 76.8. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 83.3, slightly higher than the overall average. Given we are entering spring, demand for leggings may see moderate variability but no clear evidence of a major regime shift yet. Pipeline inventory (326) consists of orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7. With on-hand inventory at 60 and average demand ~77, we are at risk of a minor stockout in the current period (P8) before the P4 order arrives in P9. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the slightly elevated recent trend, and 'default' for lead time and sigma_hat to maintain safety buffers.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. The product is a basic legging ('Jersey Basic'), which generally follows stable demand patterns but may see slight upticks in spring for layering. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 1 arrived in Period 5, Period 2 in Period 6, etc.). Historical demand samples (including pre-game and game history) show a mean of approximately 76 units per period. The standard deviation across all samples is roughly 19. Recent demand in Periods 6, 7, and 8 has been 69, 67, and 67 respectively, showing a slight stabilization/moderation compared to the earlier spike in Period 5 (114 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%). I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the full game history) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime which includes the Period 5 spike, ensuring the buffer is sufficient for potential volatility while the L=4 lead time is confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (consistently observed across 4 arrivals).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019. The product is a jersey basic legging, which typically sees steady demand but can fluctuate with spring fashion transitions. Historical demand data shows the following: Jan/Feb (89, 42, 81, 71, 80, 63, 93, 57), March (80, 114, 69, 67), and early April (67, 44). The mean demand over the last 10 periods (since Period 1) is approximately 73.5 units. The actual lead time L=4 has been consistently confirmed by the last 5 arrivals (Periods 5-9). I have 75 units on hand and 332 in-transit. Given that lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of the last 10 periods (approx 73.5), the expected 5-period demand is ~368. Current inventory position is 75 (on-hand) + 332 (in-transit) = 407. The OR backend will compute the order based on mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most relevant demand regime while maintaining L at the promised lead time (4), as it is currently accurate.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a jersey legging, a basic staple. Analyzing historical demand, there was a peak in early March (Period 5 demand=114), which has since stabilized into a lower regime (averaging 42.5 over the last 4 periods). The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 10. Currently, on-hand inventory is 160 units with 245 units in-transit (covering orders from Periods 7, 8, 9, and 10), which is more than sufficient for the current demand trend. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the current lower stabilization rather than the early-March spike, while maintaining the L=4 setting to match observed performance.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a basic jersey legging, which typically sees steady demand but can fluctuate slightly with seasonal changes. Historically, demand over the last 11 periods has averaged 67.2 units, but there is a noticeable softening in the most recent 3 periods (avg 43 units) compared to the preceding 5 periods (avg 78.4 units). I am also monitoring lead times, which are consistently 4 periods as previously confirmed. With 190 units on-hand and 165 in-transit (covering orders from periods 8, 9, 10, and 11), our pipeline is currently high relative to recent demand. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent_N of 11 to capture the high and low cycles, while maintaining a standard volatility estimate (sigma_hat) using all samples to ensure the OR backend builds a sufficient safety buffer for potential demand recovery. Lead time is kept at the default/promised 4.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a jersey legging, which typically sees stable demand but may experience slight declines as weather warms in the Northern Hemisphere. Looking at the demand history since Period 9 (early April), demand has stabilized at a lower level (avg ~45) compared to the February-March period (avg ~80). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (212 units) due to arrivals from previous high-order periods (P7 and P8). The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand. Using N=4 for mu_hat captures the recent lower demand regime (avg 44.25 per period). mu_hat = (1+4) * 44.25 = 221.25. Given current inventory (212) and in-transit (153), the total stock position is 365, which is well above the projected 5-period demand. The OR backend will likely order 0 or very little, which is appropriate to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 9: Average weekly demand decreased from ~80 to ~45 (-44%).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic legging ('Divided Basics'). Current demand shows a sustained regime shift that occurred around Period 9. Pre-P9 average demand was ~81.4, while P9-P13 average demand has dropped to 42.6 (a reduction of approx 48%). The current date is May 13th, transitioning out of peak spring demand for basic heavy jersey leggings. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as previously verified. On-hand inventory is high (238 units) relative to the new demand regime (approx 5.5 weeks of supply), and there are 91 units in-transit (orders from P10 and P12). Total pipeline inventory (329) significantly exceeds the required base stock for a 5-period window (L+1) under the current regime (approx 5 * 43 = 215). To prevent excessive holding costs, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and use the default lead time (4). No ordering is expected from the backend due to high inventory levels.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/20 (Period 15). We are in a lower demand regime which started around Period 9. The average demand across these last 6 periods (Periods 9-14) is approximately 40.33 units per week, significantly lower than the initial ~80 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 242 units, which is enough to cover nearly 6 periods of demand at the current rate (242 / 40 \u2248 6.05). Additionally, there are 58 units in-transit (ordered Period 12). Since our current inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 300) far exceeds the base stock requirements for a 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods of demand), the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in an order of 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the recent demand drop accurately and minimize further overstocking and holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/27. The item is 'Leggings in extra sturdy jersey', a basic apparel item. Analysis of the demand history confirms a regime shift that occurred around Period 9. Pre-Period 9, demand averaged ~73 units/week. Since Period 9, demand has significantly stabilized at a lower level: the last 7 periods (P9-P15) show an average of 40.28 units/week (44, 35, 50, 48, 36, 29, 40). Looking at the 'conclude' messages, the lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 202 units, and the pipeline inventory is 58 units (ordered in Period 12). Period 11, 13, 14, and 15 had 0 units ordered. The inventory on-hand (202) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the lead time plus review period ((4+1) * 40 \u2248 200). Therefore, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the calculate method for L as the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. The product is 'Leggings in extra sturdy jersey', a staple basic item. Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 9 (April 2019), where weekly demand dropped from an average of ~80 to ~40 units. Recent periods (13-16) show even lower demand levels (36, 29, 40, 18), averaging ~31 units. The lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 242 units with 0 in-transit. With an expected weekly demand of approximately 35 units, the current stock covers nearly 7 periods of demand. Given the lead time (L=4) plus current period (L+1=5), we are currently overstocked. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=8) to capture the lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend does not over-order while we deplete excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand since Period 13 is approximately 31 units per week, significantly lower than the previous regime of 45.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product (leggings) is experiencing a significant and sustained demand drop. Historical demand has transitioned through three regimes: initial (~72 units/week), a middle regime (~45 units/week), and the current stabilized regime which has averaged approximately 27.8 units/week over the last 5 periods (P13-P17: 36, 29, 40, 18, 16). On-hand inventory is 226 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate and a total lead time of 4 periods (5 periods of coverage needed). Pipeline inventory is 0. With an expected weekly demand of ~28, the required base stock (L+1=5 periods) would be around 140-160 units. Since 226 > 160 and in-transit is 0, the OR backend will correctly place zero orders. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (avg 27.8) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17) is 27.8 units/week, down from the previous 45 units/week.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product (leggings) is experiencing a sustained low-demand regime as summer progresses. Since Period 13, weekly demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level (average of ~28 over the last 6 periods). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 199 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the demand forecast (approximately 28 units/week) and the total planning horizon (L+1 = 5 periods), the target stock level is around 140 units. Since 199 (on-hand) + 0 (in-transit) > 140, no new orders are necessary. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time and use 'recent_N' (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (P13-P18: 36, 29, 40, 18, 16, 27). This helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering during the seasonal dip.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand for SKU 189616008 (extra sturdy jersey leggings) has shown a significant and sustained downward trend. The initial demand (Periods 1-8) averaged ~80 units, dropped to ~45 units (Periods 9-12), and has further stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 22.8 units/week over the last 5 periods (P15-P19: 40, 18, 16, 27, 13). With on-hand inventory at 186 units and zero 'In-transit' items (as the last order was placed in Period 12 and arrived in Period 16), the stock level is extremely high relative to current demand. 186 units covers approximately 8 periods of demand at the current rate (22.8/week), which is well beyond the lead-time-plus-one-period window (5 periods). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to minimize holding costs by not ordering additional stock until the current surplus is consumed. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 samples (N=7) to capture the lower-demand regime accurately while maintaining a safety buffer in the parameters, though the OR engine will likely order zero units due to the 'pipeline_inventory' comparison.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in Period 14-19 confirmed: Average weekly demand has dropped further to ~23 units (-50% from the previous ~45 unit regime).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616008 (Leggings/Tights) continues to experience a sustained decline in demand as it transitions further into the summer season (July 1st). The carry-over insights correctly identified a series of downward regime shifts. In the most recent 7 periods (P14-P20), demand has averaged 21 units (29, 40, 18, 16, 27, 13, 15), compared to the earlier regime of ~45. Currently, on-hand inventory is 171 units with 0 in-transit. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 21 plus the 4-period lead time (5 periods total). At the current average of ~21 units/week, we need approximately 105 units to cover the pipeline. Since current on-hand (171) significantly exceeds this requirement, the OR backend will correctly order 0 units to drain the excess stock and minimize holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the low-demand summer regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (leggings) is in a low-demand summer phase, as evidenced by a consistent downward trend since Period 9. The most recent demand regime (P16-P21) shows an average of ~16.3 units/week (18, 16, 27, 13, 15, 9). Currently, we have 162 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. A lead time of 4 periods is confirmed. To calculate our target inventory level, we use the (L+1) logic. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the recent average of ~16.3, the required base stock is roughly 81.5 units. Since our current inventory (162) is double the required base stock and no shipments are in-transit, we continue to stop ordering to reduce holding costs. I am setting L to 'calculate' (4), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current low-demand regime, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' to match the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 21: July demand is extremely low, averaging ~12.3 units over the last 3 periods (P19-P21), confirming the continued drop in summer relevance for this jersey basic legging.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a 'Heavy jersey long legging', which is a thicker basic item typically showing lower demand during the peak summer months. We are in a sustained low-demand regime: the last four periods show demand of 13, 15, 9, and 15 (average ~13 units/week). Our current on-hand inventory is 147 units, which covers over 11 weeks of current demand\u2014well beyond the 5-week (L+1) coverage window required by our lead time of 4 periods. Since pipeline inventory is 0 and on-hand inventory is already far in excess of the optimal base stock, the OR backend will naturally order 0 units. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent stabilized low-demand regime (starting Period 19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for the lead time as the confirmed lead time of 4 is well-established in history.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616008 (extra sturdy leggings) is in a low-demand summer phase. Current Date is July 22, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear regime shift beginning around Period 14, where demand dropped from ~45 to below 20 units. In the most recent four periods (P20-P23), demand has been 15, 9, 15, and 24, averaging 15.75 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 123 units with no units in transit. Given the current average demand and a lead time of 4 periods, your current stock covers approximately 7-8 periods of demand. This is well above the (L+1)=5 period coverage needed. To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand state, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the contemporary demand level (approx. 16 units/week), which will result in no new orders being placed by the OR backend until the inventory level falls significantly.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stabilized in the low-summer regime; average demand for P20-P23 is 15.75 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616008 (Heavy jersey leggings) continues to exhibit a low-demand regime characteristic of the summer season (July). For the most recent 4 periods (P21-P24), demand has averaged 15.0 units/week (9, 15, 24, 12). On-hand inventory is currently 111 units with zero in-transit. Given the mean demand of ~15 units and a (L+1) horizon of 5 periods (L=4), the required pipeline stock is approximately 75 units plus a safety buffer. With 111 units on hand, we are significantly overstocked relative to the current low demand, which justifies the consecutive zero-order periods. I will continue to use a 'recent_N' approach with N=12 to capture the full stabilizing downtrend while acknowledging the persistent low demand. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/05). Historical demand for these 'extra sturdy' jersey leggings shows a clear seasonal decline throughout the summer, hitting a low period in July. Demand in the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25: 9, 15, 24, 12, 15) averages 15 units. We are now entering August/September, which typically sees a 'Back to School' increase for leggings and basic apparel. While we must maintain lean inventory due to the current high on-hand stock (96 units) relative to recent demand, we should nudge our forecast slightly up to prepare for the autumn transition. Using N=5 for demand statistics captures the current low regime while allowing the OR engine to start scaling for the upcoming season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 12, 2019. We are exiting the peak summer trough for these heavy jersey leggings. Historical demand for P21-P26 has stabilized at an average of 18 units/week (9, 15, 24, 12, 15, 33), with a noticeable uptick to 33 in the most recent period, suggesting a possible 'Back to School' or early autumn recovery. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With 63 units on-hand and 32 in-transit (due P29), we have 95 units to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). At the current mean of ~20, this is sufficient, but we should prepare for higher autumn demand. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low-demand regime while allowing the recent uptick to influence the forecast, ensuring the base stock level remains responsive to the emerging seasonal shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P26: Potential seasonal recovery (Back to School) as weekly demand rose to 33 from the summer average of 15.75.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (extra sturdy jersey leggings) is entering the mid-August 'Back to School' period. Since Period 26, demand has shown signs of recovery from the July summer slump (avg ~16) to a higher level (avg ~28.5 over P26-P27). As the weather cools and school seasons begin, demand for long leggings is expected to continue trending upward toward earlier spring levels (~45). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 39 units with 60 in-transit (ordered P25 and P27). To ensure coverage for the current period plus the 4-period lead time (Total L+1 = 5 periods), and anticipating the seasonal upturn, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the upward momentum (avg ~23.6, resulting in (1+L) * 23.6 \u2248 118). This method balances the extremely low July demand with the recent August recovery.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are seeing a sustained recovery in demand as we transition from the summer low (avg ~15 units) to the 'Back to School' season. Demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) has been 33, 24, and 30, averaging 29 units/week. This supports the 'seasonal recovery' insight noted in Period 27. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this higher demand regime for the (L+1) horizon. On-hand inventory is low (9 units), and while we have 97 units in-transit (orders from P25, P27, P28), the lead time is consistently 4 periods. The P25 order (32 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P29) and will be visible in the next conclude message. I will stick with the default lead time of 4 as it has been stable.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed seasonal recovery (Back to School) started P26: Demand increased from summer average of 15.75 to ~29 units/week (avg of P26-P28).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, which aligns with the continuous 'Back to School' seasonal recovery noted in previous periods. Demand over the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 33, 24, 30, and 37, averaging 31.0 units per week. This is a clear upward shift from the summer average of 15.75. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units). Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 102 units (from orders in P27, P28, and P29). Since demand is increasing as we enter the autumn season, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recovery while maintaining the stabilized lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Back to School recovery regime confirmed (P26-P29): Demand has increased to an average of 31 units/week from the summer average of 15.75.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P26-P30) confirms a seasonal recovery (Back to School) with demand units of 33, 24, 30, 37, and 47 respectively. This is a clear upward trend compared to the summer low of ~16 units. The most recent demand (P30) was 47, but we were stock-constrained (sold only 4). To avoid further stockouts, I am calculating mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P26-P30) where the average is 34.2 units/period. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 143 units in-transit (ordered P27, P28, P29, P30). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 captures this new post-summer regime while providing a buffer for the observed volatility. The stockout in P30 suggests we need to be aggressive in maintaining the base stock to meet this rising demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26: Seasonal recovery (Back to School) increased average weekly demand from ~16 to ~34 units (+112%).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. This SKU (Heavy Jersey Leggings) has transitioned from a low-demand summer regime (approx. 16 units/week) into a Back-to-School/Autumn recovery regime starting Period 26. Since Period 26, weekly demand values have been 33, 24, 30, 37, 47, and 56. The most recent three weeks (47, 56) show a clear upward trend as weather cools. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in stockouts in Periods 30 and 31. Total in-transit is 164 units (orders from P28, P29, P30, P31). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To address the accelerating demand and current stockout, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the recovery regime (P26-P31), which averages approximately 38 units/week. Setting L to 4 to match observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating into Autumn: Average weekly demand for P29-P31 is 46.7 units, significantly higher than the initial recovery average of 31 units, reflecting seasonal cooling.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. This product (heavy jersey leggings) has entered its peak autumn demand season. The average weekly demand for the most recent 4 periods (P29-P32) is approximately 43.75 units, reflecting a clear upward trend from the summer low (16 units) and the initial back-to-school recovery (31 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 2 units on-hand and 185 units in-transit (P29-P32 orders total 185), we are in a stock-out recovery phase. We need to set mu_hat based on the most recent autumn regime (N=4) to ensure the backend captures this higher demand level for the (L+1) period look-ahead. This avoids under-ordering as weather cools and demand for sturdy jersey leggings typically spikes.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand acceleration confirmed: Average demand for P29-P32 has risen to ~44 units/week, a +40% increase from the initial late-August recovery phase.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. This is an Autumn regime where demand for 'Heavy jsy long leg' (leggings) is accelerating as the weather cools. Recent demand shows a significant upward trend: P30 (47), P31 (56), P32 (35), P33 (71). The average of the last 4 periods (P30-P33) is 52.25 units/week. This confirms the 'Autumn demand acceleration' noted in the insights. On-hand inventory is 0 because demand (71) exceeded the sum of starting inventory (2) and arrivals (37). Pipeline inventory is 208 units, consisting of orders from P30 (41), P31 (49), P32 (58), and P33 (60). Given the lead time of 4, the P30 order (41 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution of P34. To satisfy the high Autumn demand and service level requirements (Profit $19/Holding $1), I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime, and set sigma_hat using the same window to account for increased volatility (e.g., the jump to 71 units). Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Weekly demand for P30-P33 reached an average of 52.25 units, significantly exceeding the late-August recovery average of 34 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616008 is entering Period 35 (early October). Current inventory is critical: On-hand is 0, and current demand is outpacing arrivals, leading to stockouts in P30, P31, P33, and P34. Demand analysis shows a clear seasonal acceleration: the average demand of the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 55.6, compared to the P26-P29 average of 31. This confirms the 'Autumn Peak' identified in carry-over insights. To capture this growth and recover from stockouts, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers the peak acceleration) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect increased volatility during this high-demand phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical concludes (P29, P31-P34). The OR engine needs to prioritize stock replenishment to meet this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak acceleration confirmed: Average demand for P30-P34 reached 55.6 units/week, a 79% increase over the late-August recovery average of 31.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Heavy jersey long leg leggings', which shows clear seasonality as temperatures drop. Current date is October 14. We are in a confirmed 'Autumn peak' demand regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 53.6 units/week (56, 35, 71, 69, 67). However, the last three weeks have been even higher, averaging 69 units/week. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and we have been experiencing stockouts (sold < demand in P33, P34, P35), I must set parameters to aggressively replenish. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime while recognizing the upward trend. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to reflect the higher volatility seen during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Average weekly demand for P33-P35 is 69 units, a 24% increase over the P30-P34 average of 55.6, driven by seasonal cooling.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616008 (heavy jersey leggings) is currently in a high-demand autumn regime. Recent demand has been volatile but generally trending upward compared to the summer lows. Specifically, the average demand for the last five periods (P32-P36) is approximately 54.2 units/week. While Period 36 showed a drop to 29 units, this follows three consecutive weeks of high demand (71, 69, 67), suggesting the lower figure might be an outlier or a temporary dip rather than a shift back to low demand. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 295 units in-transit and 29 on-hand, we need to maintain a base stock that covers the next 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current autumn volatility while buffering against the high average demand observed over the last month.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (Period 38), and we are in an Autumn demand regime. While previous periods showed a peak accelerating up to ~69 units/week (P33-P35), the most recent two periods (P36-P37) have seen a cooling off, with demand at 29 and 41 units (average 35). This suggests the initial peak of the cooling season has passed or stabilized. Currently, on-hand inventory is 48 and in-transit is 258 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high in-transit volume (which includes orders from the higher-demand peak), I will use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility to reflect the current stabilization. I choose N=5 (P33-P37) for mu_hat to capture the transition from peak to the current level, resulting in a mean of approximately 47.4 units/week. This approach allows the OR backend to maintain a safe base stock while accounting for the high volume already in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: After peaking at ~69 units/week in early October, demand in late October (P36-P37) has moderated to an average of 35 units/week.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616008 (heavy jersey leggings) is currently in a post-autumn peak stabilization phase as of Period 39 (early November). Demand spiked in early October (P33-P35) reaching an average of 69 units/week but has moderated significantly in the last three periods (P36-P38) to an average of 35.3 units/week (29, 41, 36). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 90 units on-hand and 222 units in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the peak), we are well-covered. To avoid overstocking as we move further into November, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture this recent stabilization at ~35 units. This will allow the OR backend to adjust the base stock downward while maintaining sufficient service levels for the (L+1) = 5 period protection window.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed post-autumn peak: Average weekly demand for P36-P38 is 35.3 units, a 49% decrease from the early October peak of 69 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The 'Jersey Basic Legging' has moved past its autumn peak observed in early October (avg ~69 units) and has stabilized into a post-peak regime. The average demand for the last four periods (P36-P39) is 36.75 units (29, 41, 36, 41). This represents a consistent stabilization compared to the previous volatile peaks. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this stable post-peak demand. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P35 order arrived at P39). With 130 units on-hand and 141 in-transit (orders from P36, P37, P38), the current inventory position is strong relative to the stabilized demand. sigma_hat is set to default as the standard deviation across recent samples is relatively low and the default method provides a safe buffer for current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak stabilization: Average demand for P36-P39 settled at 36.75 units/week, down from the early-October peak of 69 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a post-autumn peak stabilization phase for these heavy jersey leggings. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) has been: 29, 41, 36, 41, 31, averaging 35.6 units per week. This represents a significant drop from the early-October peak (average 69 units) but remains stable compared to the summer lows. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory position: On-hand is 175, and In-transit is 71 (ordered P37: 23, P38: 42, P40: 6). Total pipeline is 175+71 = 246 units. Given the lead time (L=4), we want to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~36 units/week, 5-period demand is ~180 units. Since our pipeline (246) exceeds this, the stock is currently sufficient. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (from P36-P40) to reflect this stabilized demand regime and use recent_N for sigma to capture the current volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), the demand for SKU 189616008 has stabilized post-autumn peak. Over the last 6 periods (P36-P41), demand samples are [29, 41, 36, 41, 31, 32], resulting in a consistent average of ~35 units per week. This follows a high-demand period in early October where demand peaked near 70. On-hand inventory is currently high (166 units) with 48 units still in-transit (P38 and P40 orders), which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the next (L+1) periods (approx 35 * 5 = 175 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My parameters aim to align the base stock with this stabilized demand regime to prevent unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand stabilization confirmed (P36-P41): Weekly demand has settled at an average of 35 units, a significant decrease from the early October peak of 69 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are in the post-autumn stabilization phase, although Period 42 saw a significant spike in demand to 84 units (likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales). Prior to this spike, demand had stabilized around 35 units per week (periods 36-41). Given the product is 'extra sturdy jersey' leggings, we should expect demand to remain higher than the summer lows but stable now that the initial autumn cooling surge has passed. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 124, which is sufficient for ~2.5 weeks of demand at the current high-end average, but with only 6 units in-transit, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the (L+1)=5 week lead time window. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 7 to incorporate the recent stabilization period AND the Black Friday spike, providing a balanced forecast that doesn't overreact to the single surge but respects the current seasonal level.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in Period 42 (84 units) likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Monitoring for return to the ~35 units/week stabilization level.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9). Historical demand patterns for this jersey legging SKU show a recent stabilization around 35 units/week (P36-P41), followed by a Black Friday/Cyber Monday spike in P42 (84 units) and P43 (59 units). Given the date (early December), we expect demand to remain higher than the 35-unit baseline due to holiday shopping but likely taper off from the peak weeks. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P36-P43) is 44.1 units, which balances the stabilization level with the holiday spike. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 65 units on-hand and 80 in-transit (ordered P40 and P43), our pipeline inventory is 145. To ensure coverage over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), we use a recent demand window of N=8 to capture the current holiday-influenced mean while smoothing the extreme Black Friday peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Average weekly demand for P42-P43 rose to 71.5 units, up from the post-autumn stabilization average of 35 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Demand in P42-P43 saw a clear spike (84 and 59 units) consistent with Black Friday and Cyber Monday. However, demand in P44 dropped to 28 units, suggesting a return to the post-autumn stabilization level (~35 units) or potentially a pre-Christmas lull. In-transit inventory is 149 units, with orders from P41 (potentially lost as P40 arrived in P44), P42, P43, and P44 still pending. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P40 arrived in P44). To avoid overstocking as the peak holiday window closes, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the average reflecting the recent spike (avg ~47) while balancing it against the most recent drop. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to account for high holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization: Demand dropped to 28 units in P44 after a two-week spike (avg 71.5), signaling the end of the Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we observed a massive demand spike of 342 units. Given the date (Dec 16-22) and the product description (sturdy leggings), this is likely a pre-Christmas peak or a specific promotional event for a winter essential. This spike resulted in a stockout (on-hand is now 0). Looking forward to Period 46 (Dec 23), we expect demand to remain extremely high through the Christmas holiday week. The pipeline has 236 units in transit, but none are scheduled to arrive until Period 47 (the Period 43 order of 74 units). We are currently in a stockout and cannot fulfill demand this period. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to 600, calculated as (1 + Lead Time of 4) * a forecasted weekly demand of ~120 units (balancing the 342 spike with the expected drop post-Christmas). Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for heightened volatility during the holiday/clearance transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak detected in P45: Demand spiked to 342 units (likely pre-Christmas/promotional). Expect elevated demand for P46 followed by a sharp drop-off in January.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), entering the post-holiday/early January season. History shows a massive sales spike in P45 (342 units) and P46 (210 units), likely due to pre-Christmas and holiday promotions. However, on-hand inventory is currently 0 because arrivals have not kept pace with this sudden surge. The 'In-transit' of 467 units includes several large recent orders (P43: 74, P44: 75, P45: 87, P46: 231). Based on the 4-period lead time, P43 should arrive in P47, and P44 in P48. Given the product is a 'Jersey Basic Legging,' demand typically drops significantly in January after the holiday peak. I expect demand to normalize back toward the pre-holiday stabilization level of ~35-40 units/week. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 175 (35 units/week * 5 periods) to prevent the OR backend from over-extrapolating the holiday spike into the quiet January period, while maintaining L at the stabilized lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization: Expecting January demand to return to ~35 units/week after the P45-P46 holiday spike of >200 units/week.
