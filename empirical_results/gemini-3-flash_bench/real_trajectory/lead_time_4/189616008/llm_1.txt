Historical demand from the provided samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows an average demand of approximately 72.6 units per week (min 42, max 89). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which means an order placed now (P1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at start of P6). To avoid stockouts while covering the lead-time window (L+1 = 5 periods), we must account for demand in Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Given the product is a 'Basics' item, demand is relatively stable, though February might see a slight increase as people transition towards spring/activewear. I will estimate average demand at ~75 units. Total pipeline requirement for 5 periods is 5 * 75 = 375 units. Since we have 0 current inventory or in-transit, I will order 375 units to establish the initial pipeline.",

The current on-hand inventory is 241 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to ensure local inventory covers at least 5 periods of demand (P15 to P19). Given the recent average of ~38 and the clear seasonal decline for 'heavy' garments in warmer weather, a conservative forecast of 30-35 units per week suggests a total requirement of roughly 150-175 units for the pipeline. Since current on-hand (241) significantly exceeds the projected pipeline demand and there is a $1.00 holding cost per unit, the primary objective is to deplete the existing surplus.

Crucial observation: The SKU has been stocking out since Period 27 (ending inventory 0), meaning 'demand' is truncated by available supply. True latent demand is likely approaching early-year levels (75-100 units/period). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. We currently have 0 on-hand and 380 units in transit: 30 arriving in P30 (from P26), 110 arriving in P31 (from P27), 120 in P32 (from P28), and 120 in P33 (from P29). Total pipeline (including this period's order) needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. If demand continues to accelerate towards 100 units/period, we need ~500 units in the pipeline. Current pipeline (380) is slightly low for an aggressive autumn ramp-up. I will order 100 units to maintain momentum and buffer against stockouts as the weather cools.",

{
  "rationale": "The simulation is near its end (Period 45 of 47). Current on-hand inventory is 231 units, with an additional 30 units in-transit (ordered P43, expected arrival P47). Total inventory available before the game concludes is 261 units. Recent demand has fluctuated: P42 (Black Friday week) saw 84 units, but P43 and P44 returned to lower levels of 59 and 28 respectively. The average demand over the last three periods (P42-P44) is approximately 57 units. With only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47), the total expected demand is approximately 171 units (3 * 57). The current stock of 231 units is significantly more than enough to cover this remaining demand. Placing any further orders would only increase holding costs without contributing to additional sales. Therefore, the optimal action is to order 0 units.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "In Period 45 (Dec 16), demand spiked massively to 342 units, a level unseen in the entire history (nearly 4x the previous peak). This is likely driven by peak Christmas shopping and potential final clearances for the 'Divided Basics' leggings. This spike cleared out all 231 units of on-hand inventory, resulting in a stockout. We are now at Period 46 (Dec 23). The simulation ends at Period 47. Any order placed now (lead time 4) will arrive well after the simulation ends (it would arrive in Period 51). There is only 1 period remaining (Period 47) after this decision. With 0 on-hand inventory and the only incoming shipment of 30 units (ordered in Period 43) not arriving until Period 48 (visible in P49), it is impossible to satisfy any remaining demand in Period 46 or 47. Even though demand is likely high for the holidays, no replenishment will arrive in time to be sold. Therefore, ordering more units now would only result in holding costs for units that cannot be sold before the game ends.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Massive demand spike observed in Period 45 (342 units), likely due to peak holiday shopping, leading to a complete stockout.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are now at Period 47 (Final Period). The game mechanics state that orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N+4 and are visible in Period N+5. Since Period 47 is the final decision point, any order placed now will not arrive within the simulation's timeframe. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 30 units in-transit (ordered in Period 43), but that shipment will only arrive 'during' Period 47 resolution and will not be available for the Period 47 demand. History shows a massive peak (342 units in P45, 210 units in P46) due to holiday seasonality for 'heavy jersey leggings'. However, as we cannot receive any new inventory to satisfy this final period's demand, and no further periods exist to benefit from arrivals, the optimal action is to order 0. Ordering more would only incur costs without the possibility of sales.",
