Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 717490003, a soft jersey T-shirt. Historical data shows a clear downward trend from early January (49 units) to early February (14 units). This decline suggests a post-holiday drop or a transition out of a peak sales window. Because the most recent demand (14 units) is significantly lower than the historical mean (~28.8 units), using all historical data ('default') would lead to over-ordering and high holding costs. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the recent lower-demand regime (averaging ~16 units) while ignoring the higher spikes from January. The lead time L is set to 'default' (4 weeks) as there is no historical arrival data yet to suggest a deviation from the promised lead time. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that reflects current lower demand levels, balancing the target service level against the $1/unit/period holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a basic jersey T-shirt, which typically has steady demand but can show seasonality. Looking at historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4), we saw an initial high of 49/47 units which then dropped and stabilized around 14-19 units in the last three samples. Period 1 demand was 21, which aligns with this lower 'post-January' regime. Current on-hand is 0, and there are 21 units in-transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, this order is expected around Period 5. For Period 2, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the most recent samples including Period 1's 21 units) to capture this stabilized demand level (approx 20 units/week). L is kept at default (4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise. The inventory position (0 on-hand + 21 in-transit) is low compared to the expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods (~100 units), so the OR backend will likely trigger another order to reach the base stock level.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history for this SKU shows a downward trend: 49, 47, 19, 15, 14, followed by recent demand in Period 1 (21) and Period 2 (43). The average of the last 7 samples is approximately 29.7. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders placed in Period 1 are not expected to arrive until Period 5. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 67 units in transit (21 from P1, 46 from P2). I will set L to 'default' as we haven't seen any arrivals to suggest a deviation from the promised lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the last 5 samples: 14, 15, 19, 21, 43, mean ~22.4) to capture the current demand level, which is lower than the initial historical average of ~48. This results in mu_hat \u2248 (1+4)*22.4 = 112. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). We are out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory and 109 units in transit. Demand has been increasing over the last three periods (21, 43, 79). This product is a 'Cat Tee' (Jersey Basic), and we are entering the spring season, which likely accounts for the significant demand spike observed in Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The Period 1 order (placed on 2019-02-11) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Since we have no completed arrival cycles yet, we cannot confirm any lead time drift. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the accelerating spring demand trend and using explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility shown by the jump from 43 to 79.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Cat Tee' (Jersey Basic), which is a staple item likely seeing a seasonal uptick as we move from late winter into spring (March). Historical demand shows an increase, peaking at 79 in Period 3, though we are currently out of stock. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, the first shipment (21 units) is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5. We currently have 0 on-hand and 205 in-transit (orders from P1-P4: 21+46+42+96). Demand has been volatile (14, 21, 43, 79, 39). Given the stockout and the transition into spring, I will use a conservative average of historical demand to set the base stock. I'll use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent activity (including the pre-game samples leading into the live periods). For Lead Time, I will stick to the 'default' promised 4 periods as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 starting date is 2019/3/18. For SKU 717490003 (T-shirt), on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 223 units. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 3 (79 units) followed by a return to moderate levels (39-48 units in P4-P5). Average demand over the 5 game periods is (21+43+79+39+48)/5 = 46. The first arrival (Period 1 order) arrived at Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). However, current inventory is zero because demand exceeded the initial small arrival. I expect the Period 2 order (46 units) to arrive this period (Resolution phase of P6), but it will only be visible next period. mu_hat is set using recent_N=3 to reflect the higher demand regime seen from P3-P5 (average 55.33/period), specifically targeting (1+L)*55.33 = 276.65. sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted starting Period 3: Average demand increased from ~32 to ~55 following a spike of 79 units. Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/03/25). Demand for this 'Cat Tee' (Jersey Basic) has surged significantly over the last few periods: 48 units in P5 and 122 units in P6, compared to the early average of ~32. The mean demand over the last 4 periods (P3-P6) is (79+39+48+122)/4 = 72 units. We have zero on-hand inventory and 267 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Because demand is accelerating (likely due to spring seasonality for T-shirts), I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this upward shift, and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (std dev is high due to the 122 spike). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is currently holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~32 (P1-P2) to ~72 (P3-P6) with high volatility (spike of 122 in P6). Lead time currently stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-growth demand regime for the 'Cat Tee' as we enter April. Historical demand has surged from an average of ~32 in the first two periods to 79, 39, 48, 122, and 148 in the most recent five periods (averaging 87.2). A significant stockout persists; we have sold everything that arrived (on-hand is 0) despite a large in-transit pipeline of 359 units. The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (matches promised). To capture this upward trend and prevent further lost sales during the seasonal transition into spring, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the average demand of ~87 per period (total mu_hat of ~436 over L+1). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility observed (standard deviation of ~46 per period, total sigma_hat of ~103). This aggressive positioning ensures the OR backend targets a higher base stock to clear the demand backlog as soon as the pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating: Mean demand for P3-P7 has risen to 87.2 units/period, compared to previous averages (~32). Stockouts have occurred in every period since P5 due to demand significantly exceeding arriving inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Cat Tee' has shifted into a higher regime starting from Period 3. Currently, in Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are observing a significant mismatch between arriving inventory and customer demand, leading to consistent stockouts since Period 5. The recent demand (P3-P8) shows a mean of approximately 107.3 units per period (79, 39, 48, 122, 148, 108), which is nearly triple the initial samples provided (mean ~28). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (L=4). To recover from the current stockout situation and cover the full lead time cycle (L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods of high demand (N=6). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to account for the increased volatility (Std Dev \u2248 44). This will provide the OR backend with the necessary parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the elevated demand and provides a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high level: Mean demand for P3-P8 is 107.3 units/period (+280% vs early samples). Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490003' (T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand regime characterized by extreme volatility and consistent stockouts. Over the last 7 periods (P3-P9), the average demand is ~86.2 units, but individual weeks have peaked at 148. The most recent demand (P9) was 60, following 108 in P8. We remain at zero on-hand inventory. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on multiple arrivals (P5-P9 all showing lead_time=4). To recover from the stockout state and cover the 5-period risk window (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this higher mean (~86) compared to the initial samples. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the high volatility observed during this regime (std ~42), which is necessary to set a sufficiently high base stock to prevent further lost sales during the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high and volatile: P3-P9 mean is 86.2 with a standard deviation of 42.1 (vs initial samples ~28). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490003' (Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand regime, likely driven by the spring season (April). Since Period 3, demand has shifted significantly upwards. The mean demand from Period 3 to Period 10 is approximately 84.75 units per period (compared to ~42 in the pre-launch samples). The most recent demand was 74 units, and for the first time in several periods, we have positive ending inventory (16 units) because the arrival from Period 6 (90 units) finally caught up. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P6 order arrived in P10). Given the high volatility (standard deviation ~35 since the shift) and the high stockout risk seen in previous periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 8 samples (Period 3 onwards) to capture this new sustained regime while ignoring the low pre-period samples. L will remain at the promised 4 periods as it has proven stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand from Period 3 to Period 10 is 84.75 units, significantly higher than initial estimates. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490003 (Jersey T-shirt) has settled into a higher-demand regime since Period 3. Moving into late April/early May, the demand remains robust. Analyzing demand from Period 3 through Period 11, the mean is approximately 86.8 units per period, with significant volatility (std dev ~35.5). The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 46, and in-transit inventory is 346. Since the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (P3-P11) to capture the current demand regime and volatility, while keeping L at the promised 4 periods which matches historical performance.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490003' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is exhibiting a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 3. Recent demand observations (Period 11: 104, Period 12: 160) confirm that the mean demand remains significantly higher than initial samples. The average demand from Period 3 to Period 12 is approximately 94.2 units per period, with a notably high spike in the most recent period. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P5 through P12). Current on-hand inventory is 51 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 292 units (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12). Given the recent surge to 160 units, I will shift to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this established higher-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness to the high volatility seen in P12. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased mean and the significant variance observed in this category (T-shirt) during the spring season (May).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Period 3 to Period 12 mean is ~94.2 units/period, with peak demand of 160 units in P12. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Cat Tee' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) has exhibited a significant regime shift starting around Period 3. Analyzing demand from Period 3 to Period 13, the average is approximately 89.9 units per period, with a standard deviation of roughly 41 units. This is a substantial increase from the initial samples and early periods. The current date is May 13th, moving into the warmer season which typically sustains demand for jersey basics. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 9 concluded orders (P1-P9). With current On-hand inventory at 113 and In-transit pipeline at 347 (total 460), and an target for L+1 (5 periods) using recent high-demand statistics, we must ensure we cover the potential for another spike similar to Period 7 or 12. Carrying over the established higher mean demand (recent_N=11) ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent the stockouts witnessed between P5 and P9, while calculating Lead Time maintains the proven 4-period cycle.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a jersey T-shirt, which typically sees higher demand during the spring and summer months. Since Period 3 (late February), we have observed a significant demand regime shift. The initial pre-period samples averaged 28.8 units, while the average demand from Period 3 to Period 14 is approximately 88.25 units. There have been several spikes, notably in Period 7 (148 units) and Period 12 (160 units). The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods across all 10 completed replenishment cycles. In Period 14, demand was 70, which is relatively consistent with the new regime mean. With 56 units on hand and 402 in transit, the current pipeline is substantial but necessary given high demand volatility and a 4-period lead time. I will continue to use a recent window (N=12, covering the high-demand regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the higher mean and the variance observed during this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand from Period 3 onwards is ~88 units/period, compared to the early sample mean of ~29. Volume is volatile with peaks over 150 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a basic jersey T-shirt, which typically sees sustained demand in the late spring and summer months. The demand history confirms a significant regime shift starting around Period 3. Since then, demand has been volatile but consistently higher than the initial samples, with a mean demand from Period 3 to Period 15 of approximately 88.5 units and a standard deviation of 39.5. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Currently, we have 45 units on hand and 400 units in the pipeline (orders from P12-P15). Period 16 will see the arrival of the P12 order (111 units), bringing expected available stock to 156. The pipeline includes subsequent orders of 162 (P13), 68 (P14), and 59 (P15). I will use N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire high-demand regime from P3-P15. Setting L to default (4) as the historical lead time matches the promised lead time perfectly.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand since the regime shift in Period 3 has averaged approximately 93 units/period (P3-P16), showing significant volatility with peaks reaching 160. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 12 consecutive observations (P5 through P16). We are currently in early June, where demand for jersey t-shirts remains high. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period history. I'm using recent_N for mu_hat with N=14 (covering the entire post-shift period P3-P16) to capture the higher mean demand (~93) compared to the initial samples (~29). Forecast mu_hat will be (1+L)*93 \u2248 465. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=14 to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation of ~39) observed during this higher demand period. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a jersey T-shirt, which typically maintains steady to high demand during early summer. Since the demand regime shift observed in Period 3, the mean demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to the initial samples. Looking at the last 15 periods (P3-P17), the average demand is approximately 88.7 units per period. The standard deviation over this same period is roughly 36 units. The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods throughout the game history. On-hand inventory is currently 99 units, with 321 units in transit (representing orders from P14-P17). Total pipeline inventory (420 units) roughly covers 4.7 periods of the current mean demand. To maintain the service level while managing holding costs, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the 15 periods since the regime shift (P3-P17) to provide the OR backend with the most accurate representation of the current sustained demand pattern. This covers the lead time plus current review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a basic jersey T-shirt, which typically maintains stable demand through the summer months. Historical lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the most recent arrival from Period 14). Demand patterns since Period 3 have shifted to a significantly higher average compared to the initial samples. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), the mean demand is 82.8 units per period (sample mean: 45, 70, 72, 120, 99, 62). I will set mu_hat based on the average demand of the last 16 periods (since the shift in P3) to capture this higher stabilized regime while smoothing out weekly volatility. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=10 to better reflect the current volatility of this higher demand level. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 105 units with a substantial pipeline of 352 units, ensuring coverage for the next several lead time cycles.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a jersey T-shirt, which typically sees sustained demand during the summer months. Historical evidence from Period 3 onwards confirms a shift to a higher demand regime, with the average demand from Period 10 to Period 19 being approximately 88 units. Recent demand has fluctuated between 62 and 120 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P15-P19). Pipeline inventory (342) plus current on-hand (70) totals 412 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). A safe base stock targeting ~85-90 units/period for 5 periods equals 425-450 units. Therefore, I am maintaining L at calculate (confirmed 4) and setting mu_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture the current summer demand stability (~88 units/period * 5 periods = 440). sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the recent volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (June): Period 10 to Period 19 mean demand is 88 units/period, significantly higher than the initial Q1 average of 29. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is a 'Divided Basics' jersey t-shirt, which is consistently high-demand during the summer season. Looking at the last 10 periods (P11-P20), the mean demand is 92.6 units per period with a standard deviation of 30.6. This is significantly higher than the initial Q1 samples. The lead time remains firmly confirmed at 4 periods (P16 order arrived in P20). I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current summer demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time (4). On-hand inventory is 33, with 380 units in transit, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current average. This strategy ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level capable of handling the current high-demand volatility while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. We are in a high-demand summer period for t-shirts. In Period 21, demand spiked to 211 units, which is significantly above the recent average (~90-100), leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 21 conclude message where the P17 order arrived exactly on time). To account for the recent spike while smoothing for long-term summer demand, I am using a recent window for mu_hat (N=11, covering roughly Period 11 to Period 21) which captures the summer regime. Given the extreme volatility (211 vs recent lows of 62), I am using an explicit sigma_hat estimate to ensure the OR backend sets a high enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts during this peak season. The pipeline inventory (361) is healthy, but on-hand is zero, requiring a robust base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed in Period 21 (211 units), indicating potential mid-summer peak or inventory-constrained latent demand release. Summer regime (June-July) mean demand now exceeds 100 units/period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490003 (Cat Tee) is currently in a high-demand summer regime (July). Period 21 saw a significant spike (211 units) followed by Period 22 demand of 146 units, both of which resulted in total stockouts (ending on-hand 0). The moving average for the last 10 periods (P13-P22) is approximately 107 units, while the peak demand reaches over 210. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current on-hand inventory of 0, we must ensure the pipeline (450 units) and the new order cover the next 5 periods of high summer demand. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead time has been consistently 4 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the elevated summer mean (~107 units/period), resulting in a base stock target that accounts for 5 periods of this heightened demand. This aggressive approach is necessary to recover from stockouts during the peak seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed (July): Demand consistently exceeding 100 units/period (P21: 211, P22: 146). Current stockout for two consecutive periods due to demand outstripping supply arrivals.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand period (late July) for a 'Cat Tee' T-shirt (Divided Basics). Demand has surged significantly, with Period 21 seeing a peak of 211 units and Period 22 witnessing 146 units. The last three periods (P21, P22, P23) have resulted in stockouts because demand exceeded arriving inventory, confirming that we are in a high-demand regime. Average demand from Period 20 to Period 23 is approximately 140 units, which is much higher than the previous summer average of 88. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a significant backlog of demand likely existing (unmet demand does not carry over, but indicates missing potential sales), I must set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent high-demand regime (last 4 periods: P20-P23) to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). L is set to calculated as it has been consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand accelerated in July (P21-P23), with mean demand jumping to ~140 units/period from the June average of ~88. Persistent stockouts since P21 confirm current replenishment is lagging behind the mid-summer peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-summer peak (late July) for this soft jersey t-shirt. The recent demand regime (P21-P24) shows a significant surge, with demand values of 211, 146, 106, and 103. This averages approximately 141.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in the last four consecutive periods (P21-P24) because historical replenishment (based on June averages of ~88) was insufficient for the July peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. To recover from the stockouts and meet the current high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture this July peak. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this surge. These parameters will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current 140+ unit/period demand level across the (L+1) horizon.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early August (Period 26). This product is a 'T-shirt in soft jersey', which is highly seasonal towards summer. Looking at history, demand spiked significantly in July (P21-P23) peaking at 211 and averaging ~140, leading to sustained stockouts. However, Period 25 shows a cooling to 86 units, suggesting the peak may have passed. The current on-hand inventory is 26 units with 691 in-transit. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history (P5, P6, P7... P25 arrivals all reflect L=4). For parameters: 1) L remains 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is extremely stable. 2) For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering Periods 21-25) to capture the high-summer volume (avg ~130) while acknowledging the recent dip. Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of this higher demand helps recover from the previous stockouts and accounts for potential late-summer demand. 3) For sigma_hat, recent_N with N=5 will capture the high volatility seen during the July peak (std is approx 49), ensuring the safety stock is robust against further spikes before the season fully winds down.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak observed in July (P21-P23 average ~140) followed by a potential cooling trend starting in late July (P25 demand 86). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490003 (Cat Tee) is entering mid-August. Historical data shows a clear peak in July (mean ~140, Period 21-23) followed by a cooling trend in late July and early August (Periods 25 and 26 demand were 86 and 82 respectively). This aligns with seasonal patterns for 'Divided Basics' jersey T-shirts, where back-to-school transitions often follow mid-summer peaks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory has recovered to 132 units following the arrival of a large order (188 units). Since demand is stabilizing back toward the pre-peak summer levels (~88 units/period), I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current cooling trend (P22-P26 mean) while maintaining a buffer for late-summer volatility. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same window to reflect the reduced variance compared to the July peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Early August (P25-P26) demand averaged ~84 units/period, down from the July peak average of 140 units/period. Inventory levels have recovered from stockouts.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical data and recent 'Carry-over insights' indicate that the summer peak (July) has passed. Demand reached a high average of ~140 units during the July peak (P21-P24) but has consistently cooled through August. The last three periods (P25-P27) show demands of 86, 82, and 59, respectively, averaging approximately 75 units/period. The current on-hand inventory (224) and in-transit units (382) are high because previous orders were placed during the peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the cooling trend at the end of summer, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this downward shift, which covers the transition from peak to post-peak. This will help prevent further overstocking as we enter the late August/September period.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling trend confirmed: August demand (P25-P27) has dropped to an average of ~75 units/period from the July peak of ~140.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29 (late August). The 'post-summer cooling trend' is firmly established, with demand from Period 25 to Period 28 averaging 79.25 units per period, a significant drop from the July peak average of ~140 units. Inventory has recovered from previous stockouts, currently standing at 359 on-hand with 157 in-transit. Given the product is a Jersey T-shirt, we expect demand to continue stabilizing or further decline as we exit summer. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the recent cooling trend (N=4) to prevent overstocking as the seasonal peak ends, and use recent volatility (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the current post-peak variability.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), we are transitioning from the high summer demand peak (July average ~140) into a lower autumnal regime. Recent demand (P25-P29) has averaged approximately 87 units/period, showing a clear reduction from the July highs. The current on-hand inventory (368 units) and in-transit inventory (30 units) total 398 units. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 4, the protection interval is 5 periods (L+1). At the recent average of 87 units/period, we need approximately 435 units to cover the protection interval. However, because inventory is currently high (368 on-hand) and demand is trending downward, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 10 periods (N=10) to capture this cooling trend (avg ~96 units/period across P20-P29) while maintaining a buffer for the recent Period 29 spike (118). Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 10 periods to reflect recent volatility. A lead time of 4 periods remains consistently verified by historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (September) is averaging ~87 units/period (P25-P29), confirming a significant drop from the July peak (~140).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for this T-shirt SKU. Historically, demand peaked in July (averaging ~140 units/period) and has since cooled in August and early September. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is 81.0 units/period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is high (347 units) with 180 units in-transit (arriving P34), totaling 527 units of pipeline inventory. Given the cooling trend and current inventory surplus relative to an estimated average demand of ~81 units, I will use recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock that reflects the current lower demand regime while avoiding excessive holding costs given the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime confirmed (late Aug/early Sept): Mean demand for P25-P30 slowed to 81.0 units/period, down from the July peak of ~140.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for this t-shirt SKU. Recent demand observations (P25-P31: 86, 82, 59, 90, 118, 51, 28) show a clear cooling trend compared to the July peak (~140). The average demand over the last 7 periods (N=7) is approximately 73.4 units/period, with the most recent week significantly lower at 28. On-hand inventory is currently high (319 units) due to large orders placed during the summer peak arriving just as demand began to subside. Pipeline inventory is 180 units (ordered in P30). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages. Given the cooling trend and high existing stock, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the lower post-summer demand average for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that prevents further overstocking during this lower-demand phase.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' is showing a pronounced cooling trend as we move into late September. Following a summer peak in July (approx. 140 units/period) and a subsequent shift to ~80 units/period in August/early September, the most recent three periods (P30-P32) have seen a further drop to an average of ~38.7 units/period. The current on-hand inventory (282) plus the in-transit order (180 from P30) totals 462 units, which is significantly high given the recent decline. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the cooling demand and high stock levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples to reflect the current lower demand regime (avg ~38) and avoid over-ordering, while maintaining L at calculate to reflect the consistent 4-period delivery cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed in late Sept (P30-P32): Recent average dropped to ~39 units/period, down from the post-summer average of ~81 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Cat Tee' has significantly dropped from its summer peak (~140 units) and its post-summer level (~80 units) to a much lower baseline in late September. Over the last four periods (P30-P33), demand has averaged 41.75 units (51, 28, 37, 51). This suggests a transition into an autumn regime. Current on-hand inventory is 231 units, with 180 units in-transit (ordered P30, expected to arrive in P34). Total pipeline inventory is 411 units. Given the recent average demand of ~42, the current 411 units covers nearly 10 periods of supply, which is well above the required safety stock level for a 4-period lead time. I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering, while maintaining L at 4 as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed starting Period 30: Average demand has decreased to ~42 units/period, down from the post-summer average of ~81.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Cat Tee.' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) has entered an Autumn cooling phase since early September (Period 30). In the last 5 periods (P30-P34), demand has averaged 41 units per period, which is a significant drop from the summer peak average of 140 and the post-summer average of 81. On-hand inventory is currently high at 373 units due to the arrival of the P30 order (180 units) just as demand slowed. Since the lead time is 4 periods, we must provide protection for L+1 (5) periods. Total expected demand for 5 periods at the current rate is ~205 units. With 373 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand levels. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower autumn regime and lead the OR backend to stop ordering until inventory depletes to more efficient levels, avoiding further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed starting Period 30: Average demand has decreased to ~41 units/period (P30-P34), representing a stabilization at roughly half the post-summer average.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-October, well into the 'Autumn' demand regime first identified in Period 30. Recent demand (P30-P35) has averaged ~38.5 units/period (51, 28, 37, 51, 38, 26), which is a significant drop from the post-summer average of ~81 and the July peak of ~140. Currently, on-hand inventory is 347 units with 0 units in-transit. Based on the current average demand of 38.5 units, the pipeline (347 units) covers approximately 9 periods of demand, which far exceeds the lead-time requirement of 5 periods (L+1). Consequently, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand levels using recent_N=6 to capture the stabilization since Period 30, and keep L calculated from reliable historical performance (consistently 4 periods).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490003 (Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a confirmed autumn demand regime. Since Period 30, demand has significantly decelerated, averaging ~41 units/period between P30 and P34, and further dropping to 18 units in Period 36. We are currently in late October (2019/10/21). On-hand inventory is high at 329 units with zero pipeline inventory. Given the current average demand (~30-40 units) and a lead time of 4 periods, we need roughly (4+1)*40 = 200 units to cover the risk period. Since on-hand (329) is substantially higher than this requirement, and we are entering the colder months for a T-shirt SKU, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 periods (P30-P36) to reflect the lower autumn demand level, allowing the OR backend to calculate a lower base stock and avoid ordering against the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter transition confirmed: Demand from P30-P36 has stabilized at an average of ~35.5 units/period, down from the post-summer average of 81. Significant inventory surplus (329 units) exists relative to current demand rates.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/10/28, transitioning into late autumn/early winter. The product is a jersey t-shirt, which typically sees lower demand during this season compared to the summer peak observed earlier. Since Period 30 (September start), demand has stabilized at a much lower regime, averaging approximately 36 units/period over the last 8 weeks (P30-P37). Currently, on-hand inventory is 305 units with 0 in-transit. Given the mean demand of ~36, the current stock covers approximately 8.5 periods, which is significantly more than the (L+1) = 5 period requirement for a lead time of 4. With a high holding cost relative to profit (Ratio 1:4), maintaining such high inventory levels will result in high holding costs. I will set the parameters to reflect this lower demand regime (recent_N=8) to ensure the OR backend does not place unnecessary orders while we bleed down excess stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is a jersey t-shirt. We are in a confirmed low-demand autumn/winter regime that began around Period 30 (September). Demand since Period 35 (the last 4 periods) has been extremely low: 26, 18, 24, and 17, averaging roughly 21 units per period. This is a significant drop even compared to the earlier autumn average of ~35. With an on-hand inventory of 288 units and zero units in-transit, our current stock covers approximately 13-14 weeks of demand at the current rate (288 / 21 \u2248 13.7). Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked relative to the holding cost ($1.0) and profit ($4.0). No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent lower demand regime (last 5 periods) and keep L at default (4) as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Early Winter demand drop: Demand from P35-P38 has stabilized at an even lower average of ~21 units/period, down from the early autumn average of ~35.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late-autumn/winter period (mid-November), which historically exhibits the lowest demand levels for this t-shirt. The recent demand regime (P35-P39) has dropped to an average of ~20 units/period (26, 18, 24, 17, 15). With the current on-hand inventory at 273 units and zero in-transit, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand. At a consumption rate of ~20 units/period, the current inventory provides over 13 periods of coverage, far exceeding the 5-period (L+1) planning horizon. To minimize holding costs and prevent further surplus, no new orders should be placed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to capture this lower volume accurately, and 'calculate' for 'L' as lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime established (starting P35): Mean demand has stabilized at ~20 units/period, the lowest observed level in the year. Significant inventory surplus (273 units) currently covers >10 periods of demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Cat Tee.' (a summer-oriented T-shirt) is currently in a deep winter trough. Demand from P35 to P40 has averaged approximately 18.5 units/period, with the most recent sample at 11 units. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 262 units, which covers roughly 14\u201320 periods of current demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P30 order which arrived in P34. Given the excessive on-hand inventory (262 units) compared to the likely base stock level required for a demand mean of ~20 (which would be around 140-160 units including safety stock for L=4), the OR backend should continue to order 0 units. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (P35-P40) using N=6 to ensure the base stock calculation prevents any unnecessary ordering while inventory burns down.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490003' is in a low-demand winter regime. Reviewing the most recent demand samples from Period 35 to Period 41 (26, 18, 24, 17, 15, 11, 12), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 17.6 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 250 units, which covers more than 14 periods of demand at the current rate (250 / 17.6 \u2248 14.2). The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Given the high carry-over of inventory and the current low demand, no new orders are required to maintain a high service level; the system will continue to burn through existing stock to minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (since Period 35) to capture this winter floor correctly.

The SKU 717490003 (Cotton Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a low-demand winter regime. Current date is December 2nd. Historical demand from Period 35 to Period 42 has consistently been low, averaging approximately 17.8 units per period (min 11, max 26). The current on-hand inventory is 228 units, which covers over 10 periods of demand at the current average rate. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked. No new orders have been placed since Period 30, and none are in transit. Parameters are set to match the recent low-demand regime (N=8: Periods 35-42) to minimize further ordering while managing the existing surplus. L is kept at the default promised lead time of 4, as actual lead times have been consistent with this value.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. The product is a jersey t-shirt, which is showing typical winter seasonality\u2014demand has stabilized at a very low level. Since Period 35, the average weekly demand is approximately 15.4 units, with the most recent sample at only 7 units. On-hand inventory is currently 221 units with no units in transit. Given the current demand rate (~15 units/period), the 221 units on hand constitute more than 14 weeks of supply. Since we are in Period 44 of 47, no further orders are required to satisfy demand for the remainder of the game. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs (Ratio of Profit 4:1 Holding Cost). I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the stable winter regime from P35-P43) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this low-demand state, ensuring the base stock level remains below the current inventory to prevent ordering.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. The product (a T-shirt) is in a deep winter low-demand regime, with demand from Period 40 to 44 averaging only 12 units per period (11, 12, 22, 7, 8). On-hand inventory is 213 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers approximately 17-18 periods of demand. Given the promised lead time (L=4), a target base stock should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, which is roughly 60 units. Since on-hand (213) is significantly greater than the requirements and the game ends in Period 47 (only 3 periods remaining), no new orders are necessary. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand winter regime to prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders as on-hand inventory slowly depletes.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (Dec) confirmed at approximately 12 units/period (P40-P44 average), continuing the decline from the autumn average of ~35.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (late December) managing a basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demand has settled into a low-volume winter regime. Demand over the last 6 periods (P40-P45) has averaged roughly 12.7 units per period (11, 12, 22, 7, 8, 16), which is much lower than the summer peak of 140 or the autumn average of 35. The current on-hand inventory is 197 units, which covers approximately 15 periods of current demand at the observed rate. There is zero inventory in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock level relative to the low seasonal demand, no new orders are required. I will maintain L at the promised 4 periods and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11, covering the period since early November when demand dropped below 20) to reflect the current winter regime and ensure the OR backend suppresses further ordering while excess inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (Dec) confirmed at approximately 13 units/period (P40-P45 range: 7-22), significantly lower than previous seasonal averages.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the final period of the year (2019/12/30). The demand for this SKU (Jersey Basic T-shirt) has settled into a low-volume winter regime. Over the last 7 periods (P40-P46), the mean demand has dropped to approximately 13.1 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 5.2. Our current on-hand inventory is 181 units, which is significantly higher than the projected demand for the next lead time plus review period (5 periods * ~13 units = 65 units). The OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally result in zero orders given this surplus. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the most recent stabilized winter demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical data.
