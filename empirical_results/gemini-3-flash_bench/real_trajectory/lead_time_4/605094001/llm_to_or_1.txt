Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 605094001, which is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs (Underwear). The product description suggests a stable, basic fashion item. The historical demand for the past 5 weeks (158, 154, 201, 140, 103) shows some fluctuation with a mean of 151.2 units per week. There is a slight downward trend in the last two weeks, but without a sustained pattern, I will use the full historical set to establish our baseline. Promised lead time is 4. Since we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to place an order to cover the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1), totaling 5 periods of demand. I will use 'default' for L and sigma_hat, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent average demand level of 151.2 per period, which the OR backend will then scale by (1+L).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The objective is to manage SKU 605094001 (Fred Shortie 3 pack). Historical demand data shows a mean of approximately 151 units per week (Samples: 158, 154, 201, 140, 103). Last period (P1), the demand was unusually low at 33 units. However, since the product is 'Underwear' (a staple/basic item), I expect demand to revert toward the historical mean rather than stay at the P1 level. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 210 units in transit (expected in P5, given the promised lead time L=4). Because we have 0 on-hand and 33 units of lost sales in P1, we are in a stockout situation. The OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to set a base stock level. I will use the historical mean (151) and standard deviation (approx 35) to project demand over the (L+1)=5 period horizon. \u03bc\u0302 = 5 * 151 = 755. \u03c3\u0302 = sqrt(5) * 35 \u2248 78. This ensures the base stock reflects the full lead time plus current period demand. I'll use 'explicit' for mu_hat to stabilize against the P1 outlier and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs, a staple item. Demand in the first two periods was 33 and 21, but sales were 0 because starting on-hand inventory was 0. We have 419 units in transit (210 from P1, 209 from P2). The promised lead time is 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in P1 will arrive during P1+4 = P5. Therefore, we expect no arrivals until Period 5. Historical demand samples (before P1) averaged ~151 units per week, but recent periods (P1-P2) show lower values (33, 21), which likely indicates a data gap or a significant shift, as these are staple basics. Given the promised L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (1+4). I will use the historical mean (approx 151) as a guide for mu_hat to ensure we don't under-order if the P1/P2 dip is temporary, while setting N=5 for sigma to capture volatility. Current pipeline (419) is slightly below the 5-period requirement (approx 750), so the OR backend should generate supplemental orders.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs (Divided Basics), which typically shows stable, non-seasonal demand. Currently, the SKU is in a shell-out state with 0 on-hand inventory and 694 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are at Period 4, the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during this period (Period 4) and will be visible in the Period 4 conclude message (read at Period 5). Historical data (Jan-Feb) shows a mean demand of 151.2 units/week. However, recent demand during the shell-out (Periods 1-3) has been very low (avg 25), likely due to 'sold=0' and possible data artifacts during zero-stock periods. I will stick to the longer-term historical mean to avoid under-ordering once stock arrives. I'll use L=4 (promised) and mu_hat based on the total historical average including the Jan/Feb samples to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) periods of demand. Sigma_hat is set to the default to account for standard volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs (Divided Basics), which typically shows stable, non-seasonal demand. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~151 units/period. However, Game History (Periods 1-4) shows significantly lower demand (avg ~33). This discrepancy suggests the game environment is currently in a lower demand regime or the samples included a different phase. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 780 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect the first arrival during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Thus, zero arrivals through Period 4 is expected behavior for L=4. I will set L=4 (default). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to reflect the actual observed demand (avg 33) rather than the higher pre-game samples, as the last 4 periods are more representative of the current game state. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to match this regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The first shipment (210 units) ordered in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand history shows a recent drop (Period 1-5 mean: 32) compared to the long-term historical samples provided (103-201 range). The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs (Divided Basics), which usually has stable demand but is currently underperforming historical levels. Given on-hand inventory (181) and in-transit units (570), we are currently overstocked relative to current demand trends. I will use recent demand (N=5) to avoid over-ordering further, while maintaining L=4 based on the successful delivery confirmation. This ensures the OR backend uses the lower current demand mean to calculate the base stock while accounting for the confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Current demand regime (P1-P5) is significantly lower than pre-game historical samples (~32 vs ~150).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. We have confirmed the lead time is 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6. This matches the promised lead time. However, there is a significant demand regime shift: pre-game samples averaged ~151, while in-game demand (P1-P6) has averaged ~28.5 (range 11-56). The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs (staple item), and there are no immediate seasonal peaks explaining the crash compared to January/February historicals. We are currently overstocked with 379 on-hand and 361 in-transit, totaling 740 units against a recent weekly demand of ~29. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to captures the current low-demand regime (avg ~27). This will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary new orders while we burn through existing inventory.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 605094001 (cotton jersey underwear) has remained consistently low since the simulation began, averaging approximately 27 units per week over the last 7 periods. This is a significant drop from the pre-game January/early February mean of ~150. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on arrivals from P1, P2, and P3. On-hand inventory is currently high (632 units), which is approximately 11 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate (632 / (mu_hat/5)). My goal is to prevent further stock accumulation and associated holding costs. I will set L to 4. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to accurately capture the current lower demand regime. I will use the default sigma_hat which will be calculated based on the game history samples (excluding pre-game) due to the regime shift.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Historical data prior to the game showed much higher demand (~150/week), but the game history (Periods 1-8) has shown a consistently lower demand regime, averaging 33 units/week (range 11-71). The product description (cotton hipster briefs) doesn't suggest extreme volatility for early Spring. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1-P4 all arrived with lead_time=4). On-hand inventory is high (647) with zero in-transit shipments remaining. Given the current inventory level and the recent demand mean (~33), we have roughly 19 weeks of stock on hand, which is far beyond the (L+1)=5 week requirement. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=8) to reflect the lower demand regime seen in-game compared to the pre-game samples, and use 'calculate' for lead time since the promised lead time of 4 matches observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at a much lower level than pre-game history: mean ~33 (P1-P8). Lead time reliability confirmed at 4 periods over multiple arrivals (P1 through P4).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 605094001 (Underwear) remains significantly lower than pre-game data (actual mean approx 34 vs historical ~150). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 607 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, the inventory covers approximately 17 periods of current demand (607/34), which is far beyond the (L+1)=5 period requirement. My orders in early periods (P1-P4) were based on pre-game history and have created a substantial surplus. No additional units are currently needed. I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the sustained lower demand regime since the game started, while maintaining the 'default' lead time of 4. This ensures that while on-hand inventory is high, the OR backend correctly identifies that no new orders are required to maintain the desired service level.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs (underwear). Historical demand samples from January (avg 151) were significantly higher than current game demand (P1-P10 avg = 35.9). This indicates a strong post-holiday/early-year demand regime shift. On-hand inventory is currently 552 units, while total pipeline inventory is 0. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 4, the target cycle covers (L+1)=5 periods. Based on the most recent 5 periods (avg demand ~39.8), 5 periods of demand equals approximately 200 units. My current on-hand of 552 units is more than double the required base stock for the current regime. Therefore, no new order is needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the current lower demand regime compared to the pre-game samples, and use the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical data and the last 11 periods confirm a stable demand regime significantly lower than the initial pre-game samples (avg ~33 vs ~150). Recent demand has trended slightly upwards (avg of 57 over the last 3 periods) but is well-covered by high on-hand inventory (476 units), which currently represents ~8-10 weeks of stock. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since on-hand inventory is high and there are no units in-transit, I am maintaining parameters that reflect the current regime to avoid over-ordering while the system burns through excess stock. Using recent_N=11 for mu_hat captures the entirety of the low-demand regime since the game began, providing a stable baseline of ~40 units/period (multiplied by 1+L by the backend).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 605094001 (underwear pack) has seen a steady increase in demand over the last four periods (40 to 106), departing from the initial low-demand regime (~33) observed until Period 9. The current date (May 6) suggests a spring/early summer seasonal uptick for this basic apparel category. While demand is increasing, the current on-hand inventory (370) is high compared to the recent mean (last 4 weeks mean = 69.25), and there are no units in transit. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to ensure local inventory covers (L+1) = 5 weeks of demand. 5 * 106 = 530, so we are currently safe with 370 units on hand for the immediate future, but we should start factoring in the higher demand levels to prevent a future stockout. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am shifting to a recent_N strategy (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent uptrend rather than averaging in the very low early-game data or the very high pre-game historical samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Demand is trending upwards (mean 69.25 vs previous 33) as we enter May seasonality.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (2019/5/13). The demand for 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' (underwear) has shown a clear upward shift starting around Period 9. The average demand for the first 8 periods was ~33 units, whereas the last 5 periods (P9-P13) have averaged ~70.8 units (40, 55, 76, 106, 77). This aligns with the transition into warmer months and the May seasonality noted in Carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The OR backend needs to account for this higher demand regime to set an appropriate base stock. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-volume, higher-volatility trend, ensuring the (L+1) period demand is covered. With an on-hand of 293 and in-transit of 82, the system needs to maintain stock against a forecast of ~350 units (5 * 70).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P9-P13): mean increased to ~71 (+115% vs P1-P8) as seasonality takes effect.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. We are in a higher demand regime compared to the start of the simulation, driven by seasonality (May demand mean ~77.4 over P9-P14). The product is cotton-jersey underwear, which sees fairly stable but seasonally reflective demand. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since P9, demand has significantly increased and stayed elevated (approx. 70-100 units/week). My strategy is to use the recent 6 periods (P9-P14) as the basis for the forecast to capture this current trend, as older data (P1-P8) is significantly lower. This will set a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the order period (L+1=5).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P16 (2019/5/27). Demand has shown a clear upward trend since P9, likely due to summer seasonality entering June for basic cotton underwear. Recent demand values are: P11: 76, P12: 106, P13: 77, P14: 98, P15: 123. The mean demand for the last 5 periods is 96, significantly higher than the initial regime (~33) and the pre-game samples from January/early February. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods for all fulfilled orders. The on-hand inventory is now low (72 units), with 271 units currently in-transit (ordered in P13, P14, and P15). We need to maintain higher target stock levels to accommodate the increasing demand trend. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime specifically while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift fully established: mean demand for P11-P15 is ~96, a 35% increase from the previous P9-P13 average (~71) and nearly triple the initial game period average (~33).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 (2019/06/03). The demand for 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' (Underwear) has stabilized into a much higher regime, likely due to summer seasonality. Demand in Period 16 was 153, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average (~91). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and awaiting arrivals. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Our pipeline consists of orders from P13 (82 units), P14 (72 units), P15 (117 units), and P16 (129 units), totaling 400. The P13 order is expected to arrive during the resolution of P17, which will be visible next period. Given the current demand trend (last 4 periods: 106, 77, 98, 123, 153), I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this higher summer baseline (average ~113 per week). This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers the 5 weeks (L+1) of demand needed for the cycle, while the capped order logic handles the immediate gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to summer high: average demand for P12-P16 is 111.4 units, representing a 56% increase over the P9-P13 average (~71) and nearly 4x the initial game periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is entering the peak summer season (June). Demand showed a substantial upward trend from May onwards, peaking at 153 in Period 16 before settling slightly at 93 in Period 17 (likely due to stockouts). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 485 units. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Given the seasonality and recent stockouts, I am targeting a higher base stock to meet peak demand. I'll use a recent 5-period window (P13-P17) to capture the higher May/June demand levels (avg ~109). This recent data better reflects current market conditions than historical pre-game data or early-game lows. mu_hat should reflect demand over L+1 (5) periods. mu_hat = 5 * 109 = 545. sigma_hat will also be based on the last 5 periods to capture increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained through June: Period 13-17 average demand is 108.8, confirming the transition to a high-demand summer regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '605094001' (cotton hipster briefs) is entering a peak summer demand phase (mid-June). Recent demand has shown high volatility (P16: 153, P17: 93, P18: 50), but the carry-over insights and historical samples (pre-game mean ~150) suggest that demand remains much higher than the early-game average (~33). Period 18's drop to 50 might be a weekly fluctuation or reflecting stockouts in previous periods affecting customer behavior, but given we are in June, we must prepare for sustained high demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (22), though a significant pipeline (571 units) is expected to arrive starting next period (orders from P15 onwards). I will use the last 6 periods (P13-P18) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the current higher-demand regime (mean ~82, but including stockout-constrained sales), and maintain the default lead time of 4. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both (L+1) demand coverage and the current volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' (Underwear) is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Calculating demand over the last 7 periods (P13-P19) gives a mean of 89.57. While demand in the last three periods (P17-P19: 93, 50, 68) appears lower than the peak in P16 (153), the historical pre-game data for late June/early July (140-158) suggests that demand remains seasonally strong. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (P13-P15 orders arrived exactly on schedule). Inventory is extremely tight (on-hand 71) after recent stockouts, and with a lead time of 4 periods, we must protect against demand over the next 5 periods (Review + Lead Time). I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the spring average (~33) to the summer regime (~90), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to recover from stockouts while accounting for the recent demand volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 21 (2019/7/1). Demand for the SKU (Fred Shortie 3 pack Underwear) has shown a significant seasonal increase starting from May (Period 13), peaking around early June, and now seems to be normalizing slightly (Period 19-20 demand: 68, 53). Mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) is 83.4, compared to the initial game mean of ~33. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (P13-P16 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). Historical data from January/February 2019 showed demand levels between 103-201, suggesting we are still in the higher-demand half of the year. With 147 units on hand and 401 in transit (orders from P17-P20), we have adequate stock for the immediate weeks but need to maintain a base stock that reflects this higher July/summer regime. Setting N=5 for demand captures the recent softening while acknowledging the higher summer baseline. Setting L method to 'calculate' is appropriate as lead time is consistent and well-documented.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in summer high (July): Period 16-20 mean is 83.4 units, significantly higher than the spring baseline (P1-P8 mean ~33). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Historical demand for this SKU (605094001, cotton jersey underwear) shows several regimes: an initial low (P1-P8 mean ~33), a transition in May (P9-P13 mean ~71), and a peak summer high (P14-P17 mean ~116). Recent periods show a stabilization followed by a slight cooling in demand (P18-P21 mean ~63). Our carry-over insights correctly identified the shift to summer, but we are now seeing the plateau/slight decline common in post-peak seasonality. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand + In-transit (232 + 260 = 492) is currently sufficient to cover over 6 periods of demand at the recent average. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the broader summer average (mean ~79) while accounting for the recent deceleration, and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to capture volatility during this higher demand phase. This ensures we maintain a safe base stock without over-ordering as we move past the July peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in summer high (July): Period 18-21 mean (~63) shows a cooling from the June peak (~116), indicating a shift from growth to a stable summer-end plateau.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand has transitioned from the late May/early June peak (mean ~115) to a more stable summer level. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is approximately 61.4 units, which is significantly lower than the preceding peak but higher than the initial spring baseline (~33). Product is basic underwear (605094001), which usually exhibits stable demand after initial seasonal transitions. Lead time remains consistently reliable at 4 periods based on clinical arrivals (P13-P18 orders arriving exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory (336) plus in-transit stock (190) totals 526 units. Setting mu_hat to look at the last 5 periods (N=5) captures the recent stabilization. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on the last 5 periods to reflect current volatility accurately. This configuration maintains a safe stock level (Target Stock \u2248 307 units given mu_hat=61.4*5) while avoiding excessive holding costs, as on-hand is currently higher than the base stock requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late July (P18-P22): Average demand decreased to ~61 units, signaling a post-June peak correction.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '605094001' (cotton hipster briefs) is currently in a stable late-July phase. Demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23: 68, 53, 82, 54, 52) has averaged 61.8 units, confirming a cooldown from the June peak. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory (318) plus in-transit stock (156) totaling 474 units, and a forecasted demand over (L+1)=5 periods of approximately 309 units (61.8 x 5), the system is currently overstocked relative to the base stock target (z* for 19:1 ratio is ~1.645). I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this recent stabilization for mu_hat and sigma_hat. No order is expected this period from the backend because the pipeline exceeds the projected base stock.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for the 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' (Underwear) has stabilized after the June peak. Recent demand observations (P21-P24: 82, 54, 52, 43) indicate a downward trend from the high summer regime. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 4 weeks is 57.75, compared to the June peak which saw demands over 150. Based on seasonal trends for basic underwear, demand often cools in late summer before another potential shift. We currently have 317 units on-hand and 114 in-transit (ordered P21 and P22), both of which are scheduled to arrive within the next two periods given the reliable 4-period lead time. With a total pipeline of 431 units and current demand around 50-60, we are well-covered for the (L+1)=5 period window. To avoid excessive holding costs as demand softens, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the latest decelerating demand trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (late July): Demand has softened significantly from the June peak, with the P21-P24 average falling to 57.75 units (-40% vs P12-P16).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/08/05), we have entered a late summer/early autumn phase where demand for 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' (cotton hipster briefs) has significantly cooled from the June peak. Recent demand samples (P22-P25: 54, 52, 43, 33) follow a downward trend, with the P21-P25 average now standing at 49.2 units, significantly lower than the P13-P20 average of ~85 units. Inventory is currently high (on-hand: 310, in-transit: 88, total: 398), which covers roughly 8 periods of current demand levels. There is no immediate need to order given the current overstock relative to the downward-trending demand. Lead time remains consistently reliable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 captures this cooling trend to prevent the OR engine from over-ordering while we deplete existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (August): Demand has declined to a late-summer baseline (P22-P25 average ~46) compared to the June peak (~116) and July average (~63).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized at a lower late-summer/pre-autumn level. The most recent demand period (P26) recorded 35 units, and the average over the last four periods (P23-P26) is 40.75 units. This is a significant decrease from the June peak (~116) and the early July average (~63). On-hand inventory is currently high at 363 units, with 0 units in transit following the arrival of the P22 order. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, my total coverage (on-hand + pipeline) should ideally cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current demand rate of ~41 units/period, 5 periods of demand equals ~205 units. Since on-hand inventory (363) comfortably exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent lower demand trend (approx 40 units/period * 5 = 200), which will result in no order being placed by the OR backend due to the inventory surplus. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a late-summer baseline following the June peak. Over the last five periods (P23-P27), average demand is 40.8 units, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~110. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 322 units with 0 units in-transit. With an expected total demand over the lead time and review period (L+1 = 5 periods) of approximately 204 units (5 * 40.8), the current inventory of 322 units is more than sufficient. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P23-P27) and 'calculate' for L to remain consistent with observed lead times.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Demand has shifted from a June/July peak to a stable late-summer/pre-autumn baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged 37.0 units, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~110. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 289) with zero in-transit, as previous large orders place during the growth phase have all arrived. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to recent demand (covering roughly 7-8 periods of demand), the OR backend will naturally minimize ordering. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this lower stabilized demand regime, ensuring the system doesn't over-order based on previous seasonal spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late-summer baseline: average demand for P24-P28 is 37.0 units, indicating the end of the summer seasonal peak.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September (Period 30), and demand has clearly stabilized at a late-summer/early-autumn baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), demand was [33, 35, 41, 33, 26], averaging 33.6 units. This is significantly lower than the peak summer demand (>100 units) and aligns with the initial game period baseline (~33). There are currently no units in transit, and on-hand inventory is 263. Given the Lead Time of 4 periods and a service window requirement of L+1=5 periods, the expected demand across that window is approximately 168 units (33.6 * 5). Since on-hand inventory (263) already exceeds this requirement, no new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect this current stabilized demand regime, and L to calculate to maintain the proven 4-period lead time.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for the hipster brief (SKU 605094001) has continued its post-summer decline, stabilizing at a late-summer/early-autumn baseline. Over the last five periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 30.8 units (35, 41, 33, 26, 19), significantly lower than the June peak and even the August baseline. On-hand inventory is currently 244 units with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods (L=4) and a review period of 1, the system must cover demand for approximately 5 periods. At the current demand rate (~31 units/period), the total requirement is approximately 155 units. With 244 units on-hand, there is a surplus to current needs. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this most recent downward trend and avoid over-ordering during this seasonal cooling phase. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (September): Demand has declined further to an early-autumn baseline, with the P26-P30 average falling to 30.8 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 605094001 has stabilized at a low level following the summer seasonal peak. For the last five periods (P27-P31), demand has averaged 28.4 units, significantly lower than the June peak of 111+ units. The on-hand inventory is currently 221 units with no units in transit. Given the current average demand (~28 units) and the (L+1) planning horizon of 5 periods, the required base stock is approximately 140-150 units. Since current on-hand inventory (221) exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current post-summer baseline accurately without being anchored to the much higher summer volumes.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 605094001 (cotton hipster briefs) has stabilized into a post-summer seasonal low. As of Period 33 (Sept 23), the average demand over the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is approximately 26.2 units, a significant reduction from the June peak of ~116 and the July average of ~63. Current on-hand inventory is 191 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, my goal is to cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At the current rate of ~26 units/period, expected demand for the horizon is ~130 units. Since current on-hand inventory (191) exceeds this requirement and there is a holding cost of $1.0/unit, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect the stabilized early-autumn demand regime and maintain the default lead time (L=4) as it has been consistently reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at autumn baseline (late-Sept): P28-P32 average demand is ~26 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand has stabilized at an autumn baseline; although Period 33 showed a slight uptick to 48, the overall trend since late August (Period 29 onwards) remains low, with a mean of approximately 29.2 units per period (P29-P33). On-hand inventory is currently 143 units with no units in transit. Given the lead time (L) of 4, the target base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the recent average of ~30 units, the required base stock is ~150 units. Since on-hand inventory (143) is very close to this requirement and holding costs are being prioritized over stockout risk given the current high inventory levels and low demand trend, I will continue to use the default lead time (4) and base the demand forecast (mu_hat) on the most recent 5 periods (P29-P33) to capture the current autumn baseline. Sigma_hat is also set to the recent 5-period window to reflect current volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime that has stabilized at a lower baseline. Recent demand (P30-P34) has been 19, 23, 30, 48, and 32, averaging approximately 30.4 units. Period 33 showed a slight spike (48), but P34 returned to the lower thirties (32), aligning with the autumn stabilization noted in carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 111 units with 45 in-transit (placed P34). Given L=4, the base stock targets demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the current mean of ~30.4, expected demand over 5 periods is ~152. Total pipeline (111 + 45 = 156) already covers this, so the OR backend will likely order 0 or very small amounts to maintain this buffer without incurring excessive holding costs. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent autumn demand levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand for 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' (underwear) has stabilized at an autumn baseline. The recent 5-period average (P31-P35) is 32.6 units. While the historical pre-game data showed a significant spike in January, current trends are much lower. On-hand inventory is 81 and in-transit is 83 (ordered in P34 and P35), totaling 164 units against a weekly demand of ~33 units and a 4-period lead time. This pipeline is sufficient for approximately 5 weeks of coverage (L+1). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) and sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the current stable autumn demand regime while ignoring the distant summer highs and the disconnected historical pre-game figures. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical game arrivals.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand has stabilized at an autumn baseline; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is 35.2 units. Recent periods show: P32(30), P33(48), P34(32), P35(30), P36(36). The Spike in P33 appears to be an outlier or minor fluctuation within a generally stable low-demand window. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 45 and in-transit at 117 (orders from P34, P35, P36), the pipeline is sufficient to cover the current demand rate and lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized autumn regime and 'default' for L as the promised lead time of 4 is reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at autumn baseline (late Oct): P32-P36 average demand is 35.2 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand has stabilized at an autumn baseline; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is 34.8 units, consistent with the late October regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (17 units), and there is 159 units in-transit (orders from P34, P35, P36, and P37). The first of these orders (P34: 45 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P38) and will be visible at the start of P39. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stable autumn demand (approx. 35 units/period) while lead time is set to default (promised 4). This configuration ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while avoiding excessive holding costs given the lower seasonal demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs, which generally sees stable demand outside of seasonal peaks. Demand has stabilized at an autumn baseline; the P34-P38 average is 33.6 units, very close to the late-October carry-over insight of 35.2. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P34 order arrived in P38). With on-hand inventory at 20 units and total in-transit at 142 (orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38), we are entering the pre-holiday period. Historical data from early 2019 (Jan/Feb) showed demand between 103 and 201, suggesting a potential year-end or early-year volume increase. However, game-start demand in Feb was much lower (~33). I will use recent_N=5 to capture the current stable autumn demand (mean ~33.6) while maintaining a safe stock level as we approach potential holiday-driven shifts. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized through October: P34-P38 average demand is 33.6 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

Current date is 2019/11/11. The demand regime has stabilized at an autumn baseline. The average demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) is 34.6 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P34 order arrived P38, P35 order arrived P39). Inventory management: On-hand (21) + In-transit (131) = 152. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current stable autumn demand (~34.6 * 5 = 173). sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This ensures we maintain enough stock for the lead time plus one review period while considering the late-year seasonal baseline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a stable autumn demand regime. Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), demand has averaged 35.6 units (36, 28, 42, 37, 35), which is very consistent with the carry-over insight from Period 39 (33.6). We are approaching late November and December, which for basic underwear/shorties might see a slight holiday lift, but current data does not yet show a significant spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by the arrival of orders from P34, P35, and P36 exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 20, with 139 units in transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40). I will use recent_N (N=5) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stabilized autumn plateau, while maintaining the 'calculate' method for Lead Time as it has proven reliable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in Period 42. Demand in Period 41 was unusually low (14 units), contrasting with the Oct-Nov average of ~33 units. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P37-P41: 28, 42, 37, 35, 14), the mean is 31.2. The on-hand inventory is 48, with 135 units in transit (expected arrivals in P42, P43, P44, P45). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given we are approaching the holiday/Black Friday period, demand for basics like cotton jersey hipster briefs is likely to see a significant seasonal spike. The pre-game historical samples (Jan/Feb) showed values between 103 and 201, significantly higher than the current autumn baseline. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for this anticipated seasonal increase, targeting a weekly mean of 75 units (effectively double the current baseline but conservative relative to Jan/Feb peaks) to ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility and the backend will adjust for the planning horizon.

Carry-over insight: Anticipating holiday seasonal spike (Late Nov/Dec): Increasing forecast baseline for (L+1) horizon to bridge current autumn baseline with confirmed high-demand levels seen in pre-game Jan/Feb history.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering the December holiday peak (current date 2019/12/02). Period 42 showed a significant demand surge to 143 units, confirming the start of this seasonal spike. Traditional retail records (pre-game history) show January/February demand levels around 150-200. With 0 on-hand inventory and 200 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42), we are currently stock-outed and vulnerable. The next four arrivals are estimated to be: ~27 (P39), ~42 (P40), ~38 (P41), and ~93 (P42). Given the demand of 143 in P42, these upcoming arrivals are likely insufficient to cover the (L+1) horizon (Periods 43-47). I will increase mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to reflect a high-demand holiday forecast of ~150 units per period (multiplied by L+1=5), totaling 750. I will keep sigma_hat at a default level reflecting the higher recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed at Period 42: Demand surged to 143 units (+1000% from previous week), aligning with pre-game January peak levels.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the middle of a high-volatility holiday seasonal transition (December). After a massive demand spike in Period 42 (143 units), demand dropped sharply to 10 units in Period 43, which is likely a temporary correction or data noise before the final December peaks. Historical pre-game data from Jan/Feb showed sustained high demand (~150). With 17 on-hand and 399 in-transit, we must bridge the (L+1) horizon which includes the rest of December. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set a high explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR backend maintenance of a high base stock, anticipating further holiday surges before the game concludes at Period 47. Sold-out risk in the coming weeks is higher than the holding cost risk given the $19 margin.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: Demand surged to 143 (P42) then dropped to 10 (P43). Predicting sustained high mean demand (>100) for the final 4 periods based on pre-game January history.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), approaching the game's end at Period 47. Demand has shown high volatility recently with a spike to 143 (P42) followed by a drop to 10 (P43) and 35 (P44). Based on pre-game January/February history (avg ~150), we anticipate high demand for the remaining periods (Christmas/New Year/Early Jan season). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (24), but there is a massive in-transit pipeline (588 units) due to aggressive orders placed in P42-P44. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. My objective is to ensure we cover the remaining 3 periods of the game (45, 46, 47). The (L+1) horizon covers 5 periods, but we only have 3 periods left. Since we cannot cancel orders and the pipeline is already very large (588), I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect a high-demand forecast (~130/period) while allowing the OR backend's inventory reconciliation to prevent over-ordering, as 588 units in transit already far exceeds expected needs for the remaining 3 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand period (Dec-Jan) confirmed: High volatility observed (P42: 143, P43: 10, P44: 35). Forecasting mean demand of ~130 for the final game phase to align with pre-game Jan historical levels and capture late-December shopping peaks.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the holiday season. Historical pre-game data for January (weeks 1-5) shows demand consistently between 103 and 201 units, which aligns with recent volatility (P42 demand was 143). With lead time confirmed at 4 periods, my decisions now impact arrivals for the final period (P51). On-hand inventory is currently 0, but a large order from P42 (93 units) should arrive this period (P46), followed by significantly larger orders (226, 231, 241) in subsequent periods. Since the game ends after Period 50, I will use an explicit forecast to maintain high service levels during this final peak. I am setting mu_hat based on an expected weekly demand of ~130 units (derived from pre-game Jan averages) multiplied by (1+L). This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock high enough to cover the end-of-year holiday surge and early January demand, despite the high volatility observed in the last few weeks.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), approaching the end of the game and the post-holiday period. This is the final ordering period. Historical demand for early January (pre-game) was very high (avg ~150). However, game observations (P42nd-P46th) show high volatility with an average around 63, significantly lower than the pre-game Jan samples but higher than the autumn baseline. Given we have 804 units in-transit and only 25 on-hand, the pipeline is heavily loaded from large orders placed in P43-P45. These units (698 cumulative from P43-P45) are expected to arrive in Periods 47, 48, and 49 respectively. Since this is the final decision point, the primary goal is to ensure coverage for the immediate demand without over-ordering, as excess inventory at the end carries holding costs and no future reward. I will maintain a high mu_hat of 130 (aggregated over L+1) to ensure the OR logic accounts for the historical Jan peak, though the capped policy will likely limit orders due to the massive pipeline.
