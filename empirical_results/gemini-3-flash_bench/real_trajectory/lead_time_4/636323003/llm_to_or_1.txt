Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data shows a clear upward trend in demand: 19, 46, 48, 62, 85. This suggests the product ('Skinny H.W Ankle Queens') is gaining traction or entering a busier season. Currently, we have zero inventory on-hand and in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are observing a strong upward regime (mean of last 5 is ~52, but the most recent is 85), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth (avg 65) while being slightly conservative toward the most recent spike. For L, I will use 'default' (4) as we have no historical arrival data to suggest a deviation. For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=3 will better reflect the recent volatility compared to the full history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18) for SKU 636323003 (Ladies Denim Trousers). In Period 1, we had zero on-hand inventory, so even though demand was 67, 0 units were sold. An order of 96 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we expect this order to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Demand history shows a clear upward trend: 19, 46, 48, 62, 85, and most recently 67. The average demand of the last 4 samples is 65.5. Given the high stockout risk and the 'Skinny H.W Ankle' product type, which is popular in spring, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime. L is set to default (4). The backend will calculate base_stock to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans'. We are currently in late February (Period 3, 2019/2/25). Historical demand showed a steady climb from 19 to 85 units through early February. Recently, demand has spiked significantly (Period 1: 67, Period 2: 173), suggesting a spring fashion trend or seasonal shift. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) with 184 units in transit (ordered in P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (Period 1) are expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in P6). Since we have no completed arrivals yet, we adhere to the promised lead time of 4. For demand forecasting, the last 5 samples (from the provided list) plus the 2 recent periods show a clear upward regime change. Averaging the 5 provided historical samples (19, 46, 48, 62, 85) gives ~52. Adding P1 (67) and P2 (173) shows a rapid acceleration. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this rising trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, as the most recent data points are most representative of the current spring demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 2019: Mean increased from ~40 to 120+ units/week as spring season approaches.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 4 (2019/3/4). The item is Ankle-length jeans, which are entering a spring seasonal peak. Historical demand samples (before P1) were low (19-85), but actual demand in P1-P3 has spiked significantly to 67, 173, and 156 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time (L=4) means the first order placed in P1 is not expected to arrive until P5 (visible P6). Total In-transit is 354 (96+88+170). The carry-over insight correctly identified the regime shift; however, demand is even higher than initially estimated. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility spring regime. I will stick to the 'default' (promised) lead time of 4 until we see confirmation of arrival times in the period records.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~60 to ~130 units/week (+116%) during Feb-Mar spring transition.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees a demand surge during the spring season. Historical demand for the last four weeks (67, 173, 156, 110) shows a significant shift compared to January data, averaging ~126.5 units/week. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase (making it visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 580 units in-transit. To ensure we cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 weeks), we need a stock level that accounts for the current high-demand regime. Using the last 4 samples for mu_hat better reflects the spring trend than the full history. Sigma is set based on the recent volatility observed since the regime shift.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The first shipment (ordered Period 1) arrived in Period 5 with a lead time of 4, matching the promised lead time. The product is 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' (Ladies Denim), which typically sees strong demand in the spring transition (March/April). Historical demand for the last five periods (67, 173, 156, 110, 67) averages 114.6 units/week. While demand dipped to 67 in the most recent period, the previous three weeks saw much higher volume, suggesting a jump from the initial January basement levels of ~40. Given the L=4 promised lead time, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With 29 on-hand and 627 in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), the pipeline is substantial. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand spring regime while smoothing out the recent spike and dip. I will stick to 'default' for L as the first arrival confirmed the promised 4-period lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late March (Period 7), managing 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' jeans. Historical demand reflects a clear shift in February/March when demand jumped from an average of ~44 (early January) to an average of ~135 in February, and slightly stabilized around ~95 in the last two weeks of March. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrivals in Period 5 (ordered P1) and Period 6 (ordered P2). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (10 units), but we have a large pipeline (549 units in-transit), including orders from P3 (170) and P4 (226) expected to arrive in Period 7 and 8 respectively. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher late-winter/spring volume (avg ~123) while smoothing recent volatility. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the increased variance seen during this shift. L will be set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now established in the history.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees strong demand in spring. The carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift from ~40-60 units/week to 120+ units/week starting in February/March. Looking at demand from Period 4 onwards (110, 67, 107, 121), the mean is approximately 101 units/week. While Period 5 was lower (67), the last two weeks have stabilized around 114 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived P5, Period 2 arrived P6, Period 3 arrived P7). The in-transit pipeline is 513 units, covering orders from Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7. The OR backend will calculate base stock for L+1 (5 periods). Using N=4 for mu_hat captures the current high-demand regime established since the start of March, balancing the early-March dip with the recent recovery.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent (confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees high demand in early spring (Feb-March) and stabilizes as we move further into April. Historical demand samples showed a peak in Feb/March (up to 173 units) but the last two weeks have shown a cooling trend (121 and 74 units). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 211 units, with additional in-transit stock of 287 (the orders from periods 5, 6, and 7 arriving shortly). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current demand stabilization following the spring peak (average of 110, 67, 107, 121, 74 is approximately 96). Given the volatility during the seasonal transition, I will use a larger N for sigma_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock. This will allow the OR backend to prevent over-ordering as the initial spring surge subsides while maintaining enough stock for current sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend: Post-spring peak (Feb-Mar), demand has stabilized from ~140 units/week to ~100 units/week in April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The product is Ankle-length jeans, which saw a peak in late February and March (likely a spring fashion peak). Demand in April has dropped significantly (74 and 22 in the last two weeks), confirming the 'cooling trend' noted in Period 9 carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is 533 units (332 on-hand + 201 in-transit), which is very high given the recent demand slump. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent in all observed arrivals. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining demand regime, I will use a shorter window (recent_N where N=3) for mu_hat to capture the downward trend in demand (averaging ~72 units/week over the last 3 weeks: 121, 74, 22), while maintaining a standard volatility estimate (sigma_hat) to protect against demand spikes. Lead time remains 'default' (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend established in April: Mean demand dropped from ~130 units/week (March) to ~72 units/week (last 3 weeks).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' has moved past its spring peak (Feb-Mar) where demand was averaging ~130 units/week. In April (Periods 8-10), demand has significantly cooled to 74, 22, and 31 units respectively, averaging ~42 units/week over the last three weeks. Currently, we have 311 units on-hand and 191 in-transit, which is excessive given the new lower demand regime. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods. I am setting L to 'default' (4) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the April cooling trend (Avg ~39.5 units * 5 weeks = 197.5). The OR backend will likely order 0 units this period due to the high inventory position (311 on-hand vs a suggested base stock level near 250-300), which is correct to minimize holding costs for this cooling trend.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' is an ankle-length denim product, which typically experiences a demand peak during the early spring (February/March) and cools down as late spring/summer approaches. The historical data confirms this: demand peaked at 173 in Period 2 and has since dropped significantly, with the last four periods showing 74, 22, 31, and 18 units. The average demand over the last four weeks is ~36.25 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (427 units) due to large orders placed during the peak arriving now (134 units arrived last period). The pipeline only has 57 units (ordered in Period 9, expected in Period 13). With lead time confirmed at exactly 4 periods and a cooling demand regime, the current stock (427) + in-transit (57) far exceeds several months of expected demand. I will use a recent_N of 4 to reflect this lower demand regime (avg ~36/week) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will correctly result in no further orders being placed until inventory is drawn down.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed: Mean demand dropped from ~130 units/week (March) to ~36 units/week (last 4 periods), likely due to the end of the spring denim peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' has significantly cooled following the February-March spring peak. Over the last four periods (Period 9-12), demand has averaged 23.75 units per week, which is a massive drop from the March peak of ~130 units. We are currently overstocked with 403 units on-hand and an additional 57 units in-transit (ordered Period 9, expected Period 13), against a weekly demand of less than 30 units. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods as promised. Given the high on-hand inventory (covering roughly 17 weeks of current demand) and the $1.0 holding cost vs $4.0 profit, the priority is to avoid further ordering and burn through existing stock. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the 23-25 units/week regime and use default lead time and sigma calculations. The OR backend will naturally zero out the order given the large inventory surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-375.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Historically, this SKU (high-waisted skinny jeans) saw a significant spring peak in February and March (avg. ~120 units/week), but demand has sharply decelerated moving into the warmer summer months. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13), actual demand has averaged 22.4 units/week (sampled: 22, 31, 18, 24, 17), confirming the 'cooling trend' noted in carry-over insights. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (443 units) relative to this new demand regime. With Lead Time (L) consistent at 4 periods, we need enough stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. At current rates, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 112 units. Since 443 >> 112, we are heavily overstocked and should not place new orders. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=5) and stick with the default Lead Time calculation as it remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to let inventory bleed down to reduce holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed: May demand has further stabilized to a low mean of ~20-25 units/week (P9-P13), following the end of the spring denim peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens) is experiencing a post-spring cooling period. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P9-P14) shows demand has dropped significantly and stabilized at a low mean: 22, 31, 18, 24, 17, 11 (average ~20.5 units/week). Currently, there are 432 units on-hand with zero in-transit, which covers more than 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, the target service level (q = 0.8) is already heavily exceeded by the current safety stock. No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime shift (last 6 periods) to prevent the OR backend from over-projecting based on the March peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at ~20 units/week during May (P9-P14), down from spring peak of 130+ units/week.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The SKU (Ankle-length jeans) has transitioned from a high-demand spring peak (Feb-Mar, ~130 units/week) into a low-demand summer baseline. Demand over the last 7 periods has stabilized significantly, averaging ~20 units/week (last 3 periods: 17, 11, 18). Currently, on-hand inventory is very high at 414 units, which covers over 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. With a holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0, maintaining high inventory is costly. No orders have been placed recently, and none are in transit. I will set my parameters based on this recent low-demand regime (N=7 to capture the period from April 8 to May 20) to prevent the OR engine from ordering more and to allow existing stock to deplete. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-06-03. Historical demand confirms a significant cooling trend following the spring denim peak. Demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has been 24, 17, 11, 18, and 14, averaging approximately 16.8 units per week. The on-hand inventory is currently very high at 400 units, while the pipeline is empty. Given that the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1) is only around 84 units, the current stock is more than sufficient to cover demand for many weeks. Holding costs of $1.0/unit/period are substantial relative to the $4.0 profit. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N (N=5) to reflect the low-demand regime and use default for L and sigma_hat. The OR backend will naturally result in zero orders due to the high on-hand surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at low levels confirmed: June demand continues at a low mean of ~15-20 units/week (P12-P16), consistent with post-spring seasonality for this SKU.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019/6/10. The SKU (Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans) is in a low-demand summer phase following a spring peak. Demand over the last 6 periods (P12-P17) has been consistently low, with samples: 24, 17, 11, 18, 14, 9. The mean demand for this recent regime is approximately 15.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 391 units with zero units in-transit, which is significantly higher than the required safety stock for the current demand level. At a mean of 15.5 units/week across 5 periods (L+1), the target base stock would be around 77 units (plus safety stock). Since 391 units >> target, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this stabilized low-demand regime, and L remains at the promised default of 4 (verified by history).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Ankle-length jeans) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime following its spring peak. Current demand (Periods 14-18) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 12.2 units/week (range: 9-18), showing low volatility. The on-hand inventory is 382 units with zero in-transit, which is significantly higher than the required safety stock for the current demand level given a 4-period lead time. At current demand rates, the current inventory will last over 30 weeks. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods. Since we are severely over-stocked relative to current demand and the carry-over insights confirm this cooling trend is sustained (post-peak June), I will set lead time to 'default' and use a 'recent_N' approach for demand parameters with N=6 (capturing the stable May/June period) to accurately reflect the lower required base stock and prevent any further ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a very low-demand summer phase following its spring peak. Recent demand has dropped significantly, with the last five periods (P15-P19) showing demand of 18, 14, 9, 9, and 5 units respectively (mean of ~11 units/week). My current on-hand inventory is 377 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate and a holding cost of $1/unit. To avoid accumulating excessive holding costs, I am setting parameters to ensure no new orders are placed. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the most recent low-demand regime (June performance). The baseline lead time remains 4 periods as observed consistently in historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand further declined in late June: P17-P19 mean dropped to ~7 units/week, down from the May/early June mean of ~15-20 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. We are dealing with 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' denim jeans. The inventory is significantly overstocked with 340 units on hand, while recent demand has plummeted following the spring peak. Although Period 20 saw a small spike (37 units), the prior three periods (P17-P19) averaged only ~7.7 units/week. This SKU is clearly in a low-demand summer phase. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, and the high current inventory level (approx. 40+ weeks of supply at current rates), the OR backend should not place any new orders. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 17-20 mean is ~15 units), and the default calculation for lead time (4 periods). This will result in a base stock level far below current on-hand inventory, effectively halting ordering and minimizing further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand spike to 37 units in P20 interrupts the previous low trend of ~7-9 units, but overall mean remains low (~15 units/week) for the June-July transition.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' has recently spiked unexpectedly: P21 demand was 65 units, following a P20 demand of 37 units. This contrasts significantly with the June mean which was < 10 units/week. This suggests a mid-summer sales event or a seasonal shift in July for this item. However, the current on-hand inventory is 275 units, which is extremely high given the current demand levels (even with the spike, 275 units covers over 4 weeks of demand at the high end). Lead times have consistently been 4 periods. Since on-hand inventory is high and there are no units in-transit, I will use a 'recent_N' approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward trend while allowing the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic to correctly suppress new orders until the existing stockpile is depleted. L will remain at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Demand spike detected in early July: P21 demand reached 65 units, a significant increase from the June mean of ~10 units. This suggests a mid-summer demand regime shift.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. A major demand surge has been confirmed over the last three periods (P20: 37, P21: 65, P22: 144). The last period (P22) demand of 144 units indicates a return to peak spring levels, likely due to a mid-summer sale or seasonal peak for skinny denim. This constitutes a significant regime shift from the previous low-demand period (averaging ~10-15 units). On-hand inventory has dropped rapidly to 131 units, and there is zero inventory in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we must set parameters that allow for aggressive replenishment to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) of this new high-demand regime. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this acceleration (mean \u2248 82/week), and sigma_hat is adjusted to account for the high volatility observed during this spike. L remains default as historical arrivals consistently show 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Demand accelerated from 37 (P20) to 144 (P22), marking a new high-demand regime averaging ~82 units/week over the last 3 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a mid-summer demand surge for this SKU (Ankle-length jeans). In Period 23, demand was 107 units, following 144 units in P22 and 65 in P21. The mean demand of this new regime (P21-P23) is approximately 105 units/week, a significant increase from the June lows of ~10 units. This pattern suggests a late-summer/back-to-school peak for denim. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical observations (P5-P13) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. My calculation for mu_hat centers on this new regime: (1 + L) * average(P21, P22, P23) = 5 * 105.33 = 526.67. For volatility, I will use the standard deviation of these three recent points (approx 40), scaled by sqrt(5) to account for lead time, resulting in an explicit sigma_hat of 90. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand through the 4-period lead time plus the review period, while accounting for the high volatility seen during this regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Demand mean increased to ~105 units/week (P21-P23) from June mean of ~10 units/week, likely reflecting early back-to-school or late-summer denim shopping trends. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime likely driven by late-summer or back-to-school shopping (Ankle-length jeans). Demand spiked significantly between Period 21 and 23 (65, 144, 107 units), representing a major shift from the June lows (~10 units). Period 24 demand was 46, but this was constrained by a total stockout (ending inventory 0). On-hand inventory is 0, and the previous order from P23 (174 units) is expected to arrive in Period 27 (standard lead time = 4). With lead time L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent high-demand regime (P21-P24), the average demand is (65+144+107+46)/4 = 90.5 units/week. Setting mu_hat to 452.5 (90.5 * 5) and using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to capture recent volatility. The L parameter is kept at default (4) as arrivals have historically been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Demand mean averaged ~90 units/week over the last 4 periods (P21-P24), though P24 was limited by a stockout.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 5, 2019. We are in a mid-summer high-demand regime, likely driven by back-to-school shopping for denim. Demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has been 65, 144, 107, 46 (stockout limited), and 80 (stockout limited), averaging ~88.4 units/week. Periods 24 and 25 resulted in stockouts with 0 on-hand inventory. The first order of the new surge (174 units from P23) is scheduled to arrive during the resolution phase of this period (P26) as the promised lead time remains a consistent 4 periods. However, until that arrives, we remain in a stockout. I am setting L to 'default' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this high-demand summer regime while smoothing the volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased variance seen during this surge. These parameters will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period, aiming to replenish stock and meet the sustained summer demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand late-summer/back-to-school regime. In Period 26, demand was 136, following 80 in P25 and a stockout-limited 46 in P24. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 102 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we are awaiting arrivals from orders placed in P23, P24, and P25. Based on the 4-period lead time, the P23 order (174 units) is expected to arrive during Period 27 (visible in Period 28), providing some relief to the stockout. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime (roughly 102 per week) over the 5-period risk window (L+1) results in 510. sigma_hat is set to capture the increased volatility of this surge.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (late-summer/back-to-school) confirmed for August: Mean demand is approximately 102 units/week (P22-P26), up from ~10 units in June.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Ankle-length jeans' is currently in a high-demand late-summer/back-to-school regime. In Period 27, we finally saw the arrival of the Period 23 order (174 units) exactly on the promised 4-period lead time, which leaves us with 65 units on-hand. Demand over the last 6 periods (P22-P27) has been: 144, 107, 46 (stockout), 80 (stockout), 136, 109. Adjusted for stockouts in P24 and P25, the mean demand is roughly 110-120 units per week. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this current high-demand regime, which provides a mu_hat covering the (L+1) period window. Using recent_N for sigma_hat will account for the higher volatility seen during this surge. The L parameter remains at default (4 periods) as recent performance matches the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $518.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand late-summer/back-to-school regime. In Period 28 (Aug 19), demand reached 151 units, continuing the strong performance observed throughout August (P26: 136, P27: 109, P28: 151). The mean demand over the last four periods (P25-P28) is approximately 119 units, reflecting a sustained high-demand phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of P23 and P24 orders exactly 4 periods later. The current on-hand inventory is 86 units, and there are 350 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in Periods 25, 26, 27, and 28). To maintain high service levels during this peak while considering the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, I will use a recent_N approach for demand and volatility, setting N=4 to capture the current active August regime (mean ~119, std ~31). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~600 units) minus pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand peak confirmed: August demand (P25-P28) averaged ~119 units/week, significantly higher than the early summer lows.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime driven by the back-to-school season (August-September). Demand over the last five periods (P25-P29) has been 80, 136, 109, 151, and 116 units, averaging 118.4 units/week. This confirms the earlier cooling trend has ended and a distinct late-summer peak is established. Lead times have remained perfectly stable at 4 periods (observed in P27, P28, and P29). Since Period 30 is September 2nd, we expect this high demand to persist or potentially start to taper slightly towards the end of the month, but for now, we must protect against stockouts given the 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand mean (118.4) and volatility for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=5 covers the start of August to the present, perfectly capturing the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime stable at ~118 units/week (P25-P29). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand back-to-school/fall regime. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), demand has averaged 116.5 units/week. While P30 demand (107) was slightly lower than the August peak, it remains significantly elevated compared to the early summer lows. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (31), but there is a substantial pipeline of 506 units (including an expected arrival of 76 units in P31 from the P27 order). To maintain the current service level for this high-demand period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture this sustained high-demand regime while filtering out the earlier low-demand summer data. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as historical performance consistently matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Fall demand regime sustained: Mean demand from P25-P30 (late Aug to early Sep) is ~117 units/week. Lead time remains reliable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The SKU (Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime associated with the back-to-school and fall season. Over the last 7 periods (P25-P31), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 116 units/week (80, 136, 109, 151, 116, 107, 112). Period 31 ended with 0 on-hand inventory due to a slight stockout (demand 112, sold 107), confirming that demand remains robust. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods (observed for arrivals in P27, P28, P29, P30, and P31). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this current stable high-demand window, which ensures the base stock calculation reflects the ~116 units/week mean and its associated volatility. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 matches the actual data perfectly.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Fall demand regime remains stable at ~116 units/week (P25-P31). Lead time consistent at 4 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019, positioned in the middle of the Fall/Back-to-School season for denim. Demand has been highly consistent since Period 25 (late August), with a mean of ~116 units per week and relatively low variance compared to the spring peak. Period 32 demand was 103, following the stable trend. On-hand inventory is very low (3 units), but the in-transit pipeline is substantial (516 units). Lead times have remained perfectly stable at 4 periods since the start of the summer surge. I will continue using the high-demand regime from the last 8 periods (N=8, covering P25-P32) to parameterize the OR engine, ensuring we maintain a high service level for this consistent seasonal demand while accounting for the reliable 4-period lead time.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October (Period 34), maintaining a stable high-demand regime characterized as 'Back-to-school/Fall'. Demand over the last 9 periods (P25-P33) has averaged approximately 118 units/week (118.67), with the most recent demand spike reaching 147 units. The Lead Time (L) remains consistent at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P27-P33). Inventory is currently low (on-hand 27) with a significant pipeline (438) and expected arrivals. Given the stable demand mean over the last 9 periods, I will use recent_N with N=9 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current regime. This period's decision aims to maintain enough stock to satisfy the current 115-120 units/week demand while accounting for recent variability (sigma).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Ladies Denim) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime, which started in late July (Period 22) and has continued through September. This aligns with typical back-to-school and autumn denim demand. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the mean demand has been approximately 115.5 units per week, with a recent 4-week mean (P31-P34) of 112.25 units. While Period 34 saw a slight dip to 87 units, Period 33 was high at 147 units, suggesting continued volatility within the high-demand state rather than a cooling trend. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 93 and a logic that targets covering (L+1) periods, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average to capture this stable autumn regime while smoothing out the week-to-week volatility. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the same N=10 to reflect current market variance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime sustained: Mean demand from P25-P34 (late August through September) is approximately 116 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. We are in a stable Autumn demand regime for this denim SKU. Since Period 25 (late August), the mean demand has hovered around 114 units per week, with a slight cooling observed in the last two periods (87 and 82 units). This cooling may indicate a transition from the back-to-school peak to a mid-autumn baseline. Lead time remains consistent at exactly 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 103, and in-transit (pipeline) is 434 (orders from P32, P33, P34, P35). Total coverage is 537 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. My current position (537) divided by 5 is ~107 units/period, which aligns well with the recent high-demand mean. I will continue using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (tracking the regime desde P25) to maintain the current service levels as lead time is reliable.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in late July (Period 21/22), representing back-to-school and autumn sales for denim. While demand peaked in August/September (averaging ~116 units/week), recent demand in October (P34-P36) has moderated slightly to an average of 77 units/week (87, 82, 63). However, to avoid stockouts during this critical season, I will use a recent_N window of 12 periods (P25-P36) for demand to capture the full autumn regime while acknowledging the slight cooling in the last three weeks. This window (N=12) yields a mean of approximately 107 units/week. Lead time remains stable and reliable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 140 with 403 units in-transit, which is sufficient but requires continuous replenishment to maintain the service level across the (L+1) horizon.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' is in a high-demand autumn regime, though recent demand has slightly softened from the September peak (~116 units/week) to a mean of approximately 77 units/week over the last three periods (P35-P37: 82, 63, 81). This suggests a possible transition into a late-autumn stabilization phase. On-hand inventory is 152 units with 358 units in-transit. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. To balance the service level without over-stocking as the peak subsides, I am setting mu_hat using a recent window of 13 periods (from P25 when the late-summer surge began) to capture the broad high-season average (~109 units/week) while acknowledging the recent slight drop. This provides a stable base for the OR engine's base-stock calculation during the current (L+1) = 5 period outlook.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling from autumn peak: Mean demand has shifted from ~116 units/week (Sep) to ~77 units/week in late October (P35-P37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Historical data and recent trends show a cooling demand regime after the autumn peak. Demand in October (P35-P38) averaged ~74.5 units per week (82, 63, 81, 72), confirming the cooling trend noted in the carry-over insights. Total inventory (on-hand 236 + in-transit 272 = 508) is high relative to this recent demand mean (~75 units/week) and the promised lead time (4 periods). At a mean of 75, a total inventory of 508 covers approximately 6.7 periods, which exceeds the required coverage of (L+1) = 5 periods. The lead time remains consistently 4 weeks based on all recent arrivals. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-autumn stabilization and prevent over-ordering as we move deeper into November.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: October mean demand (P35-P38) stabilized at ~75 units/week, down from September's ~116 units/week.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens denim) is exiting its autumn high-demand phase. Demand has cooled from a September mean of ~116 units/week to a November mean of approximately 50-60 units/week. Specifically, demand in Period 39 was 46 units, following a trend of 82, 63, 81, and 72 in the preceding weeks. Given the date (Nov 11) and the product type (ankle-length denim), we are likely entering a lower winter demand regime before any potential holiday or spring uptick. Current on-hand inventory is 275 units, and in-transit is 187 units (orders from P36-P38). The pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the projected demand for the next (L+1=5) weeks at the current rate of ~55 units/week. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) to reflect the cooling trend and avoid overstocking during the winter months.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed: November demand (P39) dropped to 46 units, following a late-October stabilization at ~75 units. The new mean for institutionalizing is ~60 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand is in a confirmed cooling phase following the autumn peak. Over the last three periods (P38-P40), demand has been 72, 46, and 38 units, averaging 52 units/week. This aligns with the seasonal transition out of the high-demand back-to-school/fall period for denim. Inventory levels are currently high with 306 units on-hand and 118 in-transit (orders from P37 and P38), which is sufficient to cover approximately 8 weeks of current demand. Lead time remains stable and reliable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the lower demand, mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted using recent_N=5 (late Oct/Nov) to capture the cooling regime and prevent further overstocking while maintaining a buffer for potential late-year demand shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: November demand (P39-P40) dropped to ~40 units/week, following a late-October stabilization at ~75 units. The current regime mean is approximately 50 units/week.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Demand has consistently declined and stabilized at a lower regime following the autumn peak. Over the last three periods (P39-P41), demand has been 46, 38, and 37 units respectively, averaging ~40 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 317 units, and 70 units ordered in P38 are expected to arrive in P42 (this period). Total inventory position (317 on-hand + 70 in-transit = 387) is very high compared to the current demand regime. With only 6 periods remaining in the game (ending at Period 47) and a lead time of 4 periods, any new order placed now would not arrive until Period 46, leaving only one period of sales potential before the game ends. Given the substantial current surplus which alone covers over 9 weeks of demand at the current rate (387 / 40 \u2248 9.6 weeks), I am setting the parameters to prevent further ordering, minimizing holding costs for the remainder of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at low late-autumn/winter levels: Mean demand for P39-P41 is ~40 units/week, down from late October mean of ~75 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019. Demand in Period 42 showed a sharp increase to 85 units, interrupting the cooling trend (avg ~40 units/week) observed in Periods 39-41. This jump likely reflects Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional activities. However, historical data from early 2019 suggests that after December peaks, demand typically returns to a lower baseline before the spring refresh. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 302 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we are ordering for arrivals in early January. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the mix of the late-November spike and the preceding stabilization, effectively forecasting a mean of ~51.5 units/week ((46+38+37+85)/4). This avoids over-reacting to the single promotional spike while maintaining sufficient buffer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 85 units in P42 (late Nov) likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday; the previous Nov mean was ~40 units. Current 4-period mean is ~52 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We are in a post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand phase for these skinny jeans. Recent demand (P43) was 47 units, which is consistent with the late-autumn/winter stabilization observed (approx. 40-50 units/week), excluding the holiday spike in P42 (85 units). On-hand inventory is 255 units, and there are no units in-transit (pipeline inventory). Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, a base stock calculation needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With a current regime mean of approximately 50 units/week, the required inventory to cover the pipeline is 5 * 50 = 250 units. Because we currently have 255 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, the OR backend's base stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) will likely result in an order of 0 or a very small amount. This is appropriate as we have sufficient stock for the next 5 periods given the low winter demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand trend while including the holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stabilized in the low-demand winter regime (~40-50 units/week) following the late-November spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019/12/16). Demand has stabilized into a low-winter regime after the Black Friday spike (P42), with recent consumption averaging approximately 37 units/week (P43: 47, P44: 29). The 'On-hand' inventory of 226 units combined with 36 units 'In-transit' provides over 7 weeks of coverage for this low-demand phase. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P42 arrival from P38 order). We will continue using a recent_N strategy (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-holiday cooling trend while maintaining the default lead time.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a low-demand winter regime following the end-of-year peaks. Demand for the last three periods (P43-P45) was 47, 29, and 26 units, averaging ~34 units/week. This is consistent with the post-holiday cooling trend observed in the jeans category. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P38 order arrived in P42). On-hand inventory is healthy at 200 units, with 69 units in-transit (ordered P44 and P45). Given the current mean demand of ~35 units/week and a lead time of 4, the target base stock (L+1 periods) is approximately 175 units. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the stabilization from November through December, which filters out the isolated Black Friday spike (P42) while reflecting current consumption levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization in winter regime (Dec) confirmed: Mean demand averaged ~34 units/week over P43-P45, down from the late-autumn average of ~50-60 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-30. Demand for this SKU (Ankle-length jeans) has entered a stable low-demand winter regime after the late-November (Black Friday) spike. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) is 28.75 units/week, significantly lower than the autumn peak and the November transition period. Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 187), and given the lead time of 4 periods, new orders placed now will arrive in February 2019, which historically saw a significant demand increase (~150+ units/week in late Feb). However, current holding costs are high relative to the low demand. I am utilizing 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current winter low (N=4), while relying on the backend to manage the transition. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime confirmed: December demand (P43-P46) has averaged ~29 units/week, down from the November average of ~50 units.
