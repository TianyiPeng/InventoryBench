Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (46, 37, 48, 57, 57) show an average of 49.0 units. Recently, demand has trended upwards toward the high 50s. The product is 'Ozzy Denim Shorts' (High-waisted superstretch twill). Given the date (Feb 11), we are approaching the spring season when demand for shorts typically begins to rise in many major markets. \n3. OR Baseline: The OR recommendation is 63 units, based on a critical fractile calculated from Profit ($19) and Holding Cost ($1). This targets a high service level (~95%). \n4. Strategy: Since current inventory is zero and there is clear upward momentum in demand, I will follow the OR recommendation of 63.

There is a clear increasing demand regime as we move towards spring/summer, which aligns with the product being 'Ozzy Denim Shorts'. 3.

OR Review: The OR recommendation is 89 units. This is likely too low because the OR algorithm averages all history (including the lower Jan samples) and applies a cap. Given we are in the early spring ramp-up for shorts, we need a higher base-stock. 5. Strategy: Target a stock level for the current period's demand of approximately 150 units to avoid the stockouts seen in P1 and P2.

Period 4 saw a drop to 68, but looking at the calendar (March 11), we are entering peak spring shopping. The average demand since Period 1 is ~100. 4. OR Review: The OR recommendation is 49 units, which is heavily weighted by the low January demand samples (37-57) and doesn't fully account for the seasonal shift in denim shorts. 5. Strategy: I will target a base stock level of approximately 140 units to cover potential demand spikes as the weather warms. With 82 on hand, I need an order of 58 units.

OR Recommendation Review: The OR baseline suggests 44 units. This is based on a distribution that includes those recent lower demand values and the earlier spikes. \n5. Strategic Adjustment: With demand softening to the mid-60s, a total availability (on-hand + order) of roughly 120-130 units is prudent. Starting with 83 on-hand and ordering 44 gives 127 total units.

Current on-hand inventory is 24 units, which actually covers more than the expected demand for the upcoming period based on this average. The OR algorithm's high recommendation likely stems from its lack of recency weighting, factoring in the massive summer demand peaks (up to 812 units) into its calculations.
