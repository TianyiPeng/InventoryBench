In northern hemisphere retail, this marks the beginning of the 'Spring/Summer' transition where demand for shorts typically begins to rise as customers prepare for warmer weather. Historical Demand: Recent samples show 46, 37, 48, 57, 57. The last two weeks (late Jan/early Feb) showed an increase to 57 units, suggesting a slight upward trend. Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period and be available for this period's demand. Inventory: On-hand is 0. Forecasting: Based on the recent average of 57 and the seasonal expectation of rising demand for shorts in February, I estimate demand for Period 1 will be approximately 60-65 units. Inventory Logic: Since lead time is 0, I need to order enough to cover Period 1 demand plus a small buffer for Period 2, as I have no stock on hand.

Demand in the most recent period (P30) was only 31 units, confirming the end-of-season trajectory. In P29 demand was 86. Across P27-P30, demand has averaged ~60 units and is trending downward. On-hand inventory is currently 54 units. Given the seasonality, demand is likely to remain low or continue decreasing into the fall. With 54 units on hand, I already have enough stock to likely cover Period 31 demand (estimated at 30-40 units) plus a small safety buffer.
