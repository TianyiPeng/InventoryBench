Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie thongs). The historical demand data shows a clear declining trend from a peak of 307 units on 2019-01-21 down to 122 units on 2019-02-04. The current inventory is zero. Since we are in mid-February, we might see a slight post-Valentine's Day stabilization or further decline into a normal baseline. Given the strong downward trend in the last 5 samples (267, 298, 307, 189, 122), 'default' averaging would significantly overestimate current demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent regime shift (the drop below 200). For lead time, I will use 'default' (0 periods). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a service level target (critical ratio) of 0.50, which the OR backend will use to minimize costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the observed lead time was 0 periods (ordered and arrived in P1). Demand was 159, which is slightly higher than the most recent sample of 122 but aligns with the general range of 100-300 units seen in the history. There are 47 units on-hand. With a promised lead time of 0 (L=0), the target stock should cover the current period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand levels (189, 122, 159), averaging 156.67. This leads to a mu_hat of ~157 for (1+L) periods. For sigma_hat, I'll also use recent_N=3 to account for the recent volatility. This conservative approach balances the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0), as the OR backend's service level target q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 suggests holding roughly the median demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's lingerie thong set. Demand in Period 1 was 159, and in Period 2 it spiked to 373, leading to a stockout (sold 157, ending inventory 0). The spike in Period 2 (mid-February) likely corresponds to Valentine's Day seasonal demand for lingerie. Historical samples (Jan 7-Feb 4) showed an average demand of ~236. The recent spike to 373 is a significant deviation. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent historical samples (122) and the two active game periods (159, 373), which averages to ~218 per period. Given the L=0 lead time, the OR backend will calculate base stock using (1+0)*mean. This prevents over-reacting to the stockout while acknowledging the higher demand volatility seen in the last period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased variance seen in Period 2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) is currently experiencing high demand relative to initial forecasts, leading to stockouts in Period 2 and 3. The historical samples (mean ~236) are significantly lower than recent observed demand (373 in P2, 301 in P3), suggesting a regime shift or seasonal peak. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To recover from stockouts and better capture this higher demand regime, I will use an explicit forecast. Forecast calculation: Lead time (0) + 1 review period = 1 period of demand. Recent demand average (P2-P3) is ~337. Given the stockout constraints (sold units capped by available stock in P2/P3), actual demand was likely higher. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 350 to account for lost sales. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 100 to handle the observed high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 2: Average demand increased from historical ~236 to >337 (+40%+), likely driven by seasonal trends in cotton lingerie.

Daily Reward (R_t): $206.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is cotton jersey thongs, which appears to have entered a higher demand regime starting in mid-February (Period 2), averaging 317 units over the last 3 periods (373, 301, 278) compared to the pre-period historical average of ~200. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time consistently at 0. Currently, we have 72 units on-hand. With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the OR engine target service level is 50%, but the backend capping mechanism and volatility necessitate a robust mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand levels (last 3 periods) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the seasonality shift observed in the 'Carry-over insights'. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this new regime (avg 317) while excluding the low initial Period 1. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to capture current volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019/3/18). Looking at the SKU (Cotton Thong 3-pack), we saw an initial surge in demand during Period 2 and 3 (373, 301) which has since moderated but remains higher than the initial pre-game samples. Specifically, demand for the last three periods (P3-P5) has stabilized at an average of roughly 276 units (301, 278, 250). The 'carry_over_insight' from Period 4 correctly identified the regime shift, but the specific 'mu' estimate of >337 was slightly high based on the most recent two weeks of normalization. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-surge demand level and account for the observed volatility (Std Dev ~25). This ensures the base stock reflects current consumption rates rather than the early-February peak or the January lows.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-initial surge (P2-P3) has stabilized at a new baseline of ~276 units/period (P3-P5). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Demand history shows a volatile start: P1 (159), P2 (373 - partially lost sales), P3 (301 - partially lost sales), followed by a stabilization: P4 (278), P5 (250), P6 (216). While the carry-over insight noted a stabilization at ~276, the last three periods show a downward trend (278 -> 250 -> 216). This suggests the initial early-spring surge is cooling or settling into a lower baseline. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since Period 2 and 3 had significant lost sales (starting inventory was less than demand), the actual demand was likely higher than sales, but recent periods (P4-P6) show full fulfillment. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (P3-P6) to capture the higher baseline while acknowledging the recent dip. For sigma, N=4 is also appropriate to account for the volatility seen since the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand shows a cooling trend from the early March peak, moving from ~278 in P4 to 216 in P6.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (cotton lingerie thongs) is moving past its early-spring peak. Demand over the last 4 periods (P4-P7) has been 278, 250, 216, and 253, averaging 249.25. The most recent period (P7) saw a slight uptick back to 253, but the overall trend from February highs (~373) has cooled. Lead time remains stable at 0. On-hand inventory is very low (9 units). With Profit and Holding cost both at $1.0, the OR engine will target a 50% service level (z=0) unless parameters are adjusted. To prevent stockouts during this stabilized phase, I will use recent_N=4 to set mu_hat, reflecting the post-peak demand baseline (~250), and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized into a post-peak regime (P4-P7) with an average of ~250 units/period, down from the February volatile peak (~337+).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-08 (Period 9). The SKU (cotton jersey thong) is a staple item. Looking at the demand history since the post-peak stabilization (Period 4 onwards), the demand values have been 278, 250, 216, 253, and 283. This gives an average of 256 units per period. I am currently out of stock (ending inventory 0 in Period 8) and have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit at the start of Period 9. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. To set parameters for Period 9, I will use a recent_N approach. For mu_hat, N=5 (Periods 4-8) captures the current stable regime (mean ~256). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to capture the moderate volatility of this regime (std dev ~26.7). Since lead time is consistently 0, the OR backend logic (base_stock = (1+L)*mu + z*sqrt(1+L)*sigma) with L=0 will effectively target a stock level roughly equal to the mean plus a safety margin for one period of demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Period 4-8) indicates stabilization at approximately 256 units/period with moderate volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-04-15. Reviewing the recent demand history (Period 4-9), demand has stabilized following the February/early March peaks. The demand samples since then are: 278, 250, 216, 253, 283, 176. The average of these last 6 periods is approximately 242.6 units. The most recent demand (P9) was significantly lower (176), continuing a volatile but generally downward trend as we move away from the early spring peak in cotton lingerie. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent cooling while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (Standard Deviation of the last 6 periods is ~39), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this post-peak regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P4-P9): Average demand has settled at approximately 243 units/period, down from the February volatile peak (~337+), with a standard deviation of ~39.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period 11 (Date: 2019/4/22) confirms a descending trend and stabilization at a lower level compared to the February/early-March peak. Demand over the last two periods (P9: 176, P10: 169) is significantly lower than the P4-P8 average. I will use a window of the last 3 periods (P8-P10: 283, 176, 169) to calculate parameters, as this captures the recent cooling trend while still accounting for the possibility of moderate volatility. This results in an average demand of approximately 209 units. Setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the model to react to this lower demand regime more quickly than the full history would. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, which I will continue to use. On-hand inventory is 74, and since L=0, the backend will target the base stock calculated from these parameters and order the difference.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime identified starting Period 9: Average demand has transitioned from ~250 units to ~172 units/period (based on P9-P10), indicating a significant post-peak cooling trend.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (cotton thong 3-pack) has entered a stable, post-peak demand regime. Since Period 9 (early to late April), demand has remained consistently lower than the February/March season, with values of 176, 169, and 176. This confirms a clear regime shift where the mean has settled around 174 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=3 (the last 3 periods: P9, P10, P11) to capture this current baseline (~174 per period, or 348 for the 1+L window). This prevents the inventory system from holding excess stock based on the older March peaks. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to reflect the current reduced volatility in this stable regime. Profits and holding costs are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level is 50%, aiming for a lean inventory that minimizes holding costs while covering mean expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower baseline starting Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~250 to ~174 units/period (approx. -30%) following the end of the early spring peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 witnessed a significant demand spike (323 units), which is nearly double the average of the recently established low-demand regime (Periods 9-11 avg: ~174). This spike occurred on 2019/04/29, which likely corresponds to a late spring shopping peak or a specific promotion. Because the demand jumped so abruptly from a stable low period, I need to adjust mu_hat to account for this return of volatility, while remaining cautious about over-stocking if this was just a one-week outlier. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the shift from the low regime (P9-P11) and the sudden P12 surge. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the backend's base-stock formula will naturally target. The 'explicit' sigma_hat is set to reflect the increased standard deviation observed over these 4 periods to protect against the high variance seen in P12.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility returned in Period 12: After a stable low-demand regime (P9-11 avg ~174), demand spiked to 323 units (+85%), suggesting seasonal instability or promotional impact.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, there was a significant, likely anomalous, demand spike to 323 units, followed by a sharp drop to 122 units in Period 13. This high volatility (Coefficient of Variation > 50% in the last few periods) suggests we shouldn't rely on long-term averages. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the 'Underwear bottom | Women's Lingerie' category and the late spring date (May 13), demand is oscillating but currently trending lower after the Period 12 spike. To balance the risk of stockouts during volatility against the $1.00 holding cost, I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand mean to capture the recent high/low swings, while calculating sigma over a slightly longer window (N=8) to ensure the safety stock accounts for the high volatility observed between Period 8 and 13. This approach targets a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand while buffering for sudden swings like those seen in P12.

Carry-over insight: High demand volatility detected (P12 spike vs P13 trough): Demand range [122, 323]. Volatility makes recent short-term tracking more critical than long-term historical averages.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' (464297007) has entered a period of high volatility following the end of the early spring peak. Period 12 saw a significant spike (323), followed by a steep drop in Period 13 (122) and a moderate recovery in Period 14 (151). The current date is late May (2019/5/20), which is post-Easter and moving into early summer; however, demand has clearly cooled relative to the Feb/March levels. Given the recent erratic behavior (swinging from 122 to 323), I will prioritize more recent data while balancing the standard deviation to ensure the service level is maintained despite the volatility. I will use N=6 for mu_hat to capture the transition from the peak to the current erratic but lower-average regime (P9-P14 average ~185). Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 based on all historical concludes. I'll use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat as well to account for the heightened volatility observed specifically in the last 6 weeks.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/27. Analyzing the most recent demand history (P13-P15), demand has stabilized somewhat following the wild volatility of P12 (323 units) and P13 (122 units). The last three observations are 122, 151, and 171, showing a gentle upward trend but remaining significantly lower than the early spring peak. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially equal to the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (1+L). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods since the start. To capture the recent stabilization while acknowledging the slight upward trend, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and standard deviation. This focuses on the context of late May, moving away from the extreme outlier in P12. Pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is low at 16 units, so a replenishment is necessary.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level following P12 outlier: Period 13-15 average demand is ~148 units/period, significantly lower than the historical spring average.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we saw a demand of 200 units, which actually resulted in a stockout (we only sold 148 due to zero starting and ending inventory being observed despite an order of 132 arriving). Looking at the recent regime (Period 13-16), demand has been 122, 151, 171, and 200, which shows a clear upward trend. The average over these last 4 periods is 161. However, given the sequence is increasing (122 -> 151 -> 171 -> 200), using a slightly shorter window (N=3) captures the recent upward momentum (avg 174) better than a longer average. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since Period 16 ended with 0 inventory and there is 0 in-transit for Period 17, we need the base stock to cover the full expected demand for Period 17 immediately. I will use N=3 for mu_hat to react to the strengthening demand and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand is showing a steady recovery/upward trend over the last 4 periods (P13: 122 to P16: 200), exiting the previous low-demand regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '464297007' is a thong-style cotton lingerie item. Since Period 13, demand has shown a gradual recovery trend (P13: 122, P14: 151, P15: 171, P16: 200) followed by a slight dip in P17 (154). The 'conclude' messages consistently show an actual lead time (L) of 0 periods, allowing same-period arrival to satisfy demand. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), the average demand is 159.6 units with significant fluctuations. Given the recent variability and the upward trend observed before the P17 dip, I will use a five-period window (recent_N=5) to capture the current demand level. This balances the recent recovery against the most recent lower observation. Lead time is set to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' (Product 464297007) is showing high volatility recently, with Period 18 seeing a spike to 281 units following a more moderate Period 17 (154 units) and a stockout in Period 16 (demand 200 units). The product, being basic cotton thong briefs, likely sees demand fluctuations driven by local weather or replenishment shopping patterns. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given that the profit of $1.0 matches the holding cost of $1.0, the OR backend's service level target (q = profit / (profit + holding_cost)) will be 0.5, essentially targeting the median demand to minimize total risk. To capture the recent volatile shifts better while accounting for the recent high-demand outlier in Period 18, I will use a short window (N=4) for mu_hat (averaging Period 15-18: 171, 200, 154, 281 = ~201.5) and a slightly longer window for volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the backend accounts for the observed swings. Since we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit at the start of Period 19, the base_stock calculation will drive the full order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in Period 18: Demand spiked to 281 units (75%+ above recent avg), confirming a pattern of sharp, non-seasonal fluctuations in the Q2 period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/06/24). The inventory for SKU 464297007 is currently 0, following a massive demand spike of 556 units in Period 19. This is the highest demand recorded to date, significantly exceeding the previous spike of 373 in Period 2. The carry-over insights correctly identified a upward trend/volatility in Q2, but the magnitude of the Midsummer/June-end surge was underestimated. Given the product (cotton thongs), we are likely seeing a peak summer demand period. Recent history (P16-P19) shows demand of 200, 154, 281, and 556. The average of these 4 periods is ~298. Moving to an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat is necessary to replenish stock and cover this high-volatility regime. I will set mu_hat based on a weighted view of these recent peaks (~350 units) to avoid stockouts while acknowledging potential mean reversion. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Major demand spike in Period 19 (556 units), confirming extreme Q2 volatility and a high-summer seasonal peak for cotton lingerie. Demand regime is currently high-growth/volatile.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, demand returned to a more moderate level (261) after the extreme outlier of 556 in Period 19. The current date is July 1st. In the lingerie category, summer peaks generally occur in June, followed by a potential stabilization in July. Over the last 4 periods (P17-P20), demand has been highly volatile: 154, 281, 556, 261. The mean demand for these last 4 periods is 313. This captures the upward trend and peak while acknowledging the recent cooling. The backend base stock formula will use this mean to calculate base stock and cap. With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the service level q = 0.5 (z=0), meaning the backend target stock is simply the expected demand over the lead time (1+0) = 1. lead_time remains 0 based on consistent history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current high-volatility/summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a high-volatility summer phase (P17-P20), with an average of ~313 units/period, significantly higher than the previous spring baseline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-volatility summer period (early July) for cotton lingerie. Demand over the last five periods (P17-P21) has been 154, 281, 556, 261, and 201 units. While the massive spike in P19 (556 units) highlights significant upside potential, the last two periods (261, 201) show the market is cooling slightly but remains above the spring floor (~170). The average for the last 5 periods is ~290, but heavily skewed by P19. If we look at the last 3 periods (P19-P21), the average is ~339. Given the Profit/Holding ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (the median). However, our goal is to capture the summer volatility without overstocking as we move further into July. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the elevated summer baseline (~290/period) while accounting for the high volatility in sigma_hat to protect against another P19-style surge. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High summer demand regime confirmed (P18-P21): Average demand increased to ~325 units/period during June/July peak, with extreme single-period volatility (P19 spike to 556).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (cotton thong) is currently in a high-volatility summer demand regime (July). Recent demand (P18-P22: 281, 556, 261, 201, 341) reflects significant variability with a high average of ~328 units. Period 22 demand was 341, causing a stockout on the 291 units available. The inventory is currently at 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders in the same period they are placed. To capture the high-demand summer trend and mitigate stockout risk during this volatile peak, I will use a recent_N window for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. I am choosing N=5 to reflect the most recent summer demand behavior (P18-P22), which captures the 556 spike as well as the more recent 341 surge, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover these high-demand outcomes while accounting for the current zero-inventory position.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Greta Thong' (cotton lingerie) is currently in a high-summer seasonal peak (July). Period 23 saw a demand spike of 422 units, which follows a consistent high-volatility pattern in June and July (ranging from 201 to 556). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The actual lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high demand and the high risk of stockouts during this retail peak, I am selecting a recent_N strategy for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=5 allows the OR engine to capture the high summer mean (approx 356 units over P19-P23) and the high volatility of the current regime. This ensures the base stock is high enough to satisfy the current peak while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering if the peak subsides.

Carry-over insight: High summer demand regime intensified in July: Period 22-23 average demand is ~382 units/period, confirming a sustained peak exceeding the June average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-87.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Greta Thong' SKU shows extreme volatility in Q2 and June/July, with a notable peak in Period 23 (422 units) followed by a sharp drop in Period 24 (135 units). This suggest either the end of the summer peak or high period-to-period variance. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high volatility (sigma), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (P19-P24) to capture the recent high-volume summer regime while accounting for the recent drop. This range includes the extreme spike of 556 and the recent low of 135, providing a balanced but cautious forecast for the tail end of July/early August. L is set to default (0) as all orders have arrived on the same period they were placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme at the end of July (P23: 422 vs P24: 135); the summer peak may be transitioning into a late-summer cooling phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-54.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' (cotton lingerie) is currently exiting its high-summer peak (June/July) and entering a cooling phase in early August. In Period 24 and 25, demand dropped significantly to 135 and 133 units respectively, compared to the July average of ~380. The 'on-hand' inventory is currently 187 units, which is already enough to cover approximately one period of the current lower-demand regime. However, given the high volatility observed throughout the year (multiple spikes above 300+), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (covering Periods 22-25) to capture the transition from high to low demand (~257 units/period). This provides a buffer against any residual summer volatility while acknowledging the downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, though the backend 'cap' and my sigma_hat will help manage the risks of volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed for early August: Periods 24-25 average demand is ~134 units, a 65% drop from the July peak average of ~382.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 (cotton lace thong) is currently characterized by extreme late-summer volatility. After a significant cooling period (P24-P25 avg: 134), demand spiked again in P26 to 339 units. The product description and current date (mid-August) suggests we are exiting the peak summer season but experiencing clearing-out or final high-summer demand spikes. Given the lead time is confirmed and consistent at 0 periods, I will prioritize recent demand patterns to capture this renewed volatility. I will use N=3 to capture the transition from the low-demand trough (P24-P25) to the latest spike (P26), which averages to ~202 units per period. This acknowledges the cooling trend identified in the carry-over insights while remaining responsive to the sudden volume increase observed in the most recent period.

Carry-over insight: Renewed demand volatility in early August: Period 26 demand spiked to 339 units (+150%) after a two-week cooling trend (P24-P25 avg ~134), suggesting the late-summer cooling phase is non-linear.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P24-P27) shows significant volatility (135, 133, 339, 243) as the summer peak transitions into late August. The current date is 2019/08/19. While earlier carry-over insights suggested a cooling trend, the last two observations (avg ~291) indicate that demand remains higher than the late July lows. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (P24-P27) to capture this transitional volatility (average ~212.5). Given the standard deviation of this recent window is high (~100), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 120 to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the non-linear demand spikes observed in P26. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' (cotton lingerie) is currently in a highly volatile late-summer phase. After a significant peak in July (reaching 422 units), August demand has fluctuated wildly between 100 and 339 units. The most recent period (P28) saw a sharp drop to 100 units, leaving 113 units on-hand. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend service level target is 50%. Due to the extreme non-linear nature of recent demand (P24-P28: 135, 133, 339, 243, 100), I am using a recent_N approach for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with N=5 to capture this high-volatility regime and respond to the recent cooling without ignoring the possibility of another spike.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand volatility remains high (P24-P28 range: 100-339). The regime is non-linear, transitioning from a July peak into a volatile August/September period with an average demand of ~190 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 (cotton lingerie thong) has exited its extreme July peak and enter a volatile late-summer/early-autumn phase. Recent demand (P28: 100, P29: 124) indicates a cooling trend compared to the August spike (P26: 339). The current average demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is 187.8 units, while the last 3 periods (P27-P29) average 155.6 units. Given the non-linear volatility observed throughout August, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the immediate post-peak stabilization while providing a buffer for the observed high-variance spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0. Setting mu_hat to cover 188 units and using recent_N for sigma_hat allows the backend to account for the high standard deviation (approx 96 units over the last 5 periods) inherent in this volatile transition period.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand transition (P25-P29) shows cooling but remains non-linearly volatile, with a 5-period average of ~188 units/period, down from the July average of ~382.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019/9/2 (Period 30) was 101, following a trend of stabilization after the summer peak. The current regime (Periods 28-30) shows demand levels of 100, 124, and 101, which is significantly lower and less volatile than the August peak (339 units in Period 26). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 87 and the recent stable demand around 108 units/period, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current post-summer stabilization. This will prevent over-ordering based on the high-volatility August data while ensuring enough stock to cover the immediate demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed (Periods 28-30): Demand has settled into a lower-volume, low-volatility regime with an average of approximately 108 units/period, down from the volatile August average of ~190.

The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for this cotton thong product. Historically, demand has cooled significantly from the July peak (~382 units) and the volatile August period (~190 units). The most recent four periods (P28-P31) show a much lower and more stable demand baseline of approximately 100 units/period (100, 124, 101, 77), with a mean of 100.5 and a standard deviation of 19.3. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the transition into mid-September, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect this lower-volume regime and avoid over-ordering based on obsolete summer data. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will calculate using these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling phase (P28-P31) confirmed: Demand has shifted to a lower, stable regime averaging ~100 units/period, down from the volatile August average of ~190.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 has entered a post-summer transition phase. While periods 28-31 showed a stable lower regime (~100 units/period), Period 32 saw a significant spike to 194 units, likely indicating pre-autumn stock needs or late-season volatility. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent spike following a period of low demand, using a short-term window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat will better capture the current upward oscillation (average of P28-P32 is approx 119) compared to longer-term averages. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to account for the increased volatility seen in the move from 77 to 194 units. This approach helps the OR engine calculate a base stock that covers the immediate demand spike while being lean to avoid high holding costs if the trend doesn't persist.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling phase (P28-P31) was interrupted in Period 32 by a demand spike to 194 units (+150% over P31), suggesting non-linear volatility in the autumn transition.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (cotton thong) has entered an extreme demand phase in Period 33, with demand spiking to 692 units, which is over 350% higher than the previous period's surge. This confirms that the autumn transition noted in the Carry-over insights is highly volatile. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the massive stockout. Given the 'cotton thong' product type, this could be driven by a late-September promotion or a seasonal clearance event. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the average of the last two volatile periods (P32: 194, P33: 692), resulting in a mean of 443 units per period. This aggressive forecast is necessary to capture the current high-demand regime and prevent further stockouts. sigma_hat will also be set explicitly to reflect the extreme volatility (350+ units). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand surge confirmed in late September (Period 33): Demand reached 692 units, a 250%+ increase over the previous surge (Period 32), marking a high-volatility regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (cotton thong) has entered an extremely volatile high-demand regime in late September/early October. Period 33 saw a massive spike to 692 units, followed by 335 units in Period 34. This likely represents a major autumn promotional event or early Q4 seasonal shift. The previous 'post-summer cooling' regime is no longer relevant. With a Profit/Holding cost ratio of 1.0, the OR backend targets a 50% service level. Given the extreme variance (692 and 335 in the last two weeks), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the impact of this surge while calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat. Period 32 (194 units) also showed an upward trend compared to the ~100 unit baseline, making N=3 (Periods 32-34) the most accurate window for the current high-volatility regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand/high-volatility regime confirmed in late September (P33-P34): Average demand spiked to ~513 units/period, driven by a peak of 692 units. This supersedes the previous post-summer low-demand regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (cotton thong) is currently in a state of extreme late-September/early-October volatility. After a massive demand spike in Period 33 (692 units), demand has softened significantly over the following two periods (P34: 335, P35: 123). Historically, this item exhibits sharp peaks followed by rapid cooling. We are currently in a high-demand regime relative to the stable post-summer lows, but the immediate trend is a sharp decline. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P33-P35) to capture this new regime's average (~383 units) rather than the long-term historical average, while maintaining high volatility (sigma_hat) to protect against another sudden spike. The lead time remains consistently 0. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 284 units.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike cooling detected: Demand dropped from 692 (P33) to 123 (P35), indicating a rapid deceleration after the late-September peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 (cotton jersey thong) has exited the extreme late-September/early-October surge (P33-P34 peak of 692/335) and is now stabilizing at a lower post-peak level. Period 35 demand was 123 and Period 36 demand was 100. The carry-over insights confirm this cooling trend. On-hand inventory is currently high at 284 units due to previous orders based on the spike. Given the product is basic cotton lingerie, extreme pulses are likely promotional or seasonal, followed by lower baseline demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this new, lower regime (approx. 100-120 units) while ignoring the long-term historical average which is skewed by summer and autumn peaks. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the current lower volatility relative to the massive September spike. Lead time remains consistently at 0 based on all historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling confirmed (P35-P36): Demand has dropped from a peak of 692 to a stable baseline of ~112 units/period (average of P35-P36). Sustained reduction in volatility compared to September.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Greta Thong Mynta (SKU 464297007) has transitioned into a stable post-peak regime. Following the extreme surge in late September (P33-P34), demand has sharply cooled and stabilized over the last three periods (P35-P37) with values of 123, 100, and 124. This confirms the 'post-peak cooling' insight. Current on-hand inventory is 160 units, which is already sufficient to cover the current average demand (~115 units/period) plus a safety buffer, given the lead time L=0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=3 (P35-P37) to capture this lower, stable baseline and prevent over-ordering based on the September outlier. Since Lead Time = 0, the order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November. Historically, demand for this cotton thong SKU has stabilized following the extreme late-September volatility (P33-P34). Over the last four periods (P35-P38), demand has been exceptionally stable, ranging between 100-124 units (Average: 115.5). This represents a clear post-peak cooling regime. Lead time consistency is high at 0 periods. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (the median of the distribution). The current on-hand inventory is 45 units, which is below the current weekly average requirement. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this stable, lower-demand regime while ignoring the September outliers, ensuring the model orders enough to meet the 115-unit baseline without overstocking as we approach the end of the game.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed (P35-P38): Demand has settled into a low-volatility regime averaging ~116 units/period, down from the volatile September peak (~513 units/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (early November), demand spiked to 241 units, breaking the previous low-volatility post-peak regime which averaged ~116 units (Periods 35-38). This suggests the beginning of a seasonal uptick, likely associated with mid-November or early pre-holiday shopping for 'Womens Lingerie'. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Given the move from ~116 to 241, I will shift the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this new level. Using recent_N with N=3 captures the transition from the stable baseline into this spike. Since lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, I will maintain method 'default'. Volatility has also increased with this spike, so sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=5 to capture the recent regime shift without being overly skewed by the single massive spike in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 39 (241 units), indicating a departure from the October low-volume regime (~116 units) and the potential start of a pre-holiday seasonal trend.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019). The demand for cotton thongs (464297007) has historically shown extreme volatility with sharp peaks followed by cooling. We are currently observing a significant pre-holiday surge: Period 39 was 241 units and Period 40 spiked to 387 units. Historically, late November transitions into Black Friday and pre-Christmas shopping, which often correlates with spikes in basics like cotton underwear. The current regime (P39-P40) average is ~314 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the stockout in P40 and the upcoming likely high-demand window, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P38-P40) which captures the transition from low volume to the current surge, and sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the high volatility observed in the recent shift. This should ensure a base stock high enough to capture the momentum of the current spike while the OR backend balances the 1:1 profit-to-holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge confirmed starting mid-November (Period 39): Demand increased from an October baseline of ~116 to 314 units/period (avg P39-P40), marking the start of the pre-holiday seasonal trend.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (cotton thong) is currently in a pre-holiday seasonal surge. Demand in Period 41 was 348 units, following 387 in Period 40 and 241 in Period 39. This confirms a sustained regime shift (average of last 3 periods \u2248 325) compared to the October baseline of ~116. As of Period 42 (Nov 25), we are entering the peak holiday shopping weeks (Black Friday/Cyber Monday), where demand for basic lingerie often spikes. Given the stockout in P41 (on-hand 0, in-transit 0), an aggressive base stock is needed to satisfy current demand and prevent further lost sales. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this holiday surge (mu_hat \u2248 650 for L+1=2 periods, though backend calculates per period). Expected lead time remains 0 based on consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Holiday seasonal surge confirmed starting Period 39: Average demand increased to ~325 units/period (P39-P41), a ~180% increase over the October baseline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019/12/02 (Period 43). We are in the thick of the holiday seasonal surge. Reviewing recent demand (P39-P42): 241, 387, 348, 311. This confirms a sustained regime shift with an average of approximately 322 units/period. The carry-over insight from Period 42 correctly identified this surge (+180% over October). Given we are entering December, the peak holiday shopping month, I expect demand to remain at this elevated level or potentially increase further before cooling post-Christmas. To provide enough stock for the current period (since L=0 and arrival happens after the decision), I will use the recent 4-period mean to set the base stock level. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the backend will use in its quantile calculation. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the seasonal regime while ignoring the previous low-demand October data.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak sustained through late November: Periods 39-42 average demand is ~322 units/period, confirming the pre-holiday surge has reached a stable high-volume plateau.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 9th, which is squarely within the peak holiday shopping window. Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift starting in Period 39 (mid-November), where demand jumped from an October baseline of ~116 to a high-volume plateau averaging ~311 units over the last five periods (P39-P43: 241, 387, 348, 311, 266). While the Period 43 demand of 266 shows a slight softening from the absolute peak of 387, the upcoming weeks leading to Christmas typically maintain high traffic for lingerie/apparel. Therefore, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture this sustained holiday regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Establishing mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this 5-period window (P39-P43) ensures the base stock reflects current high demand and associated holiday volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the December holiday shopping season (Period 45, Dec 16). Historical data for this thong SKU shows a sustained holiday surge beginning in mid-November (Period 39), with average demand over the last 6 periods (P39-P44) being approximately 322 units/period. The most recent demand was 380, indicating the peak is still active. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we target the median. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current holiday regime (starting from Period 39) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the increased volume and volatility of the seasonal peak better than a long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak sustained through mid-December: Periods 39-44 average demand is ~322 units/period with high volatility (range 241-387).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/23. Based on the product category (womens lingerie/cotton thongs), we are in the peak holiday season. Historical data shows a sustained period of high demand starting around Period 39 (early November), with demand consistently exceeding 300 units in 5 out of the last 6 periods. The most recent demand (P45) was 360 units, and previous weeks (P44, P41, P40) were also in the 340-387 range. Given the high stockout frequency in recent periods (P44 and P45 both ended with 0 inventory despite arrivals), I am focusing on the most recent 7-period 'holiday' regime (P39-P45) to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. The average demand during this regime is approximately 327. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To minimize lost sales during this peak week (Christmas week), I will use the recent 7-period statistics to project demand and volatility, ensuring base stock levels are responsive to the current high-velocity environment.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 30th (Period 47), representing the immediate post-Christmas and end-of-year clearance phase. Historical data shows that demand has been in a sustained high-volume holiday peak since Period 39 (approx. late October/early November), with demand consistently ranging between 311 and 387 units. Over the last three periods (P44-P46), demand has been very stable around the 360-unit mark (380, 360, 358). While historical trends suggest a potential cooling after the holiday peak (similar to the post-summer drop), the current momentum remains high. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. To handle the current high-demand regime while remaining responsive to a potential post-holiday drop-off, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' where N=8, capturing the entire pre-holiday/holiday surge starting at Period 39. This provides a robust mean (approx. 331 units) that reflects current volume without over-indexing on a single outlier. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the volatility associated with this holiday regime.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand plateau confirmed (Period 41-46): Average demand has stabilized at ~340 units/period (range 311-387) following the initial November surge.
