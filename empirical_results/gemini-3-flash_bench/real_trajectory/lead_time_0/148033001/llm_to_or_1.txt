Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 148033001 (Women's Tights). The promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 pre-game samples (avg=50, std=8.37), the demand is relatively stable. However, the current date is the week of February 11th, which coincides with Valentine's Day. For a product like 'Semi shiny stay-ups with a wide lace trim', we expect a demand spike due to holiday seasonality. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to forecast a 20% increase over the historical average (50 * 1.2 = 60 per period) to ensure stock availability for this peak. Since L=0, mu_hat = (1+L)*60 = 60. Sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=5 to capture historical volatility (approx 8.37 * sqrt(1) = 8.37).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the historical demand (Jan-Feb), the observations are [58, 42, 40, 50, 60] plus the Period 1 demand of 58. The mean demand is approximately 51.3. For Period 1, the order of 75 arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 is currently accurate. Since this is a lingerie/hosiery item ('20 denier stay-ups'), there isn't a specific mid-February spike expected beyond general stability. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (all available samples including Period 1) to capture the base demand level while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1254.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, demand was 70, which exceeded the total available inventory (66), resulting in a stockout. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm actual lead time is 0. Demand history (58, 42, 40, 50, 60, 58, 70) shows a slight upward trend in the last two periods. To avoid further stockouts, I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent increase while acknowledging the high service level required (profit $19 vs. holding cost $1). I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they capture the recent jump to 70 and the general variation in this garment category.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 (Women's Stay-Up Tights) is currently in early March. Historical demand data from early February to late February shows a range of 40 to 70 units per week. In Period 2, we experienced a stockout (demand 70 vs 66 available), suggesting the baseline demand might be higher than the average including the most recent dip. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 4, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly increase as we move towards early spring retail patterns. Based on the five pre-game samples (avg ~48) and the three game periods (avg ~56), the overall mean is approximately 51. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering all active game periods and the most recent pre-game samples) to capture this recent variance and slightly higher demand level. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $806.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Nouvelle 1p Stay Up' (women's hosiery). The current date is March 11, 2019. Observed demand over the first 4 periods has been [58, 70, 42, 44], averaging 53.5. Historically (pre-game), demand was [58, 42, 40, 50, 60], averaging 50. There is a slight uptick in recent weeks, possibly due to seasonal transition into spring fashion. In Period 2, we experienced a stockout (sold 66 with a demand of 70) due to insufficient starting inventory/safety stock. The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by the game history (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). To avoid further stockouts, I will use recent demand history to set parameters. Since the demand is relatively stable but showed a spike in Period 2, I will use a N=5 window to capture the most recent behavior while smoothing noise. L=0 ensures we order only for the current period's forecasted demand and safety stock.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-18. The product is a pair of stay-up stockings, which often see slightly higher demand during the spring transition and around seasonal events. Historical demand samples (58, 42, 40, 50, 60) and game history demand (58, 70, 42, 44, 69) show a mean of approximately 53.3 units per period. The most recent demand (69) and Period 2 demand (70) suggest a higher volatility than the initial samples. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will set L to 'default' (0). For demand (mu_hat), use the average of the last 5 periods (58, 70, 42, 44, 69 = 56.6), and since L=0, (1+L)*56.6 = 56.6. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent moderate volatility (std dev of the last 5 periods is ~13.4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '148033001' (Womens Tights) is currently in Period 7 (March 25). Historical demand data and game history (Periods 1-6) show a noticeable upward trend in demand: 58, 70, 42, 44, 69, 100. The mean of the last 3 periods is ~71, while Period 6 spiked to 100, which resulted in a stockout (sold 79 vs demand 100). The promised lead time is 0, and consistent with history, arrivals have been occurring in the same period they were ordered (lead_time=0 confirmed). Since demand is increasing (likely spring seasonality or promotional effect) and current on-hand inventory is 0, I need to increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to prevent further stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture this recent acceleration without over-weighting the Period 6 outlier too heavily, though it remains a significant signal. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~48 in periods 1-4 to ~84 in periods 5-6 (+75%). Stockout occurred in Period 6 due to 100 units demanded.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, including the most recent shipment. A demand regime shift was noted in the previous carry-over insight starting around Period 5. Demand in Periods 5, 6, and 7 was 69, 100, and 54 respectively, averaging ~74.3 units per period (compared to the pre-shift average of ~53 in Periods 1-4). The drop to 54 in Period 7 suggests the 'spike' of 100 might have been an outlier or a brief peak, but the mean remains higher than the initial periods. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this elevated demand regime (avg ~74, resulting in a base stock target of ~148 for L=0) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed in this period. This approach ensures we maintain enough inventory to avoid the stockout seen in Period 6 while not overreacting to the single 100-unit spike now that demand has tempered slightly.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. This product (Women's Stay-Up Tights) experienced a significant demand spike in Period 6 (100 units demanded), which prompted an increase in orders. Since then, demand has stabilized at a higher level than the early periods: the mean demand for the last 4 periods (Periods 5-8) is 70.0 (69, 100, 54, 57), compared to the initial 5-sample average of 50.4. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a healthy service level given the recent volatility and the higher demand floor, I will use recent_N=4 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the shift from Period 5 onwards. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the (~70 unit) weekly demand while accounting for the recent standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is 70.0, which is 40% higher than the initial baseline (50). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a pair of semi-shiny stay-up leggings. We have observed a demand regime shift starting around Period 5. While Periods 5-8 showed a higher mean (~70), Period 9 saw a significant drop to 30. Looking at the history (P1: 58, P2: 70, P3: 42, P4: 44, P5: 69, P6: 100, P7: 54, P8: 57, P9: 30), it appears the demand is volatile but generally stabilized higher than the initial seed data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arriving in the same period). Given the recent drop in Period 9, I will use a recent_N of 5 (Periods 5-9) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. This covers the high-demand periods (69, 100, 54, 57) and the recent low period (30), which averages to 62. Since L=0, the OR backend will calculate base_stock for (1+0) = 1 period of demand. On-hand is currently 75, which is relatively high, so the resulting order will be appropriately conservative.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 (Stay-up stockings) is showing a significant decline in demand over the last 4 periods (P7-P10: 54, 57, 30, 22). This follows a previous peak and regime shift noted in Period 7. The current mean demand for the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 52.6, but the most recent two weeks average only 26. This decline aligns with the seasonal transition in mid-April (2019/04/22) for hosiery/socks as temperatures rise in the spring, reducing demand for 20 denier stay-ups. Lead time is consistently 0. I will adjust mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this downward trend (average ~40.75) and sigma_hat similarly to prevent overstocking as demand cools. Using recent_N=4 balances the high period (P7) with the recent low periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Demand is declining significantly from Spring highs (avg of last 2 periods: 26 vs previous 4-period avg: 70). Likely seasonal hosiery drop-off.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical data confirms a significant downward trend in demand starting in Period 9, with demand dropping from a peak average of ~70 (Periods 5-8) to an average of ~29 over the last three periods (30, 22, 36). This aligns with seasonal expectations for '20 denier' stay-ups as the weather warms in Spring. Carry-over insights previously flagged a drop-off, which is now sustained over three periods. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory costs as demand cools, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (average 29.3). Lead time L is set to 0. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed seasonal demand decline: Average demand dropped from ~70 (Mar/early April) to ~29 in late April (Periods 9-11). Inventory targets should now reflect this lower baseline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 20-denier stay-up stocking, which is highly seasonal. As we move into May (Period 13, 2019/5/6), demand is expected to remain lower than the March peak but has shown a slight uptick in the most recent period (Period 12 demand was 55). We are currently at zero inventory after a stockout in Period 12. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (30, 22, 36, 55), which equals approx 35.75 per period. Since L=0, the backend will target (1+0) * mu_hat. This balances the risk of further stockouts against the seasonal decline. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 14 (mid-May). Historical demand shows three distinct phases: initial baseline (P1-P4, ~54), a peak Spring/pre-Easter phase (P5-P8, ~70), and a significant decline as warmer weather arrives (P9-P11, ~29). However, demand in P12 (55) and P13 (48) suggests a stabilization or minor rebound compared to the deep April trough, although still lower than the March peak. The product is 20 denier stay-ups, which typically see lower demand as summer approaches. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the recent data points (30, 22, 36, 55, 48), the average of the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) is ~38. This captures the lower seasonal baseline while acknowledging the recent slight uptick from the April lows. I will use recent_N=5 for demand and standard calculation for lead time to maintain the 0-period expectation.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower seasonal baseline: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 38.2, confirming the end of the high Spring peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product (20 denier stay-ups) has transitioned out of its Spring peak (March-April) into a lower late-Spring demand regime. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) is 35.5 units, significantly lower than the ~70 units seen during the peak. The last period (P14) demand was very low at 22 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs at the end of the season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current lower demand level while discounting the earlier seasonal spikes. This ensures our base stock level remains lean yet responsive to the current 20-50 unit demand range.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27th, late Spring. Demand has been fluctuating throughout May, with a mean of 41 units over the last three periods (P13-P15: 48, 22, 54). This is significantly lower than the March peak of ~70 but higher than the mid-April lull of ~30. The most recent demand (P15: 54) suggests that while demand is lower than the early Spring peak, it remains moderately high. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 periods (P11-P15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the current post-peak stabilization level (mean ~43, which at L=0 results in mu_hat ~43). This N captures the shift away from the higher March demand levels while keeping pace with May volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Stay Up' stockings (20 denier) shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high Spring peak (March/April) followed by a drop in late April/May. However, the last four periods (P13-P16) show a stabilization with an average demand of 42.25 units (48, 22, 54, 45), which is higher than the late April slump but lower than the March peak. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this post-peak stabilization while remaining responsive to the moderate volatility seen recently (range 22-54), I will use recent_N with N=4. This targets the current demand regime which appears to have settled since Period 13.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization: Demand from P13-P16 has averaged 42.25 units, establishing a new early-summer baseline higher than the late April dip but well below the March peak.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a 20 denier stay-up (hosiery), which typically sees higher demand in early spring and lower, more stable demand in summer. Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization after the April decline. For the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has been: 48, 22, 54, 45, 20. The average demand during this 'post-peak' period is 37.8 units. Although there is moderate volatility (standard deviation ~15), the move towards summer suggests we should avoid overstocking. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this current early-summer demand regime (P13-P17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring our base stock target reflects the mean of ~38 units plus a safety buffer for the volatility observed in May.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product (20 denier stay-ups) has transitioned through its high Spring peak (March/early April) and a subsequent dip in late April. Demand has since stabilized into a fairly consistent early-summer pattern. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), demand has averaged 37.3 units (48, 22, 54, 45, 20, 35). The last 3 periods specifically (P16-P18) show an average of 33.3 units. Given the seasonality of stay-ups (typically lower demand in hot summer months but relatively stable for work/evening wear), I will detect a regime of N=6 to capture the post-peak stabilization while smoothing out the volatility observed in May. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory currently sits at 29 units, and with zero arrivals from previous periods expected (L=0), the OR backend will calculate an order to reach the base stock target based on the recent 6-period mean of ~37 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (20 denier stay-ups) has transitioned out of the high-demand Spring season (March/April peaks of ~70 units) into a more stable early-summer regime. Over the last 6 periods (P14-P19), demand has averaged 33.5 units (22, 54, 45, 20, 35, 25). While there is some volatility, there is no evidence of a new trend or seasonal spike approaching in late June. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order from P1 to P19. I will set L to the promised 0 and use a recent window of N=6 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable period following the seasonal drop witnessed in late April/early May. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock that covers the current demand level without overstocking on inventory as summer progresses.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Demand for this SKU (20 denier stay-ups) has shown a marked decline over the last four periods (P17-P20 being 20, 35, 25, 10), averaging 22.5 units per period. This is a significant drop from the early summer baseline of ~42 noted in Period 17, likely reflecting the peak of summer heat where hosiery demand typically hits its seasonal low. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I am shifting the mu_hat forecast to use the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this summer lull. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same recent period to reflect the current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand has entered a summer low; average demand for the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is 22.5, significantly lower than the June (P17-P18) avg of 27.5 and May baseline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, reflecting a mid-summer demand period for this hosiery SKU (20 denier stay-ups). Historical review shows demand has significantly cooled since the spring peak (March/April). In the last five periods (P17-P21), demand has been: 20, 35, 25, 10, 22, averaging 22.4 units per period. This confirms the 'summer low' noted in the Period 21 carry-over. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level, but mu_hat and sigma_hat must be adjusted to the current summer baseline to avoid excess inventory accumulation. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recent stabilized low-demand regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/15, deep in the summer season for '20 denier stay-ups', which traditionally see lower demand during warm weather. Historical demand data from early June onwards (P17-P22) has averaged 23.5 units (20, 35, 25, 10, 22, 29). The 'summer low' noted in Carry-over Insights (P21) is sustained. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods (all recent orders, including P22, arrived same-period). I will set L to 0. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current stable summer demand regime (average ~23.5), avoiding historical spring peaks. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect the lower volatility present in this summer baseline. This configuration ensures we maintain enough inventory to cover immediate demand without overstocking during the absolute low point of the hosiery season.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a 20-denier stay-up (tights/hosiery), which is seasonally weak during the peak summer months. We are currently in a low-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent demand samples: P20 (10), P21 (22), P22 (29), P23 (22). The average for the last 4 periods is 20.75, which aligns with the Summer Low insight recorded in Period 21. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 16 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level, but mu_hat and sigma_hat must be adjusted to the current 'Summer Low' regime to prevent excessive holding costs. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this stabilized low-demand period (P20-P23).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a 20 denier stay-up stocking, which is heavily seasonal and currently in its summer low. Historical demand confirms this: the average demand over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) is 21.75 units, consistent with the summer regime identified in Period 21. Lead time is consistently 0. I will continue to use a recent_N approach to focus on this summer baseline, setting N=4 to capture the most relevant recent activity. The backend OR logic will use these parameters to determine the order quantity needed to reach a base stock that balances the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost, while accounting for the 0-period lead time and the 20 units currently on hand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5 (Period 26). Demand for the SKU 'Nouvelle 1p Stay Up' (20 denier leggings/tights) has stabilized at a summer low. Over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), the average demand has been approximately 19.5 units (10, 22, 29, 22, 14, 30). This represents a consistent summer demand regime significantly lower than the spring peak (~70) and even the early summer stabilization (~40). Lead time is reliably 0 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. We currently have 2 units on-hand. Since the lead time is 0, the backend will calculate the base stock for the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this established lower summer baseline (July/August) without being biased by higher June numbers. This approach ensures high service level for the current low-demand regime while minimizing holding costs on a low-demand item.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline confirmed: Average demand from Period 20 to 25 (Late June to July) is ~19.5 units, consistently lower than the early summer average of ~42.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/8/12), representing the end of the summer season for hosiery (20 denier stay-ups). Historically, demand since July (Period 21) has stabilized at a low baseline. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P21-P26) is 23.0 units (22, 29, 22, 14, 30, 21), which aligns with the previously identified 'Summer demand baseline'. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will continue using recent_N=6 to capture this stable, low-demand summer regime while allowing for slight fluctuations (std \u2248 5.8). This ensures the base stock calculation prevents overstocking as we approach the end of the summer lull.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The product is a 20 denier stay-up, which is highly seasonal. We are currently in the mid-to-late summer period. Demand over the last 7 periods (P21-P27) has been consistently low, averaging 23.4 units, which aligns with the previously identified 'Summer demand baseline'. Most recent demand samples are 22, 29, 22, 14, 30, 21, and 26. The lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent same-period arrivals (e.g., P27 order arrived in P27). To manage the summer baseline effectively, I will use a recent_N approach for demand forecasting with N=7 to capture this stabilized low period while ignoring the higher spring/early summer spikes. This period (late August) often precedes a slight uptick as customers prepare for the transition to autumn, but until that trend manifests in the data, the conservative summer baseline is safest to avoid excess holding costs on a low-demand SKU.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The product is 20 denier stay-up hosiery, which typically sees its lowest demand during the summer months and begins to recover as autumn approaches in September. Analysis of recent demand from Period 23 to 28 (late July to late August) shows a slight upward trend in demand: 22, 14, 30, 21, 26, 30 (Average = 23.8), compared to the earlier summer baseline of ~19.5 (Periods 20-25). On-hand inventory is currently very low (3 units). Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. To prepare for the transition from late summer to early autumn, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this rising baseline of ~24 units, and use a recent N for sigma to handle the volatility seen in the 14-30 demand range. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that prevents stockouts while anticipating the seasonal shift.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand (P23-P28) showing early signs of recovery from the July low: average demand increased to 23.8 from 19.5 (+22%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand for this SKU (20 denier stay-ups/tights) typically experiences a seasonal recovery in early autumn as weather cools, following the summer low recorded in Period 26. Looking at the last 7 periods (P23-P29), demand has shifted from a July average of ~19.5 to an August/early-September average of ~24.4 (samples: 22, 14, 30, 21, 26, 30, 29). The most recent three periods (P27-P29) show even higher consistency with demands of 26, 30, and 29 (avg ~28.3). Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent upward trend (recent_N=7 to capture the recovery phase) while sigma_hat is set to the same window to capture the volatility of this transition. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been highly reliable at 0. This approach ensures we have enough stock to meet the increasing autumn demand while the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies a robust base-stock level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery confirmed: Average demand for P27-P29 increased to 28.3 units, up from the summer low of 19.5 (+45%).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the Autumn season (September), which historically shows a demand recovery for hosiery/tights after the summer low. The carry-over insights confirm that demand has stabilized at a higher baseline than the July/August trough. Specifically, the average demand for the last 4 periods (P27-P30) is 29.0, which is significantly higher than the mid-summer average of 19.5 (a ~48% increase). I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method (N=4) to capture this updated Autumn baseline while ignoring the irrelevant summer lows. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 4 periods to reflect the current volatility of this recovering demand trend. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains sufficient stock to meet the rising seasonal demand while avoiding the excessive holding costs seen during the spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery established: Average demand for P27-P30 (late Aug to early Sept) transitioned to 29.0 units, up from the summer low baseline of 19.5 (+48%).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '148033001' (Womens Tights/Stay-ups) is entering the peak Autumn season (mid-September). Period 31 saw a significant spike in demand (64 units), which is more than double the previous 4-week average (29.0). This aligns with the seasonal recovery noted in Carry-over Insights but indicates a sharper acceleration. Current on-hand inventory is 0. With a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, I must place an order that covers this new demand level. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast of 65 units to account for the immediate upward trend and avoid stockouts during this transition. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with this seasonal shift while keeping the base lead time logic responsive to 0-day fulfillment.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand acceleration: Period 31 demand (64 units) is 120% higher than the P27-P30 average (29.0), signaling a rapid transition from recovery to peak season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '148033001' (20 denier stay-ups) is entering the Autumn peak season. Period 31 saw a massive demand spike (64 units), followed by a moderately high Period 32 (39 units). The average demand for the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is 38.6, up from the summer low of ~20. Given the item (tights/leggings) and the current date (late September), demand is expected to remain high or continue climbing as weather cools. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set L to 'default' (0), and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent acceleration in demand (38.6 units/period). I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in Period 31.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand for P28-P32 (late Aug to mid-Sept) has averaged 38.6 units, compared to the July/Aug summer baseline of 19.5 (+98%).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 (20 denier stay-ups) is experiencing a significant autumn peak. Period 33 demand reached 93 units, following a peak of 64 units in Period 31. This is consistent with seasonal patterns for hosiery as weather cools. The average demand for the last three periods (P31-P33) is 65.3 units, compared to the previous 'recovery' average of 29.0. We stock out in Period 33, ending with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this confirmed peak, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (39 to 93 range). This will aggressively raise the base stock level to satisfy the high service level requirement (95% given $19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak acceleration: Average demand for P31-P33 (Sept) is 65.3 units, a 235% increase over the summer low of 19.5 and 125% increase over the early autumn recovery baseline of 29.0.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '148033001' (20 denier stay-up tights) is in a significant autumn peak. Periods 31-34 have seen demand of 64, 39, 93, and 68 respectively, resulting in an average of 66.0 units per period. This is a massive jump from the summer low (~19) and the late August recovery (~29). We are now in October, which is peak season for hosiery as weather cools. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid the stockouts seen in P31 and P33, I am applying a recent_N method where N=4 to capture this new high-demand regime specifically. This sets the base stock against a mean of 66.0, allowing the OR backend to calculate the safety stock needed for the high volatility observed (std dev is significant with demand jumping between 39 and 93). On-hand is 42, so the system will likely order around 50-70 units to reach the new base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified in October (P31-P34): Mean demand reached 66.0 units, a 238% increase over the summer baseline and 127% increase over the early autumn recovery phase.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn peak for 'Stay Up' tights (20 denier), which are seasonally popular in October. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 68.8 units (64, 39, 93, 68, 80), representing a significant and sustained increase over summer levels. Period 33 specifically hit 93 units, causing a stockout. With a current on-hand inventory of 23 units and a promised lead time of 0 (consistently held), we must maintain high stock levels to cover this peak volatility. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current October regime while accounting for the high demand variance (range 39-93). Lead time is set to default as 0 is consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: P31-P35 average demand is 68.8 units, driven by October seasonality for 20 denier hosiery. Significant volatility remains with a peak of 93 units in P33.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (20 denier hosiery) is in its peak autumn seasonal demand phase (October). Demand for the last 6 periods (P31-P36) has averaged 69.2 units per period (64, 39, 93, 68, 80, 71), with high volatility (standard deviation ~18). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a ~95% service level), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the summer lows. This period's starting on-hand is 31, and we need to order enough to cover the immediate demand resolution.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: P31-P36 average demand is 69.2 units, maintaining the significant step-up from the 19.5 summer baseline. Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1881.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 (20 denier stay-ups) is in its peak autumn season (late October), which has historically shown high demand and significant volatility. Period 37 saw a demand of 102 units, causing a stockout as starting on-hand inventory was only 99. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P33-P37) is 82.8 units, compared to the P31-P36 average of 69.2. This indicates a sustained high-demand regime with an upward trend as we move deeper into the autumn/winter season. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on Period 37's arrival. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this heightened demand level (approx 83 units) and using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (stdev of ~15 units) observed during this peak to ensure sufficient safety stock for the high service level target (95% critical ratio).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified further: P33-P37 average demand reached 82.8 units, a 20% increase over the September/early October (P31-P35) average of 68.8. Stockout in P37 (102 units demanded) highlights extreme volatility during peak season.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak autumn/winter season for 20 denier hosiery. Demand in Period 38 was 107 units, matching the total available inventory and resulting in a clean sweep of stock. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P33-P38) is approximately 86.8 units, indicating a much higher baseline than the earlier autumn recovery. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a stockout is significantly more expensive than carrying excess inventory. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N (N=6) to capture this intensified peak (avg ~87). I will also use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this period, including demands of 93, 102, and 107. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak intensified significantly in November: Mean demand for P33-P38 reached 86.8 units (up from P31-P35 avg of 68.8), with multiple peaks exceeding 100 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-November peak for 20 denier hosiery. Demand has intensified significantly since late October (P37-P39), with the last three periods recording demand values of 102, 107, and 97 respectively. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P37-P39) is approximately 102 units, compared to the mean of 86.8 cited in the Period 39 carry-over. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-velocity season and account for the high volatility (peak demand of 107 in P38), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent step-up in demand intensity. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' (N=7) to encompass the high volatility observed since the start of October, ensuring a sufficient safety stock buffer in the OR backend calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensified further in Nov (P37-P39): mean demand reached 102.0 units, a 17% increase over the previous Oct average of 86.8. Volatility remains high with a peak of 107.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 (20 denier stay-ups) is in its peak autumn/winter season. Demand in November has been consistently high, with an average of approximately 102 units over periods 37-39, although Period 40 saw a slight dip to 70 units. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level to prevent stockouts, which have occurred multiple times during this peak. Lead time is stable at 0 periods. To capture the current high-demand regime while accounting for recent high-volume weeks and the slight dip in P40, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the most intense part of the current peak (P37-P40), resulting in a mean demand estimate around 94 units per period. This strategy ensures enough stock is ordered to handle potential spikes back above 100 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is in the middle of the high-demand autumn/winter peak for 20 denier hosiery. Demand remains elevated and volatile, with recent samples (P37-P41) being 102, 107, 97, 70, and 92. The average for these last 5 periods is 93.6 units, maintaining a significantly higher level than the early autumn average. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels during this peak volatility (as seen with stockouts in P37 and near stockouts in P38/P39), I am using the most recent 5-period window (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that sufficiently covers immediate demand while protecting against the high variance observed in this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak maintained through November: Mean demand for P37-P41 is 93.6 units, showing sustained high volume and volatility compared to the October average (82.8).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 148033001 (20 denier hosiery) has surged drastically as we enter December. Period 42 saw record demand of 159 units, causing a stockout. This spike aligns with peak Christmas/holiday party season for tights and stay-ups. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 105.0 units, but the most recent observation (159) suggests we are now in the absolute peak of the year. To avoid further lost sales during this high-profit window (Profit=$19), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent December acceleration (averaging 107.0 units including the 159 outlier). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for immediate replenishment, but the high demand requires aggressive base stock settings to cover the intra-period volatility.

Carry-over insight: December peak season triggered: Demand spiked to 159 units in Period 42, a 50%+ increase over the November average of ~94 units. Stockout confirmed.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season for intimate apparel/hosiery. Demand in Period 42 spiked significantly to 159 units, followed by 85 units in Period 43. The average demand across the last 6 periods (P38-P43) is approximately 101.7 units, but the volatility is extreme (standard deviation approx 31). Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the target service level is 95%. Lead time is reliably 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current high-demand December regime while accounting for the recent spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the significantly increased volatility observed during this winter peak.

Carry-over insight: December peak intensity confirmed: Average demand for P38-P43 is 101.7 units with high volatility (peak of 159). This represents the 'super-peak' holiday regime for the hosiery category.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (December 16th), the peak of the holiday shopping season for 20 denier hosiery. Demand in December is extremely high and volatile, with a recent peak of 159 units (P42) and last period demand of 132 units (P44). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P42-P44) is 125.3 units. Given the proximity to Christmas, demand is likely to remain at 'super-peak' levels for the next one to two weeks before the post-holiday drop. Stockouts are a high risk at this volume (Profit=$19, Holding=$1). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels during this final peak stretch, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high-intensity regime of ~125 units (N=3) and an explicit sigma_hat of 40 to account for the extreme volatility observed (ranging from 85 to 159 in December).

Carry-over insight: December 'super-peak' established: Average demand for P42-P44 reached 125.3 units (+23% over Nov average of ~102), characterized by extreme volatility (std dev ~37).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the absolute peak of the holiday shopping season for 20 denier hosiery. Demand in Period 45 spiked to 177 units, confirming an even more intense 'super-peak' than previously observed (P42-P44 average was 125.3). Historically, demand for this category remains extremely high through Christmas and the New Year. Given a confirmed lead time of 0 (L=0), the backend must order enough to satisfy this period's demand. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the most recent December acceleration (P42: 159, P43: 85, P44: 132, P45: 177), which provides a mean (mu_hat) of approximately 138.25 and adequately captures the high volatility (sigma_hat) of this period. This aggressive setting is necessary to prevent a stockout during the final week of December.

Carry-over insight: December peak intensification: Demand in P45 (177 units) significantly exceeded the P42-P44 average of 125.3, signaling an end-of-year super-peak for the hosiery category.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the final week of December (Period 47: 2019/12/30), which is the tail end of the holiday 'super-peak'. The product is 20 denier hosiery, a category that typically sees a sharp demand spike in December followed by a significant drop-off in January as holiday parties end and post-holiday consumer spending cools. Looking at the demand history, P42-P46 showed a massive surge (159, 85, 132, 177, 132), averaging ~137 units. However, Period 46 (132 units) already shows a decline from the peak of 177 in P45. Following the 'super-peak' logic and standard retail seasonality, I expect demand to regress towards the earlier autumn/winter baseline (~85-95 units) or lower. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P42-P46) would keep expectations too high (avg 137), leading to excessive holding costs in January. I will use recent_N with N=6 (P41-P46) to capture the peak but allow for the start of deceleration. Actual lead time is consistently 0. On-hand is 73, and we need to cover demand immediately after the decision.

Carry-over insight: Holiday 'super-peak' (P42-P46) averaged 137 units. Early signs of post-holiday deceleration observed in P46 (132 vs P45 177). Anticipate regression to Q4 baseline (~90) or lower for January.
