Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Leona | V-neck satin top'. Historically, demand samples range from 133 to 160 across January and early February, with a mean of 146. Given the date is mid-February, we are approaching the transition from winter to spring, where sleeveless items like vest tops/camisoles often see a gradual uptick in interest for layering or warmer weather. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should ideally arrive during this same period. However, we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Since the lead time is short and holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0), the backend logic (base-stock policy) will target a 50% service level (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), essentially ordering up to the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the most relevant demand profile from the provided samples (148, 133, 150, 139, 160).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed an actual lead time of 0 periods (ordered and arrived in P1), which matches the promised lead time. The demand in P1 was 144 units, which is consistent with the historical samples (ranging from 133 to 160, mean \u2248 146). The current date is February 18th, and the product is a 'V-neck satin top', a women's garment. Given the proximity to spring, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly increase as it transitions into a seasonal peak, though the first 5 historical samples do not yet show a clear upward trend. I will use the mean of all available historical samples (including P1 demand) to forecast. Since L=0, we need to cover demand for Period 2 (L+1=1). mu_hat value will be set to (1+0) * ~146.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'V-neck satin top with a lace trim', which is a seasonal spring/summer fashion item. Current date is Feb 25th (Period 3). Historical demand samples for Jan/Feb were (148, 133, 150, 139, 160), with an average around 146. However, demand in Period 2 spiked to 165, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). The promised lead time is 0, and observations verify that orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since spring demand is likely to increase for this type of garment, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the recent upward trend in demand and volatility. N=5 covers the provided pre-game history and the two game periods observed so far.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (V-neck satin top) is experiencing a steady increase in demand as we approach Spring (late February/early March). Historical samples from January/early February averaged ~146 units. However, recent weekly demands in February were 144, 165, and 184 units. The 'In-transit' and 'On-hand' are both zero, meaning the system started empty before the Period 4 decision. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts which occurred in Periods 2 and 3 (sold < demand), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this upward trend while maintaining the default lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected: demand increased from early Feb avg of ~145 to 184 units by late Feb (+27%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a Women's V-neck satin vest top, which typically sees increasing demand as spring progresses. Historical demand has shown a clear upward trend: 144 (P1), 165 (P2), 184 (P3), and 188 (P4). The last four weeks have an average of 170.25, while the last two weeks average 186. Given the stockouts in Periods 2, 3, and 4 (selling all units arrived), actual demand is likely higher than sold units (lost sales occurred). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the recent demand surge and mitigate future stockouts, I will use a 3-period average for mu_hat (approx 179 per period) and increase the safety margin using explicit values based on the recent trend + anticipation of spring seasonality. Setting mu_hat to 195 (for L+1 = 1 period) to account for the upward momentum.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: demand increased from Jan/early Feb average of ~145 to ~185+ in late Feb/early March (+27%+). Likely seasonal trend for spring apparel.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. The product is a 'V-neck satin top', which is a spring/summer seasonal item. We are currently in a higher demand regime compared to January/early February. Demand in the last three periods (P3-P5) has been 184, 188, and 170 (average ~181). Although P5 demand (170) was lower than P4, it remains significantly above the initial 145 average. Stockouts in Periods 2, 3, and 4 indicate we were under-ordering relative to actual demand. The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm actual lead time has consistently been 0. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-demand spring regime (P3-P5) while reacting to the slightly lower P5 figure to avoid excessive holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (z=0).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, entering the spring season for women's apparel. The SKU (satin vest top) is experiencing a clear upward demand trend. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 146, but recent realized demand (Periods 3-6) has increased to an average of 186.5 (184, 188, 170, 204). Period 6 saw a stockout situation where 181 units were available but demand was 204, indicating we are currently under-forecasting the spring surge. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-growth regime (approx 187 units/period) while ignoring the lower Jan/Feb baseline. This will increase the base stock to better satisfy the mounting spring demand and avoid further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Sustained spring demand growth confirmed: March demand average has risen to 186.5, a 28% increase over the Jan/Feb baseline of 146.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '618800001' (Womens Vest top) is entering April, exhibiting a significant upward demand trend as spring progresses. Recent demand history shows a clear regime shift: Jan/Feb baseline was ~146, while the last 4 periods (March) averaged 204.75 units (188, 170, 204, 257). The most recent demand (Period 7) spiked to 257, which resulted in a massive stockout since the system only ordered 187. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To handle the accelerating demand and high stockout risk, I am moving to an explicit mu_hat forecast. I will forecast a weekly demand of 260 units based on the most recent peak and the start of peak spring shopping in April. Since L=0, the formula is (1+L)*demand = 1 * 260 = 260. I am also increasing sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Significant April demand acceleration confirmed: Period 7 demand spiked to 257 (+39% over March average), indicating a strong seasonal peak for spring apparel.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. This product is a 'V-neck satin top', which is a seasonal spring/summer garment. We are observing a significant and accelerating demand spike: demand jumped from ~187 in Period 6 to 257 in Period 7, and then surged to 394 in Period 8. This represents a 53% increase week-over-week. Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand with 0 in-transit because the lead time is 0 (arrivals occur same-period as order), but we are consistently stocking out because demand is outstripping my previous parameters. To capture the full volume of this peak demand and prevent further lost sales, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the most recent demand (394) plus a growth buffer to account for the current trend. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the increased volatility during this high-growth phase. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Hyper-growth phase confirmed for April; demand increased from 257 to 394 (+53%) in one week. Sustained stockouts occurred despite increasing order sizes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-38.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '618800001' (V-neck satin top) experienced a massive surge in demand throughout April, peaking at 394 units in Period 8. However, Period 9 demand dropped significantly to 206 units. This suggests we have passed the initial hyper-growth peak and are entering a stabilization phase within the spring season. Historical data shows demand was ~185 in March and spiked in early April. The Period 9 demand (206) is much closer to the late March levels than the peak spike of 394. To avoid excessive holding costs (which are $1.0 vs $1.0 profit), I am transitioning from chasing the absolute peak to a more balanced forecast. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (average of 257, 394, 206 = 285.6) and sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in the last three weeks of April transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in April: peak demand of 394 (Period 8) followed by a 47% drop to 206 (Period 9), indicating the spring peak may have passed and demand is settling into a 200-250 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the demand history for the V-neck satin top, we observed a massive peak in early April (Period 8 demand = 394), which has since stabilized into a new regime. The last two periods show demand of 206 and 233, averaging approximately 220 units. This suggests the hyper-growth phase associated with early spring shopping has passed, and we are now in a post-peak spring regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which simplifies inventory management. Currently, we have 53 units on hand and 0 in transit. To set parameters for the OR backend, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this post-peak stabilization (covering periods 8, 9, and 10), which effectively filters out the initial growth phase while incorporating the peak's volatility (sigma) and the current downward correction (mu). This should prevent over-ordering as the season progresses while maintaining a buffer for the observed high variance.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: After an early April spike (394 units), demand has stabilized at an average of ~220 units over the last two weeks (P9-P10), down 44% from the peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a satin vest top, which has experienced a significant seasonal peak throughout April. After a brief dip in mid-April (P9-P10), demand surged again in Period 11 to 306 units. Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory currently stands at 0 units on-hand and in-transit following the recent sell-out. Given the volatility (demand sequence: 257, 394, 206, 233, 306), I need to set parameters that capture the high recent volume while accounting for the significant variance. I will use recent_N (N=4) to focus on the April regime (avg ~285) rather than the lower March/February baseline, and use recent_N for sigma to account for the high volatility observed in this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Late April demand rebound: After a post-peak dip to ~220 units, demand surged to 306 in Period 11, suggesting a second wave or extended spring peak for this SKU.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Leona V-neck satin top' is experiencing high volatility as it enters May, which is likely a sustained peak season for women's vest tops. After a significant demand spike in early April (394 units) and a subsequent dip, demand has rebounded and averaged 255 units over the last 4 periods (P9-P12). The most recent demand was 225 units, showing that although the extreme hyper-growth phase has cooled, demand remains high and unpredictable. Historically, the lead time has been consistent at 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts (which occurred in P11), I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the current post-peak demand level (~255 units/week). I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed during April and May, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer given that profit and holding costs are equal (q=0.5, z*=0).

Carry-over insight: May demand regime: demand remains volatile but elevated, averaging ~255 units over the last 4 periods (P9-P12), compared to the earlier March average of ~186.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-123.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand dropped significantly to 60 units, down from the previous four-period average of ~255. This represents a 76% decrease and suggests the late spring peak for this 'V-neck satin top' has ended as we move into mid-May. The current on-hand inventory of 183 units covers over 3x the most recent demand. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (which equal profit at $1.0/unit), I am shifting the mu_hat forecast to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this downward trend while still accounting for the possibility that Period 13 was an outlier. Given the history of 0-period lead times, I will maintain 'default' for L. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to maintain higher coverage given the historical volatility (60 to 394 units) seen throughout the spring season.

Carry-over insight: Demand collapse detected in mid-May (Period 13): demand dropped to 60 units from a prior 4-period average of ~255 (-76%), indicating a potential end to the spring seasonal peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-59.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data from Period 13 (demand = 60) and Period 14 (demand = 69) confirms a sharp downturn from the spring seasonal peak (avg ~255), likely marking the end of the high-demand season for this lace-trim satin top. This matches the 'demand collapse' noted in Period 14 carry-over. I am using recent_N (N=2) to reflect this new low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as using the historical average would result in excessive overstocking. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 128 units, which already exceeds the recent demand levels (~65/period). the OR backend will calculate a base_stock around 65-75 units, leading to a zero order this period to burn off the current surplus and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed starting Period 13: demand has dropped from a peak-season average of ~255 to a baseline of ~65 units (-75%), indicating the end of the spring seasonal trend.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (Women's satin vest top) has clearly exited its spring seasonal peak. Demand shifted from a high-season average of ~255 units to a low-season baseline beginning in Period 13. The demand over the last three periods (P13-P15) was 60, 69, and 48, averaging 59 units. This represents a ~77% drop from the spring average. The current on-hand inventory is 80 units, which already exceeds the recent weekly average. Given the confirmed demand regime shift and the current ending inventory, I will set parameters to reflect this lower demand baseline (recent_N=3) to prevent further overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the current period's demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 618800001 (V-neck satin top) has clearly entered a post-peak, low-demand regime following the spring season. Since Period 13 (early May), demand has dropped significantly from the spring average of ~255 units to a much lower baseline. The last four periods show demand values of 60, 69, 48, and 48, establishing a stable average of approximately 56 units. Current on-hand inventory is 32 units, which is below this new expected weekly demand. To maintain a safe level of inventory for the upcoming week and ensure high service levels without overstocking (given the equal Profit and Holding cost of $1.0), I will target a base stock level that reflects this new regime. Using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations captures this stabilization most accurately. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime for early summer stabilized at 56 units/period (average of P13-P16) compared to the spring peak average of ~255 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 618800001 (Women's Satin Top/Vest) has successfully transitioned from a high spring peak (Feb-Apr, ~250 units/period) to a stable summer baseline. In the late spring/early summer phase (Period 13 to Period 17), demand has averaged approximately 51.6 units per period (60, 69, 48, 48, 33). The most recent period (P17) showed a further softening to 33 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 24 units. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a service level in this lower-demand regime, I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, which captures the shift starting from Period 13 and reflects the current sub-60 unit demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime established: Demand has stabilized at a lower baseline averaging ~50 units (P13-P17) following the end of the spring seasonal peak.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product (a satin vest top) has transitioned from a high-demand spring peak (averaging ~255 units in April/early May) to a stable summer baseline. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), demand has been significantly lower and remarkably stable, with values of 60, 69, 48, 48, 33, and 31. This indicates a clear post-peak regime. The average of the most recent 3 periods is 37.3 units, while the average of the last 6 is 48.1. Given the downward trend toward a stable mid-summer baseline, I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this regime shift while acknowledging the recent stabilization around 30-40 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 21 units, and there are no units in transit. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 will align the OR backend with this lower demand environment, preventing over-ordering and minimizing holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the summer baseline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (Women's satin top) has transitioned from its high-demand spring peak (March-April) into a stable summer regime. Demand over the last three periods (P17-P19) has consistently hovered in the mid-30s (33, 31, 36), representing a further downshift from the late-May baseline of ~50. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with same-period arrivals confirmed throughout the history. Given the stability of this new low-demand regime, I am using a recent_N strategy with N=3 to capture the most current mean (~33 units) and volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand while minimizing holding costs as we hold 13 units on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime further stabilized at ~33 units/period (P17-P19), down from the late-spring plateau of ~50.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '618800001' is a 'V-neck satin top', which is a summer-oriented garment. We are now entering Period 21 (July 1st). Historically, demand for this item peaked in April/May (up to 394 units) and dropped through June. However, Period 20 showed a significant demand spike to 72 units from a previous 4-period average of ~33 units. This suggests a potential mid-summer demand increase or a specific July-related seasonal push. Current on-hand is 0 due to the unexpected demand surge in P20. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this new upward volatility while respecting the lower summer baseline, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat (capturing the P20 jump) and sigma_hat. This balances the recent low-demand baseline with the high-demand signal from the most recent period.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand rebound detected: Period 20 demand jumped to 72 units (+118% over the previous 3-period average of 33).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering July with a significant demand rebound. After a low summer baseline of ~33 units/period (P17-P19), demand has doubled to exactly 72 units for two consecutive periods (P20-P21). This suggests a new mid-summer demand regime, possibly driven by warm weather or sales events affecting the 'Womens Everyday Collection' satin tops. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. To prevent the stockouts observed in the last two periods (ending on-hand inventory = 0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P19-P21) to capture this upward shift while giving higher weight to the recent 72-unit observations. This will target the new mean of ~60 units while accounting for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand rebound confirmed: July demand (P20-P21) has stabilized at 72 units/period, a 118% increase over the June baseline of 33 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'V-neck satin top' is currently in a mid-summer demand phase (July). After a sudden jump to 72 units in Periods 20 and 21 (a 118% increase over the June baseline of ~33), demand stabilized/corrected to 40 units in Period 22. This suggests the 'rebound' seen earlier may be volatile or settling into a new July average of approximately 60 units ((72+72+40)/3 = 61.3). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this recent 3-period average (~61) rather than the long-term historical mean to avoid over-ordering based on the high spring peaks or under-ordering based on the June lows. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current volatility observed in the July transition.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand (July) is averaging ~61 units (P20-P22), showing higher volatility than the June baseline of 33 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'V-neck satin top with lace trim', currently in late July. Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Demand has shown distinct seasonal behavior: a heavy spring peak (March-April), a collapse in May to a low of ~35 units, and a moderate rebound in July. Looking at recent weeks: P20 (72), P21 (72), P22 (40), and P23 (31). The mid-summer rebound (averaging ~61 in early July) is cooling down as we approach late July. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P20-P23) is 53.75 units. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture the current descending trend while acknowledging the recent volatility, as a baseline average of all samples would be skewed by the massive spring peak. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current volatility levels.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a women's satin vest top, which typically sees seasonal demand. Period 24 demand (64 units) shows a persistence of the July 'rebound' identified in carry-over insights, with July demand (Periods 21-24) now averaging 51.75 units. This is higher than the June baseline of ~33 units but lower than the spring peak. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory starting for Period 25 is 0. To capture this mid-summer stabilization/rebound while accounting for recent volatility (July demand has ranged from 31 to 72), I will use the recent_N method based on the last 5 periods (Period 20-24) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the shift from late June into July. N=5 is chosen because it covers the entirety of the current summer 'rebound' regime plus the transition point.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) clarified: Average demand for Period 20-24 is 55.8 units, confirming a sustained shift from the June baseline of 33 units, though with significant weekly variance (SD \u2248 19).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (August 5, 2019). Analyzing the history, demand shifted from a June baseline of ~33 units per period to a mid-summer (July) regime characterized by higher volume and volatility. The demand for the last six periods (P20\u2013P25) has been 72, 72, 40, 31, 64, and 43, resulting in a mean of 53.6 units and a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. This confirms the 'Mid-summer demand regime' noted in carry-over insights. Lead time (L) is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period). Setting L=0, mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current stable-but-volatile July/August regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent high variance. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the higher average and the fluctuations observed in July, minimizing stockouts seen in P20, P21, and P24 while managing holding costs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/8/12). Historical demand for this satin vest top showed a significant spring peak from March to early May, followed by a lower summer baseline. After a mid-summer rebound in July (averaging ~56 units), demand in late July and early August has softened again (43 units in P25 and 30 units in P26). This suggests a transition from the mid-summer peak into a late-summer/pre-fall period where demand for such lightweight apparel typically cools. Average demand over the most recent 7 periods (P20-P26) is approximately 50 units. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the backend targeting a 50% service level is appropriate. I will use a recent_N of 7 to capture the mid-to-late summer average while acknowledging the recent slowdown. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand softening: After a mid-summer average of ~56 (P20-P24), demand has decreased to an average of ~36 in the first two weeks of August (P25-P26).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a late-summer softening. Over the last three weeks (P25-P27), demand has stabilized at an average of 40.33 units (43, 30, 48), compared to the mid-summer (July) average of ~56. The product is a v-neck satin top, which typically sees declining demand as the transition from summer to autumn begins in late August. Inventory is currently low (3 units on-hand), and lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture this most recent late-summer baseline (approx 40 units/period) while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility within this regime.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (August): Demand has stabilized at an average of ~40 units (P25-P27), down from the mid-summer average of ~56 units (-28%).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. This SKU is a 'V-neck satin top', which typically experiences a major spring-season peak followed by lower, variable summer demand. Recent history shows a 'late-summer' regime. Demand in Period 28 was 69 units, which is higher than the previously established August average of ~40 units, but matches the volatility seen throughout July (where demand fluctuated between 31 and 72). However, on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the high demand in P28. Lead time consistently remains 0. To capture the recent variability while acknowledging the overall lower baseline compared to spring, I will use a recent_N window of 4 (Periods 25-28), which averages 47.5 units per period. This covers the most recent window of late August data and balances the recent spike with the preceding lower weeks.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September (2019/9/2), transitioning from a late-summer regime. Recent demand (P28-P29) has shown a significant uptick, with a 2-period average of 66 units, compared to the August average of 40 units identified in the previous period's carry-over. This likely indicates an early-autumn rebound or localized back-to-school demand for this 'V-neck satin top'. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to two consecutive weeks of stockouts where demand exceeded supply. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent rebound while managing the risk of volatility, I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat (average demand of 60) and sigma_hat to respond quickly to this new upward trend and restore service levels.

Carry-over insight: Early September demand rebound: Demand has increased from an August baseline of ~40 units to a 2-period average (P28-P29) of 66 units (+65%).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (Women's V-neck satin top) is experiencing a transition from its summer baseline into a September growth phase. Demand has increased from an August average of ~40 units to a 3-period average (P28-P30) of 68 units (69, 63, 72). This represents a significant and sustained ~70% increase compared to the previous month. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout history. To capture this new demand level and avoid stockouts seen in the last three periods, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' window of 3 for mu_hat (to align with the last 3 weeks of growth) and 'recent_N' of 5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock reflective of the current 68-unit mean rather than the historical average.

Carry-over insight: September demand growth confirmed: Demand has shifted from an August baseline of ~40 units to a sustained 3-week average of 68 units (P28-P30), a ~70% increase.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for this V-neck satin top has transitioned from an August baseline of ~40 units to a September average of approximately 65 units (P28-P31: 69, 63, 72, 55). While the latest period (P31) saw a slight dip to 55 units, the overall September trend remains significantly higher than the late-summer trough. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current September regime since Period 28. This approach aligns with the Carry-Over Insights and accounts for the ~65-70% demand increase observed since August.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (Women's Vest Top) is transitioning into late September. Reviewing the demand history from Period 28 to Period 32 (Aug 19 \u2013 Sep 16), demand showed an initial September rebound (averaging ~68 units P28-P30) but dropped sharply to 29 units in Period 32. This drop likely signals the end of the early autumn transition or a return to a lower late-season baseline. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is currently 36. Given the recent demand drop, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the September average of approximately 52 units. This helps prevent over-ordering as the season cools down, balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: September demand volatility: initial rebound to ~68 units (P28-P30) followed by a sharp drop to 29 units in P32, suggesting a potential end to the early autumn peak for this vest top.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (Women's Vest Top) is currently in the September/early October transition period. After a period of growth in early September (averaging ~68 units), Period 32 saw a sharp dip (29) followed by a rebound in Period 33 to 70 units. This suggests the autumn demand is still active despite the high volatility observed in P32. The 'September demand volatility' insight from Period 33 reflects this. Given the current date is September 30, we should expect demand to remain around the September average of approximately 50-60 units before potentially tapering off for winter. For Period 34, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the average behavior since late August (P28-P33), which includes both the September peaks and the recent dip (Avg \u2248 60). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=6) to account for the heightened volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand volatility confirmed: Demand fluctuates significantly (range 29-72) around a mean of ~60 units for the late September period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '618800001' (vest top) is in an early October context. Recent demand (P28-P34) shows significant weekly volatility, ranging from 25 to 72 units. The 7-period average is approximately 53 units, but the most recent 4 periods (P31-P34) average 44.75 units following a late September peak attempt. Given the high variance (standard deviation around 20 units in this regime), I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this September/October transition baseline. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to account for the high volatility observed in the last two weeks (P33 saw 70 demand, P34 saw 25). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early October demand regime (P28-P34) established an average of 53 units with high volatility (range 25-72).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October. Demand for the V-neck satin vest top has entered a more volatile phase following the September rebound. While Period 33 peaked at 70, the last two periods (P34-P35) have seen a significant cooling, with demand dropping to 25 and 19 units respectively. This suggests a late-autumn decline as temperatures drop further. The recent 3-period average (P33-P35) is ~38 units, but the last 2 periods specifically average only 22 units. Given the transition into late October, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward trend while accounting for the high volatility (sigma). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-October demand cooling detected: Demand dropped from a late-September peak of 70 (P33) to an average of 22 units (P34-P35), a 68% decrease, likely signaling the transition out of the early autumn peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (a V-neck satin vest top) is experiencing a post-autumn cooling period as we enter late October. Recent demand has significantly dropped from the late-September peak (demand of 70) to a three-week average of approximately 19 units (P34-P36: 25, 19, 13). This follows the pattern of previous seasonal transitions observed in May and August. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking in a high-holding-cost environment (H=$1.0, P=$1.0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this new lower-demand regime. This will adjust the base stock to reflect the current mean of ~19 units rather than the higher historical average.

Carry-over insight: Mid-October demand regime confirmed: demand has declined for three consecutive weeks (P34-P36) to an average of 19 units, down 64% from the early October average of 53 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the satin vest top has clearly moved into a late-autumn low-demand phase. The last four periods (P34-P37) have seen demand values of 25, 19, 13, and 21, averaging approximately 19.5 units per period. This is a significant drop (approx. 64%) from the volatile early-October period. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the low holding cost ($1.0) and profit ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level. With 4 units currently on-hand and a mean demand near 20, I will set mu_hat to reflects this new regime. I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current stable floor while filtering out the prior volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime confirmed (P34-P37): Demand has stabilized at an average of 19.5 units, representing a sustained floor after the autumn peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is enters early November. Historically, this 'Vest top' (summer-oriented apparel) saw a significant demand drop in October to a baseline of ~20 units. However, Period 38 showed a sudden spike to 44 units, more than double the previous 4-period average (P34-P37: 19.5 units). While this could be a pre-holiday anomaly or clearance activity, the inventory is currently 0. Given the profit ($1) vs holding cost ($1) ratio suggests a 50% service level target (z=0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent baseline while acknowledging the recent spike. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility observed between the 13-21 range and the 44-unit outlier. Lead time L=0 is consistently maintained.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Late October demand rebound detected; demand increased from a 4-period average of 19.5 to 44 units in Period 38 (+125%), disrupting the late-autumn floor. Need to monitor if this is a sustained November trend.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November (Period 40). Recent demand history shows a clear rebound from October lows (~19 units) to a two-week average of 42.5 units (P38-P39: 44, 41). This represents a +118% increase over the late-autumn floor. Given the product is a satin vest top with lace trim, this spike likely aligns with early holiday season/party wear demand or Singles' Day (11/11) promotions. Stockouts occurred in the last two periods due to this unanticipated surge. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will adopt a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this higher demand regime while capturing the increased volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a sufficient base stock to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: November holiday/promotional demand rebound: Demand has increased from a late-October floor of ~19 units to 42.5 units (P38-P39 average), a 118% surge likely tied to seasonal party wear or 11/11 shopping events.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (V-neck satin top) is entering a late-autumn/early-winter rebound. Demand has increased for three consecutive weeks (P38-P40) from a baseline of ~19 units to a recent average of 47.7 units (44, 41, 58). This shift aligns with common November retail peaks (Single's Day/11.11 and pre-holiday shopping). Given consecutive stockouts despite increasing orders, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture this upward momentum and ensure the service level target is met. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for immediate adjustments. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current higher volatility during this rebound phase.

Carry-over insight: November demand rebound confirmed: Demand has shifted from a late-October floor of ~19 to a 3-week average (P38-P40) of 47.7 units (+150%), likely driven by 11/11 promotions and holiday season preparation.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a confirmed late-autumn/early-winter demand rebound. Looking at the history, Period 41 demand hit 73 units, and the average over the last four periods (P38-P41) is 54 units (44, 41, 58, 73). This upward trend correlates with seasonal peaks for 'V-neck satin tops' used for holiday parties and shopping events like Black Friday (approaching this week). Demand has increased significantly from the Oct floor of 19.5 units. Because the current trend is rising (73 units in P41), I will use a restricted window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the holiday surge while using explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in previous demand peaks for this SKU. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: Demand has risen for four consecutive weeks (P38-P41), reaching 73 units, a 274% increase from the Oct baseline of ~19.5 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand exploded to 542 units, a massive outlier compared to the previous week's 73 units. This corresponds to the Black Friday/Cyber Monday week (late November 2019), representing a hyper-peak for this 'everyday collection' satin top. Given the inventory was exhausted (ending on-hand 0, in-transit 0), we must significantly increase the base stock level for Period 43 to capture any lingering holiday demand or potential 12/12 shopping event spikes. While demand may drop from the 542 absolute peak, the 4-week average (P39-P42) including the spike is ~178.5 units. Using mu_hat = 300 to provide a buffer for remaining holiday volatility while acknowledging the extreme spike in Period 42. Since the promised lead time is 0 and consistently observed as 0, L remains 'default'. Standard deviation is set high via 'explicit' to account for the extreme volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday hyper-peak confirmed: Period 42 demand spiked to 542 units (+642% over the prior week's 73 units), confirming extreme seasonal volatility for the late-November promotional period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44, following the massive Black Friday spike (P42 demand: 542) and a significant post-peak follow-up (P43 demand: 297). The system is now entering the post-Black Friday / early December phase (Date: 2019/12/9). Historically, after such extreme promotional peaks, demand tends to drop but remains higher than the pre-peak floor (which was ~20-50 units). In Period 43, it dropped by ~45% from the peak to 297. For Period 44, I expect a further deceleration as we move away from 11/11 and Black Friday but still benefit from holiday shopping. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the expected tapering of demand\u2014setting it to 180 to prevent excessive inventory if the post-peak drop-off is sharp, while keeping sigma_hat high (recent_N=3) to account for the extreme volatility observed over the last month (73 vs 542 vs 297).

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand cooling detected: Period 43 demand dropped to 297 from a peak of 542 (-45%), but remain well above the November baseline of ~50. Expected further stabilization in early December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), following the massive Black Friday hyper-peak (P42: 542 units) and a significant post-peak cooling (P43: 297, P44: 132). Current demand of 132 units indicates that while the promotional peak is over, holiday demand for this 'V-neck satin top' remains substantially higher than the October baseline of ~20 units. Based on typical retail patterns, demand is likely to remain steady or slightly decline leading up to Christmas before a sharper drop in late December. I am setting the mean demand calculation based on the most recent 2 periods (P43-P44) where demand has begun to stabilize post-Black Friday. This uses a mean of approx 215 units per period. With a lead time of 0 (confirmed consistently in history), mu_hat (1+L) should target this level. Sigma_hat is set to the recent period volatility to account for the ongoing transition from the hyper-peak. On-hand inventory is 48, so the OR backend will order to reach the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand cooling confirmed: Demand dropped from a hyper-peak of 542 (P42) to 132 (P44). Mid-December demand is averaging ~215 units (P43-P44), significantly higher than the pre-holiday baseline but follows a rapid deceleration pattern.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late December holiday period (Period 46). Demand has been extremely volatile due to Black Friday (P42: 542 units) and a significant pre-Christmas surge in Period 45 (475 units), which resulted in a stockout. The mid-December average (P43-P45) is approximately 301 units, but demand is expected to drop sharply once the Christmas/New Year holiday peaks pass. For Period 46, I suspect we are at the tail end of the holiday surge. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (the median). I will use an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this high-volume but high-uncertainty phase. Setting mu_hat to 350 (above the 3-period average but below the recent peak) and a high sigma_hat of 120 to provide a safety buffer against another potential surge before the January sales slump. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late December holiday surge confirmed: Demand spiked again to 475 in P45 after a post-Black Friday cooling to 132 in P44. Current Dec average is ~300 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late December/early January transition period (current date: 2019/12/30). Historically, demand for this 'Womens Everyday Collection' vest top peaked heavily during the Black Friday (P42: 542 units) and pre-Christmas weeks (P45: 475 units). The most recent demand (P46) was 271 units, showing a significant drop from the Christmas peak but remaining well above the pre-holiday baseline. As we enter January, demand typically cools down significantly after the holiday party and gift-giving season. However, there is often a secondary 'New Year/Sales' effect. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the post-Black Friday average (P43-P46 = ~293 units) but use an explicit mu_hat reduction to anticipate the typical January slowdown. Since lead time is consistently 0, the backend will target a base stock roughly equal to the mean + z*sigma. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Christmas demand cooling: Demand dropped from a late-December peak of 475 (P45) to 271 (P46), a 43% decrease. Anticipating further normalization towards the January baseline.
