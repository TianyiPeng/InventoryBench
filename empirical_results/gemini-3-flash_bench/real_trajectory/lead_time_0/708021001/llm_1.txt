  "rationale": "Product 708021001 is a 'PINKY Loose Fitted Tank', a fast-drying jersey sports vest top for ladies. Given the date (Feb 11), we are moving from late winter into spring, which usually signals an uptick in fitness-related apparel demand as people prepare for warmer weather. Historical demand shows a peak of 115 (Jan 7), followed by a dip (low of 6 on Jan 28), and a recent bounce back to 64 (Feb 4). Average historic demand across the 5 provided points is ~55 units per period. Since promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival), and current on-hand/in-transit is 0, I need to order enough for Period 1 demand. I will target the historical average (~55) plus a safety buffer for the potential spring ramp-up and to account for the high variance seen in January.
