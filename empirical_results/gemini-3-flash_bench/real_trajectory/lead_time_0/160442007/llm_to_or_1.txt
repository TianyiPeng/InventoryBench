Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 160442007 (3p Sneaker Socks). The historical demand data provided (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows values of 123, 105, 114, 133, and 95. The average of these 5 samples is 114 and the standard deviation is approximately 14.65. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no prior 'conclude' messages to verify actual lead time, I will stick with the promised L=0. Given the product is socks and we are in mid-February, I expect demand to be relatively stable or slightly increasing as we approach spring. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent statistics while smoothing out individual week volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which typically experiences stable demand but can see slight increases as spring approaches. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 11) are: 123, 105, 114, 133, 95, and 114. The mean of these 6 samples is 114.17 with a standard deviation of 12.87. In Period 1, we ordered 114 units which arrived immediately (lead_time=0), and all 114 were sold, leaving 0 on-hand. The actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5 (50%), meaning the base stock should be near the median demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture all available data points for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the demand appears relatively stable with no clear regime shift yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 160442007 (3p Sneaker Socks) is experiencing a significant demand spike. Period 2 demand was 231, more than double the Period 1 demand of 114 and well above the pre-game average of ~114. This aligns with late February entering the spring season when sneaker sock demand typically rises. Since Profit=1 and Holding=1, the critical ratio q = 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on Period 1 and 2 arrivals. I have currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, leading to lost sales in Period 2. To capture the new demand level and prevent stockouts, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=5 including pre-game samples) but explicitly adjust mu_hat upward to 230 to reflect the new regime observed in Period 2. Sigma_hat remains based on recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 2: Demand increased from approx 114 to 231 (+100%). Lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/3/4. We are managing 3p Sneaker Socks. Analysis of the demand history shows a jump from an initial average of ~114 units to a new regime starting in Period 2. The demand for Period 2 was 231 and Period 3 was 203, averaging 217. This confirms the carry-over insight of a ~100% increase. The product categories (Womens Socks) often see a spring uptick. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods based on the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1, 2, and 3. I have 27 units on hand. To maintain the service level across the next period (L+1=1), I will use the mean of the last 2 samples (Periods 2 and 3) as the basis for mu_hat. N=2 is the length of the current regime. Since the standard deviation is significant (approx 20 units), I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat as well to ensure we cover variability in this new higher-demand period.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is women's sneaker socks. Historically, demand was around 114 units (Jan/early Feb), then surged to an average of 217 in Period 2 and 3. In Period 4, demand dropped to 138. This suggests a temporary peak, possibly linked to early spring shopping, that is now normalizing or stabilizing at a slightly higher level than the winter baseline. I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new post-surge regime (Periods 2-4), which averages 190.6 units per period. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all four historical periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 will allow the OR backend to adjust to this cooling but still elevated demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility observed during the demand surge and subsequent drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-surge: Period 4 demand (138) shows a significant decrease from Period 2-3 peak (~217), suggesting the early spring surge is cooling.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 18, 2019. The product is 3p Sneaker Socks, which typically sees higher demand as spring begins and consumers switch to low-cut footwear. Historically, we saw a massive surge in late February (Periods 2-3, avg 217), followed by a cool-down in March (Periods 4-5, avg 142.5). However, as we approach late March and April, demand for 'sneaker socks' is expected to remain firm or grow slightly as the weather continues to warm. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods of data (N=2) to capture the stabilized demand floor of ~143 units, while maintaining a recent volatility estimate (sigma_hat with N=3) to account for the fluctuations seen since the initial surge. With L=0, the OR backend targets a base stock of one period's demand (current period); because Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, which is appropriate for a high-volume, low-margin staple like socks to avoid excessive holding costs while meeting the current demand pace.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a '3p Sneaker Socks' product. The current date is March 25, 2019. Historically, demand for low-cut sneaker socks spikes as spring transitions into warmer weather. After a temporary dip in Periods 4 and 5 (average 142), demand surged to 214 in Period 6, resulting in a stockout. This 214 value is consistent with the earlier surge in Period 2 (231) and Period 3 (203). Given the warming weather toward April, I expect demand to remain in this higher regime (avg ~216). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent another stockout, I am setting mu_hat using the mean of the high-demand periods (P2, P3, P6), which is approximately 216. Since L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*216. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for the volatility seen between the low and high phases (~40).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Resurgence of high demand (214 units) in Period 6 aligns with seasonal spring demand for sneaker socks. Expected demand level is ~216 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. This SKU (3p Sneaker Socks) is entering its peak seasonal demand phase as weather warms and consumers shift to low-profile footwear. Recent demand shows a strong upward trend: P6 (214 units) and P7 (285 units), both resulting in stockouts (ending on-hand: 0). The carry-over insight accurately identified a resurgence, but the magnitude is exceeding previous expectations. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current demand is 285 and the trend is clearly increasing as we enter April, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting this higher level. I'll set mu_hat to 310 (L=0 means mu_hat covers 1 period) to account for seasonal growth and avoid further stockouts. sigma_hat will be set explicitly to 45 to handle the high volatility seen in the last two periods (214 to 285).

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand growth confirmed: March/April transition shows demand surge from 147 (P5) to 285 (P7), a ~94% increase over 3 periods, correlating with spring seasonality for sneaker socks.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. We are in a strong upward seasonal trend for sneaker socks as spring progresses. Demand has risen consistently over the last three periods (214 in P6, 285 in P7, and 320 in P8), resulting in three consecutive stockouts despite aggressive ordering. The current lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To capture this growth and minimize lost sales, I will use recent_N with N=3 to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the latest high-demand regime. This period's base stock calculation will automatically adjust for the 0-period lead time, aiming to cover the expected demand of approximately 273 units plus a safety buffer while acknowledging the recent peak of 320.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal growth confirmed: Demand increased for three consecutive weeks (P6-P8), rising from 214 to 320 units (+50%), leading to persistent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), the demand for sneaker socks is in a strong seasonal upswing, though Period 9 saw a temporary dip to 180 units after a peak of 320 in Period 8. The stockouts in Periods 6, 7, and 8 indicate that demand frequently exceeds available supply during this spring window. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently confirmed by history. For Period 10, since we are in a high-demand seasonal regime despite the P9 dip, I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the higher late-March/early-April mean (~250 units) rather than the all-history mean (~195). This N=4 window (Periods 6-9) averages 249.75 units, reflecting the current seasonal strength and ensuring enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the Period 9 deceleration. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442007' (Sneaker Socks) is in a high-demand spring season. Recent demand has stabilized after a peak, with Period 9 and 10 showing demand of 180 and 209 units respectively, following a surge to 320. The current date is April 22nd. Historically, the last 4 periods (P7-P10) show a mean demand of 248.5 units. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current seasonal level while acknowledging the recent slight cooling from the peak. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been a stable 0.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019, which is the pre-summer season for sneaker socks. Historical demand since Period 6 (March 18) indicates a sustained seasonal peak, with demand consistently exceeding 200 units (except P9). Specifically, the last two weeks (P10-P11) saw demands of 209 and 233. The 'in-transit' is 0 and on-hand inventory is low at 16. I will use recent_N (last 6 periods, P6-P11) to capture this higher demand regime, as using the full history would underestimate the current seasonal baseline. The lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders within the same period they were placed. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the anticipated 200+ unit weekly demand plus a safety margin to avoid the stockouts seen earlier in the season.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, the peak of the spring/summer season for sneaker socks. Historical demand shows a persistent upward trend and high volatility, with the most recent demand (Period 12) reaching 293 units, causing a stockout as it exceeded starting on-hand inventory (241). Over the last 4 periods (P9-P12), demand has averaged approximately 229 units (180, 209, 233, 293), with the latest figure suggesting the 'high growth' regime noted in the carry-over insights is continuing or accelerating. To prevent further lost sales and capture the seasonality, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 to capture this current elevated demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility observed during this seasonal ramp-up. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime in late spring: Demand averaged ~229 units from P9-P12, with a peak of 293 in P12, confirming continued seasonal pressure for sneaker socks.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which experiences peak demand during late spring and early summer as consumers transition to warmer weather footwear. Currently, it is mid-May (2019/5/13). Analysis of the last 5 periods (P9-P13) shows demand averaging 228.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 41.5 units. Despite a stockout in Period 12, Period 13 demand (227) settled near this 5-period average. Promised and actual lead times are consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical value q=0.5), I will use the recent 5-period demand regime to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This allows the OR engine to react to the current stabilized high-demand level without over-weighting the earlier spring surges or the initial low-demand baseline in Feb/March.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product (3p Sneaker Socks) is in high seasonal demand during the spring and early summer as consumers transition to low-cut footwear. Recent demand over the last four periods (P11-P14: 233, 293, 227, 212) has stabilized at a high level, averaging approximately 241 units per period. The lead time remains zero periods as confirmed by every transaction in the history including P14. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time. For the demand parameters mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent high-demand regime established in the last month. This N=4 window covers the period since late April, filtering out the volatility of early spring while ensuring we maintain enough inventory to meet the current sustained demand of ~241 units. Since profit (1.0) and holding cost (1.0) are equal, the OR backend will target a 50% service level which is appropriate for a high-volume, low-margin staple like socks.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019, which is late spring/early summer. The SKU (Sneaker Socks) is experiencing a high-demand seasonal regime. Demand in Period 15 reached 301, and the average demand over the last four periods (P12-P15) is approximately 258 units. The stockout in Period 15 (sold 242 vs demand 301) indicates that the previous base stock levels were insufficient for current volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels during this peak period while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (optimal service level around 50% but adjusted for current growth), I will use the last 4 periods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent surge (P12: 293, P13: 227, P14: 212, P15: 301) which reflects the current sustained late-spring demand level.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand seasonal peak for sneaker socks in late May: Period 15 demand reached 301 units, maintaining a 4-period average (P12-P15) of 258 units compared to the previous regime average of ~229.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442007' (Sneaker Socks) is in a high-demand seasonal peak as of early June. History shows that lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory has been stock-out prone over the last few weeks (P15 and P16 ending at 0 inventory due to demand exceeding supply). In Period 16, demand was 290 units, following 301 units in Period 15, confirming a sustained high-demand regime. The 5-period average (P12-P16) is approximately 264.6 units. Given the date (June 3rd) and the product type (hidden sneaker socks), we are in peak summer seasonality for this item. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this current high-demand level (approx 265 units/period). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to account for the recent volatility (212 to 301 range). Setting L=0 explicitly as the 14-period history confirms same-period arrival.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for early June (late spring/summer peak): 5-period average (P12-P16) is ~265 units. Inventory ended at 0 for two consecutive periods (P15-P16), indicating demand is still outpacing the current base stock calculated using longer history.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '3p Sneaker Socks' (a highly seasonal summer product) dropped sharply in Period 17 (98 units), following a sustained period of high demand (P12-P16 average of ~265). This drop occurring in early June suggests a potential cooling of the spring peak, although it could be a one-week anomaly. The 5-period average (P13-P17) including this drop is 225.6 units. Given the inventory-heavy 'ending on-hand' of 167 units and the high holding cost (equal to profit), it is prudent to adjust the base stock downward to reflect this most recent data point while still providing enough cushion for the season. Using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat will balance the recent low demand against the preceding high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed at Period 17: Demand dropped significantly to 98 units from a 4-period average of 258 units, signaling a potential end to the peak spring/early summer surge for sneaker socks.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a new lower regime as of Period 17 (June 3), following the peak spring/early summer season. Demand dropped from a 4-period average of 258 units to 98 units in P17 and 68 units in P18. This sharp decline aligns with seasonal transitions and is confirmed by the carry-over insight from the previous period. The current on-hand inventory is 158 units, which is quite high relative to the new demand levels. To avoid excessive holding costs in this new low-demand phase, I am selecting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this downward shift immediately. Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-peak demand average for P17-P18 is 83 units, a ~68% decrease from the late spring peak (avg 258). Transition to lower summer demand level for sneaker socks is established.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24. The demand for 3p Sneaker Socks has shifted from a high-spring peak (avg ~258) to a lower summer regime. The last three periods (P17, P18, P19) show demands of 98, 68, and 91 respectively. This confirms a sustained drop as identified in the carry-over insights. I will set N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent low-demand regime (mean ~86). Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived in same period), so L will remain at 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. With on-hand inventory at 67, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock for this lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime for sneaker socks stabilized: Period 17-19 average demand is 85.7 units, a significant and sustained drop from the spring peak average of ~258.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historical analysis confirms a major demand regime shift starting in Period 17 (June 3), where demand for sneaker socks dropped from a spring peak average of ~265 units to a summer average of ~99 units (Period 17-20: 98, 68, 91, 139). Period 20 showed a slight uptick (139), but still significantly lower than the spring peak. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are in the summer low-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand level while accounting for the recent slight increase. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected low summer demand without overstocking, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P20: 139, P21: 160) indicates a recovery from the sharp mid-June dip (P18: 68, P19: 91). This suggests the earlier 'summer low-demand' regime (avg ~86) was temporary or influenced by timing, and demand is now stabilizing closer to the mid-seasonal average. I am shifting the forecasting focus to the last 5 periods (P17-P21) which covers the transition from peak to current levels. This N=5 window captures the low points and the recent moderate recovery, giving a mean demand of approximately 111.2 units per period. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all history. Parameters L=0, mu_hat (N=5), and sigma_hat (N=5) will allow the system to adjust to this new intermediate demand level while staying responsive to further fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand recovery from June low: Post-peak demand recovered from an average of ~86 (P17-P19) to 149.5 (P20-P21), suggesting a stabilized summer regime higher than the initial drop.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has shown a significant recovery in July. After a low point in mid-June (avg ~86 units, P17-P19), demand has steadily increased for three consecutive periods: 139 (P20), 160 (P21), and 218 (P22). This suggests a summer demand resurgence, likely driven by hot weather or peak sandal/sneaker season. The 3-period average for this new regime is 172.3 units. In Period 22, we stocked out completely, selling only 112 units against a demand of 218. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this upward trend while buffering against the recent volatility (std dev of the last 3 periods is ~40), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to focus on the current July recovery regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand level and helps recover from recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand recovery in July: Demand increased for 3 consecutive periods (P20-P22) from 139 to 218, establishing a new summer regime average of 172.3 units (+100% vs mid-June low).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 3p Sneaker Socks shows a volatile pattern after the late spring peak. After a significant drop in mid-June (avg ~86, P17-P19), demand recovered to an average of ~172 units (P20-P22). However, Period 23 saw a sharp decline to 80 units, despite a previous upward trend. This suggests that the 'summer recovery' may be unstable or subject to high variance as we move deeper into July. The 'sneaker socks' product type typically sees sustained demand throughout summer, but the most recent data point (80) contradicts the recovery narrative noted in Period 23's carry-over insight. Given this uncertainty and the stockouts in P20-P22, I will transition to a more reactive forecasting method. Using EWMA with a higher gamma (0.5) will allow the forecast to weigh the most recent drop significantly while still accounting for the high demand seen earlier in July. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'arrived' history.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. This product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which is highly seasonal. History shows a major demand surge in spring (April-May), a sharp decline in June, a recovery in early July (reaching 218 units in P22), followed by a significant drop in late July (80 in P23 and 40 in P24). This suggests the secondary summer peak is ending. The last two periods (P23-P24) averaged 60 units, which is much lower than the P20-P22 average of 172 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this immediate late-summer cooldown. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to maintain enough safety stock for potential late summer volatility without excessive holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently high (91 units). Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 23: Demand dropped from a mid-summer average of 172 (P20-P22) to an average of 60 (P23-P24), signaling the end of the summer sneaker sock surge.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a highly volatile late-summer phase. After a significant drop in Periods 23-24 (avg 60), Period 25 saw a sudden resurgence to 135 units. Given that this product is highly seasonal and currently in August (2019/8/5), we are likely seeing idiosyncratic spikes or clearance-related demand. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while being cautious about building excess inventory during what is typically the end of the high season for this category, I will use a recent_N window for both demand and volatility. Specifically, N=3 captures the recent drop (60) and the recent spike (135), providing a balanced but responsive forecast for the current regime. Setting N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 allows the OR engine to react to the recent upward movement without overcommitting based on the much higher spring peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late July/early August: Period 25 demand (135) nearly doubled the average of the preceding two periods (60), signaling an unstable end-of-summer demand pattern.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks is currently showing late-summer volatility. Period 26 demand (196) significantly exceeded the previous 3-period average (~85) and the late-July dip (avg 60, P23-P24). We are observing a significant resurgence in demand as we enter mid-August, potentially driven by back-to-school shopping (sneaker socks are a high-volume staple). History shows many stockouts (ending inventory 0 in Periods 25 and 26), meaning actual demand is likely higher than sold units. I will prioritize the most recent 3 periods (P24-P26) to handle the upward trend while recognizing the high volatility (sigma_hat). Lead time is consistently 0. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the recent bounce back (avg ~124), and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat reflects the high variance (std ~80) to protect against further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: New demand resurgence detected in August: Period 26 demand (196) is over 100% higher than the P23-P25 average (85), likely signaling back-to-school seasonality for consumer basics like sneaker socks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P26-P27) shows a significant resurgence, with demand levels reaching 196 and 197 units respectively. This aligns with the 'back-to-school' seasonality for sneaker socks observed in previous carry-over insights. Prior to this, demand was highly volatile, dropping to as low as 40 in P24. The current mean of the last two periods (P26-P27) is 196.5. Given that both P26 and P27 resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), the true demand is likely higher than the 'sold' quantity of 124 units. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this new back-to-school regime. Since lead time is consistently 0, mu_hat represents the demand for (0+1) periods. I will set mu_hat to 205 to account for the stockouts and expected seasonal strength. sigma_hat is set to 25 to allow for a reasonable safety stock under this surging regime, as the OR backend balances a $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed: Period 26-27 demand averaged 196.5 units, a 130% increase over the P23-P25 average (85 units).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 160442007 (sneaker socks) remains in a back-to-school high-demand regime throughout August. Period 28 demand was 173 units, following values of 196 (P26) and 197 (P27), resulting in a 3-period average of 188.7. This confirms the 'back-to-school' surge noted in Carry-over insights is stable and significant. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To accurately capture this regime, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to mirror this specific August demand level (N=3 reflects the start of the surge at Period 26). This ensures the base stock calculation targets approx 189 units for the upcoming period, accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 32.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime stabilized in late August: 3-period average (P26-P28) is 188.7 units, representing a sustained shift from the early August average of 85.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from a mid-August back-to-school peak (averaging ~189 units from P26-P28) to a slightly lower but stable level in late August and early September. Period 29 demand was 150 units, following 173 in Period 28, indicating that the initial surge is plateauing as the main shopping season concludes. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since the current demand regime of ~150-170 units is lower than the previous threend, using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (averaging P27-P29: 197, 173, 150) would result in a mean of 173.3, which is a safe estimate for the tail end of the back-to-school season while preventing overstocking as we enter September. Sigma_hat using the same window captures the current volatility (std dev of ~23.5) to maintain appropriate safety stock. On-hand inventory is 39 units, and with L=0, the order will arrive in time to meet this period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand plateaued in late August: Demand decreased from 197 (P27) to 150 (P29), suggesting a stabilization around 150-170 units following the mid-August peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks is currently in a 'back-to-school' regime which began around Period 26 (August). Observed demand from P26 to P30 has been 196, 197, 173, 150, and 172. This period (Sept 9) marks the likely end of the immediate school-start surge and a transition into a stable autumn baseline. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 177.6 units with a standard deviation of 19.4. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the objective is to maintain enough stock for one period of demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this current regime while allowing for the slight downward trend seen after the peak. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on these last 5 periods will provide a base stock that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level at the base stock level, though the OR backend's cap ensures safety).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime (P26-P30) stabilized with an average of ~178 units, maintaining higher levels than the early-August low (85 units).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a late-summer/back-to-school surge. Period 31 demand (231) is significantly higher than the previous 5-period average (~178). As of September 16, we are in a high-demand phase likely driven by seasonal shifts before autumn. Lead time remains consistently 0. Since we ended Period 31 with 0 inventory despite an order of 176 units, we need to increase base stock to meet this higher demand regime. I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering Periods 26-31) to capture the back-to-school regime (average ~186.5) while giving weight to the most recent spike to 231. This ensures mu_hat reflects the stabilized higher level while sigma_hat captures the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge intensified in early September: Period 31 demand (231) is the highest since late May (P16), representing a ~30% increase over the late-August average of 178.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks is currently in a 'back-to-school' surge that has intensified since early September. Period 31 and 32 recorded demand of 231 and 210 units respectively, both significantly higher than the late August average of ~178. This indicates a sustained high-demand regime for the current 2019/9/23 date. Despite stockouts in Periods 31 and 32, which suggest demand is slightly outpacing supply, the lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this recent intensification without over-reacting to a potential late-September cooling, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (the period starting the intensifyed surge: P30-P32), which yields an average demand of (172+231+210)/3 = 204.3. Combined with a lead time factor of (1+L)=1, mu_hat should target ~204. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 to capture the volatility of the entire back-to-school window (P28-P32).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge sustained through mid-September: P31-P32 demand averaged 220.5 units, a 24% increase over the late-August baseline, confirming a late-season peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 160442007 (sneaker socks) experienced a massive surge in Period 33, reaching 369 units, which is significantly higher than the previous back-to-school peak of 231 (P31). This indicates that the back-to-school/early autumn peak is much stronger than initially estimated. With lead time consistently confirmed at 0 periods, the objective is to satisfy this high demand level while managing the risk of a sudden drop-off as seen in previous transitions (e.g., Period 17). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Given the recent trend (P31: 231, P32: 210, P33: 369), the last 3 periods provide the most relevant 'high-demand' signal (Average: 270). I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this intense volatility and volume, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers this elevated demand immediately.

Carry-over insight: Intense demand surge in late September: Period 33 demand (369 units) is a ~67% increase over the P31-P32 average (220.5), signaling a late-September peak for sneaker socks.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks exhibited an intense peak in late September (Period 33 demand: 369), which appears to have passed as Period 34 demand moderated to 249. While still high compared to early August, this suggests we have moved past the absolute maximum of the late-season surge. The 4-period average (P31-P34) is approximately 265 units, but given the drop from 369 to 249, I will use an N=4 average to anchor the forecast (approx 265) which conservatively balances the recent high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (21 units), so a robust order is needed to meet sustained demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderated in late September/early October: Period 34 demand (249) dropped from the Period 33 peak (369), suggesting the absolute peak of the autumn surge has passed, stabilizing at a high-demand level (~260 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks is currently in a post-back-to-school phase. After hitting a peak of 369 in Period 33 (late September), demand has moderated over the last two periods to 249 and 185, suggesting the autumn surge is subsiding. We are now in mid-October. Historically, sneaker socks (low-cut) face a seasonal decline as weather cools. The last two periods (P34-P35) average 217 units, while the peak 5-period average (P31-P35) is 248.8. Given the clear downward trend from the 369 peak, I will use a recent_N approach with N=3 (P33-P35) for mu_hat to capture this transition while maintaining enough buffer for potential volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 (P31-P35) to capture the higher volatility experienced during the September surge. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation confirmed in mid-October: Demand dropped from a late-September peak of 369 to 185 in Period 35 (-50%), signaling the conclusion of the back-to-school/autumn surge.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks is cooling as we move into mid-October. Period 35 demand was 185 and Period 36 was 145, confirming a clear downward trend from the late-September peak (369 in P33 and 249 in P34). The current 'back-to-school' surge has concluded, and we are entering a lower-demand autumn regime. For Period 37, I am using recent_N with N=3 to capture this immediate deceleration (P34-P36 average is 193), which better reflects the current cooling trend than the longer-term average. Lead time is consistently 0. With an on-hand inventory of 123, the OR backend will calculate a base stock against this lower mean and adjust the order accordingly to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed mid-October: Demand dropped from a late-September peak (avg ~300) to an average of 165 units over P35-P36 (-45%), signaling the end of the autumn surge for sneaker socks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 160442007 (sneaker socks) has shifted from an autumn peak (avg ~260) to a more moderate level following the back-to-school surge. Period 37 demand was 191, which is higher than the previous two periods (avg 165) but still well below the late-September peak. In Period 37, the order of 70 units combined with existing on-hand inventory (123) barely covered demand (191), leaving only 2 units on-hand. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while adjusting to this post-peak regime, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (P35-P37) to capture the current stabilization around 174 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. This approach balances high service levels for a seasonal basic with the risk of holding excess inventory as demand cools toward November.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand regime for sneaker socks (late Oct) stabilized at an average of 173.6 units (P35-P37), a significant reduction from the late-September peak of ~260.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 160442007 (Sneaker Socks) is now in a post-autumn demand regime (late October/early November). The massive back-to-school/autumn surge (which peaked at 369 units in P33) has subsided. For the last four periods (P35-P38), demand has been relatively stable, averaging 175.5 units (185, 145, 191, 181). This is significantly lower than the P31-P34 peak but much higher than the mid-summer lows. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 38 due to demand (181) slightly exceeding available stock (174). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new stabilized average and use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility around this mean, ensuring we satisfy demand while avoiding excessive holding costs as we move further into the shoulder season.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a post-autumn demand phase for sneaker socks. Historical data and the recent carry-over insights show that demand has moderated significantly from the late-September peak (369 units). The average demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) is 161.2 units (185, 145, 191, 181, 104). The most recent observation (P39: 104 units) indicates a potential further cooling as we approach winter, which is logically a low season for low-cut sneaker socks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility in October, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current moderated regime (~160 units) rather than the long-term history which includes the massive September and Spring surges.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation continued into November: P39 demand (104) is the lowest since early August, confirming a transition to a lower winter volume regime for sneaker socks.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. This product, 3-pack sneaker socks, is highly seasonal. We are currently in a lower-demand winter regime following the peak seasons of spring and back-to-school (September). Since Period 39, demand has significantly moderated, with the last two periods showing demand of 104 and 120 units respectively. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P38-P40) is 135 units, which is a clear step down from the autumn surge (avg ~260). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N approach (N=3) to focus on the current November demand level.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime confirmed: Demand for sneaker socks has averaged 135 units over P38-P40, a ~50% decrease from the late-September/autumn peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are firmly in the winter low-demand regime for sneaker socks. Historical demand over the last three periods (P39-P41) has been 104, 120, and 107 units, respectively, yielding an average of approximately 110 units. This is a significant decrease from the autumn peak and even the post-autumn stabilization (~173 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this low-volume period and minimize holding costs, I am transitioning the demand forecast (mu_hat) to a recent_N method with N=3 to capture this specific winter level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will use these values to maintain a base stock that aligns with the current run rate of ~110 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime (Nov) stabilized: Average demand for P39-P41 is 110.3 units, a 36% decrease from the late-October average (173.6 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand for sneaker socks spiked unexpectedly to 311 units, significantly higher than the previous winter volume regime average of ~110 units (P39-P41). This surge likely correlates with Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional activities or a pre-holiday retail peak for basic consumer goods. Given this sharp reversal of the downward winter trend, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to a very short 'recent_N' window (N=3) to quickly adjust to this high-demand signal while balancing it against the preceding lower weeks. Sigma_hat is also set to a short window (N=3) to account for the heightened volatility introduced by this spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. This strategy aims to prevent stockouts during the early December shopping period while acknowledging the extreme variability of the most recent observation.

Carry-over insight: Sudden demand spike in late November (Period 42): Demand jumped to 311 units, nearly 3x the average of the preceding three periods (110 units), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 311 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) and then dropped back to 107 in Period 43. This confirms the spike was a transient event. Excluding the spike, the recent winter regime (P39-P41 and P43) shows a stable average demand of 109.5 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-spike stabilization while ignoring the anomalous outlier. This ensures we don't over-order based on a one-time holiday peak while maintaining adequate stock for the current lower-volume winter period.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday demand moderated immediately (from 311 to 107), confirming the spike was transient. Winter volume is stable at ~110 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). The product, 3p Sneaker Socks, has passed its primary seasonal peaks (spring/summer and back-to-school) and the transient Black Friday surge (P42 demand: 311). Demand has since moderated to a stable winter regime. Period 43 demand was 107 and Period 44 was 88. The 3-period average (P41, P43, P44), excluding the P42 spike, is 100.6 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods across all concluded intervals. Given the proximity to the December holidays, demand for consumer basics like socks often remains steady or slightly declines after the major gift-buying peaks. I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the post-spike stabilization while excluding the outlier, and a larger N for sigma_hat (N=5) to account for recent volatility caused by the Black Friday event.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime stabilized post-Black Friday: Excluding the P42 spike, demand for P43-P44 averaged 97.5 units, alignining with the pre-spike November average of ~110 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-holiday/Christmas week. Historically, after the Black Friday surge (P42), demand for sneaker socks has stabilized in a 'winter low' regime. The average demand for the last three periods (P43-P45) is 99.33 units, which is consistent with the pre-Black Friday November average of ~110. While there is a slight possibility of last-minute gift-buying demand, sneaker socks in this configuration are more utility-driven and seasonal to warmer weather. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-surge winter demand level, as the regime has been consistent for three weeks following the transient spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Historical data and the product description (sneaker socks) indicate that demand is currently in a stable winter low-volume regime. Excluding the transient Black Friday spike in Period 42 (311 units), demand from Period 43 to Period 46 has averaged 109.3 units (107, 88, 103, 139). The slight increase in Period 46 (139) is likely a minor year-end/holiday effect but remains within the winter volume expectations. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded messages. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (P43-P46) to capture this stable winter baseline while accounting for the recent minor uptick, and sigma_hat will be calculated over the same period to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will aim for a high service level due to the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (q=0.5, z*=0).

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime (Dec) stabilized: Average demand for P43-P46 is 109.3 units, maintaining consistency with the pre-Black Friday November baseline (~110 units) despite a minor holiday uptick in P46.
