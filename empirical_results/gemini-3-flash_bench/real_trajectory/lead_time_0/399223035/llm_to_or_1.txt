Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a denim item for women. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a clear upward trend: 57, 73, 88, 73, 96. The average of these 5 samples is 77.4. Given the item is a denim staple, demand is relatively stable but shows growth. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, the backend will target a base stock to cover the current period's demand. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the expected demand for 1 period. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand levels while smoothing out the slight dip in late January. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. No previous history of arrivals exists yet, so L is set to 'default'.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 concluded with a demand of 156 units, which is significantly higher than the 5-week pre-game training data average (77.4) and the most recent sample (96). This indicates an immediate demand spike for this SKU (Jeggings) starting in mid-February, possibly due to a seasonal shift or promotion. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, as the Period 1 order arrived in the same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and demand for Period 1 was double the recent average, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (including the high Period 1 value and the two highest previous samples) to capture this upward momentum and ensure the stock levels cover the current high-demand regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. Looking at the history, this SKU (Jeggings) has experienced high demand (156 in P1, 124 in P2) compared to the initial historical average of ~77 units. This represents a significant upward regime shift, likely due to seasonal spring fashion trends. In both P1 and P2, we stocked out (ending inventory 0) despite ordering based on standard logic, meaning demand is consistently exceeding supply. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I will use an explicit mu_hat forecast. I'll estimate demand at roughly 140 units (averaging recent highs) and set sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility to ensure a higher service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Average demand increased from ~77 to ~140 (+80%) as spring denim season begins.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4 (2019-03-04), demand exhibits a significant regime shift. The initial historical average was ~77 units, but since Period 1 (2019-02-11), demand surged to 156 and 124 units before dipping to 76 in Period 3. This matches the 'spring denim season' identified in carry-over insights. Total inventory currently stands at 64 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (confirmed by Periods 1, 2, and 3 concludes). Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 (the median). Given the high volatility observed in the new regime (demands of 156, 124, 76), I will use the recent 3 periods (Period 1-3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current demand level (~119 avg) while accounting for the high coefficient of variation to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 1 and 2.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223035 (Jeggings) is entering the spring season. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1-4. Initial demand spiked to 156 and 124 in Periods 1-2, but has since cooled to 76 and 64 in Periods 3-4. The mean demand for the last 4 periods is 105. Given the high stockout occurrences in Periods 1 and 2 (where sold units were limited by inventory), the early 'spring denim season' insight remains valid, but demand is currently on a downward trend from that peak. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the volatility of this spring transition while accounting for the lower recent demand. Keeping L=0 as promised and observed.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019-03-18), we are managing SKU 399223035 (Ladies Denim Jeggings). The historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the last 5 completed periods. Since the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11), demand shifted from a pre-game average of ~77 to a more volatile regime. While the carry-over insight noted a spike in Periods 1-2 (avg 140), demand in Periods 3-5 has stabilized at a lower mean (avg 71). Specifically, the last three periods (P3-P5) showed demands of 76, 64, and 72. Given this stabilization at the lower level, I will use recent_N=3 for the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters to reflect this current demand cluster rather than the earlier spikes. This approach aims to reduce holding costs (as Profit=HoldingCost=$1.0, the target service level is 50%) while maintaining enough inventory for immediate (L=0) satisfaction.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~71 units/period between P3 and P5 (2019-02-25 to 2019-03-11) after the initial Feb spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019-03-18), we experienced a stockout (sold 71, demand 92), ending with 0 inventory. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as every order placed has arrived within the same period. Historically, demand for this item (Jeggings) showed a spike in P1 (156) and P2 (124), followed by a stabilization period (P3-P5: avg 71). However, Period 6 saw a 28% increase in demand (92 units) compared to that stabilized average, potentially indicating a late March uptick as spring fashion peaks. To prevent further stockouts while inventory is at 0, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use 'recent_N' with N=4 (covering P3-P6) to better reflect current demand volatility and recent levels (ave ~76) without being overly reactive to the early February outliers. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased variance seen lately.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing late March: P6 demand (92) exceeded the previous 3-period average (71) by 30%.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU 399223035 (Jeggings) is entering the peak spring season. Looking at history, demand has spiked significantly over the last two weeks: P6 was 92 and P7 was 130. This confirms the 'demand volatility increasing' insight from Period 7. Promised lead time remains 0 and arrivals have consistently been same-period (L=0). However, the on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we experienced stockouts in both Period 6 (sold 71 of 92 demand) and Period 7 (sold 76 of 130 demand). To account for the recent surge and prevent further lost sales, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime of [92, 130], resulting in an average demand of 111 per period. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend service level target is 50%; using the recent volatility ensures we hold enough to cover these higher peaks without excessive overstocking as the season progresses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late March/early April: demand average has increased from ~71 to ~111 (+56%) over the last two periods (P6-P7), likely driven by spring fashion cycles.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019-04-08). Reviewing history, actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has shown significant volatility recently: P6 (92), P7 (130), and P8 (113). The average demand over these last 3 periods is ~111.7, which aligns with the regime shift identified in the Period 8 carry-over insight (+56% increase for spring denim). We are currently stocked out (ending on-hand 0 for three consecutive periods), meaning we are losing potential profit. To capture the elevated spring demand and account for high recent volatility (std dev of P6-P8 is ~19), I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the current high-demand regime and use default sigma_hat calculation which will incorporate the recent fluctuations. Since profit/holding cost is equal (1.0/1.0), the service level q will be 0.5, directing the backend to target the median demand.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand for the last four periods (P6 to P9) has been 92, 130, 113, and 107, yielding a mean of 110.5 units per period. This confirms a sustained demand regime shift from the earlier average of ~71 units. The product (Jeggings) is in its peak spring season. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all history. In-transit is 0 and on-hand inventory is low at 5 units. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, but since the OR backend uses a capped policy that incorporates a 95% service level buffer and the lead time is 0, the base stock will closely follow mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 110.5 (rounded to capture the 4-period mean) and use sigma_hat from the same period to account for the recent volatility seen in late March/early April.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~111 units/period (P6-P9 average is 110.5) following the spring fashion shift identified in Period 8.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd, 2019. This product is 'Ladies Denim Jeggings', which is entering a peak spring season. Historical demand data shows a regime shift in late March (Period 6 onwards). Over the last five periods (P6 to P10), the mean demand is 105.6 units (92, 130, 113, 107, 86). Although Period 10 saw a slight dip to 86, the overall average since the shift remains high. The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time observations (P1-P10) consistently confirm that shipments arrive within the same period (L=0). There are 0 units in-transit and 25 units on-hand. To capture the current demand regime and account for spring seasonality, I will use the recent 5 periods (P6-P10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a mean of ~106 and a standard deviation that accounts for the volatility seen in periods 6 and 7. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the expected 106 units for the current period, adjusting for the 25 units currently on hand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for Jeggings (Skinny denim) has remained relatively stable following the spring fashion shift identified around P8. Over the last five periods (P7-P11), observed demand values were 130, 113, 107, 86, and 104, resulting in a mean of 108 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), which I will continue to use. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), meaning the OR backend will aim for the median demand. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging ~108) while excluding the lower-demand periods from early March. This ensures the system covers the likely 100-110 units expected for the turn of the month.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further between late March and late April (P7-P11): average demand is ~108 units/period, showing consistency in the spring fashion cycle.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019-05-06. Looking at the history, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. The product 'Jeggings H.W' is in high demand during the spring season. Historical demand since Period 7 (the current regime) has been high and somewhat volatile (130, 113, 107, 86, 104, 140). The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 113.3. In Period 12, there was a stock-out where demand was 140 but only 108 units were sold. To avoid further stock-outs occurring in May, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the demand mean and variance of this spring regime. Given that Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the OR backend will target a 50% service level (z=0) by default, but the capped policy will help maintain a buffer. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods of data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in Period 12: demand spiked to 140, resulting in a stock-out. Average demand since P7 (start of spring regime) is ~113 units/period.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223035 (Jeggings) is currently in a spring/early summer demand regime. History shows a shift occurred around Period 7 (late March), with demand averaging approximately 111 units from Period 7 to Period 13 (samples: 130, 113, 107, 86, 104, 140, 97). The last two periods show high volatility (140 then 97). Given the current holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level; however, because we have consistently experienced stock-outs or near-zero ending inventory in recent periods (P12 stock-out, P11 ending inventory 2), I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this 'spring' regime mean of ~111. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 18.5) seen in this recent window. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223035 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) is currently in the late spring fashion cycle (late May). Analysis of the last 8 periods (Period 7-14) shows a stable but high-demand regime with an average of 114.25 units/period (ranging from 86 to 140). Recent demand in Period 14 was 137, following a stock-out situation. Current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages. Given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. I am setting L to default (0), and mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current spring regime average of ~114 units. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the observed volatility in this period (std dev approximately 19). This provides a base stock that covers the expected demand while minimizing excessive holding costs in a high-cost environment.

Carry-over insight: Spring denim regime (P7-P14) average confirmed at 114 units/period with standard deviation of ~19.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-27, which is nearing the end of the spring fashion season and heading into summer. Historical demand analysis shows that the spring 'Lady Denim' regime (P7-P15) has been consistent, with an average demand of approximately 117 units/period (Calculated from P7-P15: 130, 113, 107, 86, 104, 140, 97, 137, 128). Last period's demand (128) and the high demand in P14 (137) suggest that demand remains strong and volatile. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the entirety of this stabilized spring regime (P7-P15). This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while accounting for the recent high-demand peaks (140, 137, 128).

Carry-over insight: Spring denim demand regime (P7-P15) further refined: average demand is ~117 units/period with continued high volatility (multiple demand peaks >130).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019-06-03. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order from P1 to P16 arriving within the same period. The product (Ladies Denim Jeggings) is in the middle of a sustained spring/early summer demand regime. Since Period 7 (2019-03-25), demand has averaged 114.9 units (approx. 115) with a standard deviation of approximately 19.5. The most recent demand in Period 16 (102) is slightly below the regime average but within one standard deviation. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50, meaning the base stock should target the median demand to minimize the sum of lost sales and holding costs. I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) covering the stable spring regime and use the recent standard deviation to capture current volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223035 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) is currently in a stable spring/early summer regime. Analysis of demand since Period 7 (start of the spring fashion cycle) shows an average demand of approximately 115 units per period. The last five periods (P13-P17) exhibit a similar mean of 115.2 units with significant volatility (highs of 137/140 and lows around 102). In the most recent period (P17), demand was 112, following 102 in P16, suggesting the demand remains within the established 110-120 range. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while balancing holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs. Holding $1.0), I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering the periods from P7 to P17) to capture the variance and mean of the current spring regime without being overly influenced by the initial Feb spike or early low-demand periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-06-17. The SKU 399223035 is a spring-summer denim item (jeggings). Historical data from Period 7 (2019-03-25) to Period 18 (2019-06-10) shows a very stable demand regime associated with the spring/early summer season. During this window (P7-P18), the average demand is approximately 114.2 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Recent demand in the last three periods (P16: 102, P17: 112, P18: 114) aligns perfectly with this average. The promised lead time is 0, and empirical evidence from all concluded periods confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median of the demand distribution to balance stockout and holding costs. I will use the recent regime (P7-P18, N=12) to calculate the parameters.

Carry-over insight: Spring/Early Summer demand regime (March 25 - June 10) confirmed stable at ~114 units/period with standard deviation ~18.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is 'Jeggings in washed, superstretch denim', which has shown a stable demand regime since late March (Period 7). The spring/early summer regime (Periods 7-19) has an average demand of approximately 114 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 18. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. The inventory position currently has 28 units on-hand. The OR backend uses a 50% service level target (z*=0) because profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), aiming to target the mean demand. I will use the established recent regime (N=13, from Period 7 to 19) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this sustained pattern while maintaining the default lead time of 0.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223035' (Ladies' denim jeggings) is entering July, a period where demand for heavy denim often softens compared to the spring peak. The historical demand data shows a significant drop over the last two weeks: Demand fell from a steady 114 (avg) to 87 in Period 19 and then to 54 in Period 20 (a -53% drop from the spring average). This indicates a regime shift out of the spring/early summer cycle. The current on-hand inventory is 59 units, which is already higher than the most recent demand (54). To prevent excess holding costs while maintaining a 50% service level (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0 results in a critical ratio of 0.5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent sharp decline (Periods 18-20: 114, 87, 54; mean=85). Standard deviation (sigma_hat) will also use N=3 to reflect the current high volatility during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 19 (mid-June): Demand for denim jeggings has dropped significantly from a spring average of ~114 to a recent average of ~85 units/period (-25%), with the most recent period at 54.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P19-P21) shows a clear downward shift from the spring average (~114) to a lower summer regime. Demand in the last three periods was 87, 54, and 76, averaging 72.3 units. This aligns with the seasonal transition for denim jeggings as temperatures rise in July. The stock-out in P21 suggests that the drastic order reduction to 26 units in P21 was overly aggressive, as demand (76) outstripped arrival + start inventory (85, but only 26 new units). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new, lower demand level (avg ~72) while ensuring enough safety stock to prevent further stock-outs. The lead time L is set to calculated as there is no evidence of divergence from the 0-period promise. This strategy balances lower seasonal demand with the need to recover from the current low on-hand inventory (9).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (starting mid-June, P19): average demand decreased from ~114 to ~72 units/period (-36%) as of Period 21.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are currently in a summer demand regime for high-waisted jeggings, which started around Period 19 (mid-June). Demand has dropped significantly from the spring peak (~114) to a recent average of approximately 75 units per period. Specifically, demand in the last four periods (P19-P22) has been 87, 54, 76, and 84, giving an average of 75.25. The stock-out in Period 22 (sold 73 against 84 demand) confirms that our previous order was slightly too low for the current volatility. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture this lower summer average while maintaining sensitivity to recent demand levels. Lead time (L) consistently remains at 0 periods, as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 4 periods to account for the current demand variability. The backend OR engine will target a 50% service level because Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), which is appropriate given the relatively stable but lower summer demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223035 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) has stabilized into a summer regime. Following the drop in mid-June (Period 19), demand has consistently averaged 78 units per period over the last five weeks (P19-P23: 87, 54, 76, 84, 89). The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and history confirms orders consistently arrive in the same period (Actual L=0), I will set L to 'default'. For demand forecasting, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture this current stable summer average of approx 78 units. Given the recent stock-outs (P22, P23) and high volatility (standard deviation of approx 14 in this 5-period window), I will also set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the current level of uncertainty and maintains a sufficient service level.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (starting P19) stabilized over P19-P23 with an average of 78 units/period and a standard deviation of approximately 14.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P25 (2019-07-29). We are in a summer demand regime that began around P19 (mid-June). In the last 6 periods (P19-P24), demand has been: 87, 54, 76, 84, 89, 38. This averages approximately 71.3 units/period, showing a significant drop from the spring average of ~114 and continued high volatility (standard deviation ~20). The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. Inventory health check: We have 40 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. For Period 25, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this lower summer demand regime and its associated volatility. This will ensure we maintain a sufficient base stock for the 0-period lead time while minimizing holding costs as we late-July/early-August.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223035 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) is currently in a summer demand regime that began around mid-June (Period 19). Analyzing the most recent demand data from P19 to P25 (87, 54, 76, 84, 89, 38, 53), the average demand has dropped to approximately 68.7 units per period. This represents a significant decrease from the spring average of ~114. The most recent two periods (P24-P25) have been particularly low (38 and 53), averaging 45.5, which may suggest a further late-summer dip or just high volatility within the current low regime. Inventory is currently at 19 units on-hand with nothing in-transit. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (Std Dev ~19 in this regime), I will use the recent_N method based on the 7 periods of the summer regime (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set the base stock to cover the current period's expected demand and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P19-P25) mean is confirmed at ~69 units/period, significantly lower than the spring average of 114 (-40%).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the summer demand regime for high-waisted denim jeggings. Analyzing the history since Period 19 (mid-June), demand has consistently remained lower than the spring average. The most recent demand samples are 87, 54, 76, 84, 89, 38, 53, and 54. The mean of these summer samples (P19-P26) is approximately 67 units, with a standard deviation of about 18. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To optimize for the current regime, I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering the data since the regime shift at P19) to align with the current lower demand level while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223035 (Jeggings) is currently in a summer demand regime that began around Period 19 (mid-June). The average demand from Period 19 to Period 27 is approximately 70 units per period, which is a significant drop from the spring average of 114. However, Period 27 observed a demand of 79, which is slightly above the recent average but aligns with the standard deviation observed in this regime (approx. 14-18 units). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. As we are in mid-August, we should monitor for potential 'Back to School' or early autumn shifts, but currently, the data supports maintaining the summer regime parameters. I will use recent_N with N=9 (P19-P27) to capture the current mean and volatility of this regime accurately.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The product is Ladies' Denim Jeggings, which has been in a 'Summer' demand regime since mid-June (Period 19). For the period P19 to P28, the average demand is 67.5 units per period. Recent performance shows slightly higher demand in the last two weeks (79 and 61) compared to the mid-regime lows, suggesting a stabilized floor for the pre-fall transition. On-hand inventory is 8 units and there are no in-transit orders. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To calculate the OR parameters, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the entire summer regime (P19-P28), which provides a stable mean of approximately 68 units and accounts for recent volatility. This will set a base stock level sufficient to cover the expected demand for the current period while balancing the high holding cost (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% service level target, which the base stock logic adjusts).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P19-P28) stabilized with an average of ~68 units/period and consistent 0-period lead time.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Historically, for this product (denim jeggings), demand saw a major shift in mid-June (Period 19), entering a 'Summer' regime with lower average demand (~68-70 units/period). However, as we enter September, we must anticipate the 'Back-to-School' and 'Fall' fashion transition. Looking at recent trends, Period 28 saw demand of 61 and Period 29 saw 45. While these are still within the summer range, historical startup data from early Feb suggest demand can quickly escalate to over 100 units. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the OR engine targets a 50% service level (q = 0.5), meaning base_stock will target the mean demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid stock-outs during a potential September uptick while not overstocking, I will use recent_N with N=11 (covering the stable summer regime since P19) to set parameters, as there is no statistical evidence of a Fall spike yet, but I must remain responsive.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in the summer demand regime for this SKU (Jeggings), which has been stable since Period 19 (late June). Demand for the last 12 periods (P19-P30) has averaged approximately 69.5 units per period with a standard deviation of about 17.6. Recently (P26-P30), demand has remained consistent with this regime: 54, 79, 61, 45, 53 (average ~58). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To capture the recent slightly lower average within the summer regime while maintaining safety stock for volatility, I will use a recent window of N=12 periods (P19-P30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the overall summer trend while being responsive to the recent weeks. L is set to calculate as it reliably mirrors the promised 0-period lead time.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical data (P19-P31) shows a stabilized summer demand regime with an average of approximately 65-70 units per period. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 79, 61, 45, 53, 66, which averages 60.8 units. The period 31 demand of 66 units indicates the item is consistently clearing inventory when lead time is 0. Since the transition into autumn/winter is approaching for 'Ladies Denim Jeggings', I will monitor for a potential regime shift. For now, I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current stable summer trend while remaining sensitive to fluctuations. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history, so I will continue to use the calculated average.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223035 (Jeggings) is entering late September (Period 33). Historically, the summer demand regime (Periods 19-32) has maintained a stable average of approximately 65 units per period. The last five periods (P28-P32) demand values were 61, 45, 53, 66, and 64, yielding an average of 57.8. While fashion items often experience a 'Back-to-School' or 'Fall transition' spike, there is no significant evidence of this occurring yet in the observed data. Therefore, I am maintaining parameters aligned with the established summer-to-fall transition average. I will use a recent window of N=14 (Periods 19-32) to capture the full stability of the current lower-demand regime while allowing for recent volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to demand slightly exceeding stock in the last two periods, requiring a target that covers the immediate upcoming demand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand for Jeggings (Ladies Denim) has shown a significant recent uptick: from the summer average of ~68 units (P19-P30), demand reached 66 units in P31, 64 in P32, and spiked to 97 in Period 33. This suggests the end of the summer low-demand regime and the start of a fall/autumn demand shift, likely driven by cooler weather and seasonal shopping. Demand in P33 was ~45% higher than the previous 5-period average (67 units). To account for this transition, I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat to capture the upward momentum (P31-P33 average is ~76). I will increase the sigma_hat window slightly to capture the volatility associated with this regime shift. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 33 (late September): demand increased from a summer average of ~68 to 97 units (+42%), signaling the start of the fall season.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (late September), demand spiked to 97 units, signaling the start of a fall demand regime. However, Period 34 saw a lower demand of 48 units. Given the product category (jeggings) and the calendar (October), we expect demand to be higher than the summer average and potentially volatile as fall fashion cycles take hold. The summer regime (P19-P32) averaged ~68 units. The last two periods (P33-P34) together average 72.5 units, but this includes a significant peak followed by a dip. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 90 units to anticipate a sustained increase in fall demand while accounting for recent volatility, and use a recent_N of 3 for sigma_hat to capture this increased variance. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223035 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) transitioned from a summer demand regime (avg ~68) to a fall regime starting around Period 33 (late September). While Period 33 saw a spike to 97 units, the subsequent periods (P34 and P35) have shown lower demand (48 and 45 units respectively). This suggests the initial spike might have been a temporary restocking or early-season peak, and the current 'fall' mean is lower than expected or the market is currently soft. However, given the product type (denim jeggings) and the October date, a secondary peak for late autumn/early winter is possible. On-hand inventory is currently 45 units. The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time has consistently been 0. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the most recent three weeks of fall demand (97, 48, 45), yielding an average of 63.3 units per period (126.6 for 1+L). This balances the high P33 with the lower P34-35. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility seen in the transition (std ~29).

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (starting P33) initially spiked but has averaged ~63 units/period over the first 3 weeks (P33-P35), lower than the initial burst of 97.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late fall season (Period 37). Based on the carry-over insights and recent history, the 'fall demand spike' mentioned in Period 34 (97 units) was short-lived. Demand over the last three periods (P34-P36) has been significantly lower: 48, 45, and 41 units respectively. This suggests a new stabilization or a downward trend as we move further into October. The average demand for these last three periods is approximately 45 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Inventory currently stands at 23 units on-hand. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (Profit and Holding cost are equal at $1.0, implying a 50% target service level for the base stock calculation, though the OR engine's cap provides a buffer), I will set the demand mean (mu_hat) based on the most recent 4 periods (P33-P36) to capture the trend change, which averages 57.75 units. Sigma will be calculated from the same window to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 34: Fall demand has settled significantly lower than the initial burst. Recent 3-period average (P34-P36) is 44.7 units, compared to the summer average of ~68.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in a confirmed fall demand regime for high-waisted jeggings. Since the initial fall spike in late September (Period 33 demand 97), demand has significantly dropped and stabilized at a much lower level. Looking at the last four periods (P34-P37), demand values were 48, 45, 41, and 56 respectively. This represents a sustained regime with an average of 47.5 units per period. The Carry-over insight from Perod 37 correctly identified this shift. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high stock-out risk seen in previous spikes but also the holding cost being equal to profit ($1.00), the OR backend's service level target (50%) will aim to keep inventory close to the mean demand. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current low-demand fall regime and ensure mu_hat reflect the recent average of ~48 units.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (starting P34) confirmed stable at a lower level: avg demand ~48 units/period (P34-P37), down from summer's ~68.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223035 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) is currently in a fall demand regime, which was previously stabilized around 48 units/period. However, Period 38 saw a significant demand spike to 78 units, exceeding the recent average by over 60%. This spike occurred in late October, potentially signaling early pre-holiday shopping or weather-driven demand. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to this spike. To address this, I am selecting a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to include the recent spike while still being anchored to the fall baseline (P34-P38: 48, 45, 41, 56, 78). This results in a mu_hat calculation based on an average of 53.6 units/period. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, so I will maintain the default. Given the increased volatility (standard deviation has risen with the 78 demand point), I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to ensure the base stock covers this potential upward trend without excessive overstocking, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a 50% service level target (z*=0) from the OR backend's perspective.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 38 (Date: 2019/10/28) with demand rising to 78 units, compared to the previous 4-period fall average of 47.5 (+64%).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, approaching the peak holiday season. Demand for denim jeggings has shown relative instability in the 'Fall' regime (starting Period 34), with a recent spike to 78 units in P38 and 58 units in P39, compared to the earlier late-September/October average of ~48 units. Given the proximity to late November and historical patterns in retail (Holiday/Black Friday prep), I expect demand to continue trending upward or at least stabilize at a higher level than the early fall slump. The 2-period average (P38-P39) is 68 units/period, which aligns exactly with the previous summer regime but is higher than the early fall average. To capture this upward trend while protecting against inventory risk, I'll use a recent 3-period average for demand (covering P37-P39: 56, 78, 58) which averages 64 units/period. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) allows the OR backend to quickly adapt to this late-fall volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in early November: Average demand for P38-P39 increased to 68 units/period (+41% vs early fall average of 48), suggesting holiday season buildup.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are entering the peak holiday shopping season. Historical demand for this SKU (Jeggings) showed a volatility increase in late October/early November (P38-P39), with demand reaching 78 and 58 units. Period 40 saw a dip to 40 units, but with Black Friday and the holiday surge approaching, current demand levels reflect a higher baseline than the early fall average. The last 3 periods (P38-P40) average 58.7 units. Given the seasonality of denim and the upcoming retail peak, I will use a recent window of N=3 to capture the most current holiday buildup trend while remaining sensitive to recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the lead-up to the holiday season (Black Friday and December). Demand in early to mid-November (P40-P41) has been lower than the late-October spike, averaging 40.5 units/period. However, the carry-over insight from Period 40 noted a broader increase in demand volatility and a higher average (68 units) during the initial buildup (P38-P39). Given the item is 'Jeggings in washed, superstretch denim'\u2014a popular holiday gift and winter staple\u2014I anticipate a significant demand spike for the upcoming week (Period 42) due to Black Friday (Nov 29). The recent 4-period fall/holiday-buildup average (P38-P41) is 54.25 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~17). I will use recent_N=4 to capture this current regime, which provides a base mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect the recent upward pressure while allowing the OR backend to handle the high service level requirements (q=0.5 but capped policy usually favors higher stock in volatile periods). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223035 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) showed a significant increase in the last period (Period 42), reaching 90 units compared to an average of ~46 units in the preceding three periods (P39-P41). This spike, occurring in late November, aligns with the holiday shopping season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Although the early November average was approximately 68, the seasonality suggests higher volatility and a shift toward increased demand. The current inventory is zero. To capture this holiday trend while mitigating stock-out risk, I am selecting a recent demand window of 5 periods (P38-P42), which includes the late October increase and the recent peak. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on an average of (78+58+40+41+90)/5 = 61.4. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the entire game history.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected in late November (Period 42): demand increased to 90 units, compared to an average of 46 units in the preceding three periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (2019/12/09), deep in the December holiday season. Historical analysis shows a significant demand surge in late November (P42: 90 units) followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (19 units). This drop is likely a temporary correction or timing issue before the peak holiday weeks. Given the product is 'Ladies Denim Jeggings', demand is expected to remain elevated through mid-December for holiday shopping. The previous regime average during the holiday buildup (P38-P42) was approximately 61 units/period. I will use an N=5 recent window for mu_hat to capture this holiday trend while balancing the recent outlier drop. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the current high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has been highly volatile over the last few periods: a surge to 90 (P42) followed by a sharp drop to 19 (P43) and 26 (P44). Based on previous carry-over insights, the holiday demand surge for these jeggings (Ladies Denim) was detected in late November. We are likely transitioning past the peak shopping window for this SKU. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the recent downward trend in the last two weeks, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the period from early November P40 to now) to capture the full holiday fluctuation (avg ~49 units) while smoothing out the extreme peak and valley. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to reflect the current high variance environment. This allows the backend to maintain a safety buffer without overstocking as we exit the holiday season.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 46 (2019/12/23), which is the peak holiday/Christmas week. History shows significant demand volatility during this season: Period 38 (78 units), Period 42 (90 units), and Period 45 (89 units). The drop in Period 43 (19) and Period 44 (26) was likely a short lull before the final holiday surge. Given the current date and the product (superstretch jeggings), we expect high demand for holiday shopping and potential post-holiday sales. Based on the spikes in P42 and P45, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 90 to ensure sufficient stock during this final peak week. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the high variance observed in recent weeks (ranging from 19 to 90). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed with spikes of ~90 units in late Nov (P42) and mid-Dec (P45), interspersed with sharp tactical drops (low as 19).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30, 2019). The holiday demand peak for denim jeggings is historically volatile, with recent spikes around 90 units (P42, P45) followed by moderate demand (72 units in P46). As we transition from the peak holiday season (late December) into January, demand typically stabilizes or begins a slow descent before the spring cycle. However, January demand (from historical samples provided: 57, 73, 88, 73) suggests a mean of approximately 73 units. The current lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the transition from the high-volatility holiday period to the early January baseline, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the holiday fluctuatons and the most recent post-peak data) to smooth the forecast. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=5 to capture the high recent volatility, ensuring we maintain a sufficient service level against the end-of-year variability.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peaked with ~90 units in late Nov/mid-Dec; P46 demand (72) suggests a transition towards January baselines (~73 units).
