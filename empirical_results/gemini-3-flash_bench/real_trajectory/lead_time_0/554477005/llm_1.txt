  "rationale": "Product Description: 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS' is a pair of airy viscose trousers, which are generally lightweight and suitable for late winter/early spring transitions or casual wear. Historical demand (Jan-Early Feb) averaged 22 units per week (min 15, max 27). Period 1 begins on Feb 11, 2019. This is still late winter but approaching the spring retail season. Demand has been relatively stable, though the most recent data point (Feb 4) showed a dip to 15. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now arrives in time for Period 1 sales. However, I must verify actual lead time in subsequent periods. Initial stock is 0. To cover the current period's expected demand (based on the historical average of ~22, conservatively rounding up to account for potential spring interest), I will order 25 units to ensure immediate availability and establish a baseline for actual lead time verification.",

In-transit is 0. I missed sales in P2 (demand was 41, sold only 28) because I didn't anticipate the spike. e) Order Logic: I need to cover Period 3 demand (which occurs after my order) plus provide a buffer for the upward trend.

Current date is May 27 (Memorial Day in the US), traditionally a key retail milestone marking the start of summer and often featuring sales or high demand for seasonal apparel. (b) Demand Analysis: Demand exhibits high volatility. Recent weeks (P12-P15) showed 111, 79, 83, and most recently 122 units. The jump to 122 in P15 coincides with the approach of late May/Memorial Day, suggesting a second, albeit smaller, early-summer peak compared to the late-April surge. (c) Lead Time: Consistently 0 periods. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: 0 on-hand, 0 in-transit. The stockout in P15 (lost demand of at least 37 units) indicates the forecast was too low. (e) Strategy: Anticipating stabilized but elevated early-summer demand, I will order enough to cover the recent uptick (122) plus a safety buffer for potential Memorial Day tail-end demand or sustained early-June interest. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1), the penalty for a stockout is missed profit, while the penalty for overstocking is exactly the same in holding costs; I will target a quantity slightly above the recent high to avoid further stockouts.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is an airy viscose trouser, which is highly seasonal and currently in a deep winter off-season. Analysis of the recent demand (P41-P46) shows extremely low volume: 3, 17, 2, 5, 6, 6 (average ~6.5 units/week). The date is December 30, right at the end of the year. There is no evidence of a mid-winter surge. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 4 units. Given the low-demand regime and the holding cost equal to profit ($1.00), minimizing inventory is crucial to avoid eroding the small margins. I will order 6 units to cover potential demand for the coming period while keeping ending inventory low, targeting a total availability of 10 units.",
