Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 685814003 (Men's Hoodie). Historically, demand for the last 5 weeks has been [75, 51, 57, 123, 84], showing significant volatility but no clear seasonal trend for early February. The average demand is 78 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 29. The promised lead time is 0. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. For the first period, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (all available history) to capture the current mean and variance. This ensures that the OR backend sets a base stock level that covers the immediate demand for the current period, balancing the service level (given the $4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost) against potential stockouts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a basic jersey hoodie. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a mean of 78 units, though it peaked at 123 in late January. Demand in Period 1 was 49, which is lower than the recent average but within expected variance for post-peak winter basics. The actual lead time for Period 1 was 0, matching the promised lead time. Since on-hand inventory is 53 and promised lead time is 0, we need to ensure local availability for the current period's demand (which occurs after the decision). I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand mean to capture the recent trend including the higher January volumes, and a recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect current volatility. L will remain at default (0).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Reviewing the history: Period 1 had a demand of 49, and Period 2 had a demand of 123. The historical samples (Jan 7 - Feb 4) were 75, 51, 57, 123, 84 (Mean: 78). The actual lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods for both completed orders. We are currently out of stock (ending on-hand 0 in P2) because demand (123) exceeded available inventory (100). The current date is late February; there's no immediate major retail holiday, but the high demand in Period 2 suggests volatility or a potential upward shift. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the recent higher demand (including the P2 123 and historical samples) while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat will use all samples (default) to account for the high variance observed (ranging from 49 to 123).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of March 4th, 2019, the demand for the Richie Hood (SKU 685814003) has shown significant volatility. The historical demand samples (75, 51, 57, 123, 84) and the recorded game history demand (Period 1: 49, Period 2: 123, Period 3: 48) suggest a highly variable demand pattern without a clear seasonal takeoff yet, despite being a sweatshirt product. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (P1, P2, and P3 orders all arrived in the same period). In Period 2, we experienced a stockout (sold 100 on demand of 123) because the starting inventory plus the same-period arrival was insufficient. Currently, on-hand inventory is 74. Given the high variance (ranging from ~50 to ~120), I will use the recent_N method for both mean and sigma calculation to capture the recent volatility. I will use N=8 (combining the 5 historical samples and 3 game history samples) to provide a more robust estimate of the mean and standard deviation, ensuring our base stock level can handle the spikes seen in Period 2 and Historical Sample 4.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a Richie Hood (Men's Hoodie), which is a staple item. Observed demand for the last five weeks (including pre-game samples) is 75, 51, 57, 123, 84, 49, 123, 48, 59. The mean demand is approximately 74 units per period with a standard deviation of 29. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival) across all four game periods. Period 2 saw a stockout due to a high demand realization of 123 (tied with the 2019-01-28 peak), suggesting we need to maintain a buffer to capture these peaks. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time since the promised 0 corresponds perfectly with historical behavior. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use the 'default' method (incorporating all historical samples) to ensure the baseline reflects the hoodie's typical demand variability, including those periodic spikes above 100 units.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a Men's Hoodie. Looking at the demand history (including provided historical samples), we see values of 75, 51, 57, 123, 84 (pre-game) and 49, 123, 48, 59, 70 (Periods 1-5). The mean demand across these 10 samples is roughly 73.9. There is no clear seasonal trend yet for mid-March for this basics item, but demand is somewhat volatile (range 48-123). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 5 game periods, matching the promised lead time of 0. Inventory management needs to account for the fact that demand occurs after the order arrives and is resolved in the same period (L=0). On-hand is currently 30. Using all 10 historical samples (5 pre-game + 5 game) provides a stable estimate for mean and variance. N=10 is selected to capture the full recent history. The profit margin is $4/unit and holding cost is $1/unit, leading to a critical ratio of 0.8, which the OR backend will use with our provided mu and sigma.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product is a basic men's hoodie. Historical demand shows significant volatility (ranging from 27 to 123) without a clear seasonal trend in this early spring period. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 2, we experienced a stockout because demand (123) exceeded our starting inventory (100). The current on-hand inventory is 71 units with 0 in-transit. Given the high demand variance (std dev ~38), I will base my demand forecast on the recent 5 samples (P2-P6 mean = 65.4) to capture the current regime while allowing for volatility. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 will help the OR backend maintain a sufficient buffer (about 1.25 standard deviations for the calculated 0.8 critical ratio) to avoid the stockout seen in Period 2.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 is a 'Jersey Basic Hoodie'. We are currently entering Period 8 (April 1, 2019). Historically, demand for this item has been volatile, with a significant spike in Period 2 (123 units) and a recent decline in Periods 6 and 7 (27 and 18 units respectively). The recent low demand likely reflects the transition out of the peak early spring season for sweatshirts. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 78 units on hand and 0 in transit. To set the OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time (0) matches the observed lead time. 2) For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering periods 3 through 7) to capture the cooling demand trend while still accounting for the average (approx. 44 units/period), as the very low demand in the last two weeks might be an outlier or a sharp seasonal drop. 3) For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility, which is lower than the early period spikes. This configuration balances the risk of overstocking during a clear downward trend with the need to maintain a service level for a basic hoodie.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a Richie Hood (sweatshirt), which typically sees a demand drop as spring progresses. Indeed, demand has significantly slowed from an average of ~71 in the first 5 weeks to 23.3 in the last 3 weeks (Periods 6-8). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is 0. With 53 units on hand and a current demand trend of ~23 units/week, I have sufficient stock for approximately 2 weeks. Since lead time is 0, I can afford to use the recent_N method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this downward trend and avoid overstocking. For sigma_hat, I will use N=8 (the full observed history length) to ensure the system accounts for previous volatility (which was higher early on), protecting against potential demand spikes while the lower mu_hat keeps the ordering ceiling lean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg decreased from ~71 to ~23 units/per (-67%) likely due to seasonal transition to spring.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a 'Richie Hood' sweatshirt/hoodie, which is a seasonal item typically seeing higher demand in winter and a decrease in spring. History confirms this: demand averaged ~71 units in periods 1-5 (Feb to early March) and dropped to ~21 units in periods 6-9 (mid-March to mid-April). On-hand inventory is 38, which covers nearly two weeks of current demand levels. Promised lead time is 0 and historical arrivals confirm actual lead time remains 0. I will use the recent demand regime (last 4 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the earlier high-demand data is no longer representative of the spring season. This will prevent overstocking of a seasonal item while utilizing the OR engine's service level logic with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/04/22). The product is a hoodie, and demand has significantly decreased since mid-March (Period 6), likely due to the seasonal transition from winter to spring. From Period 6 onwards, weekly demand samples are [27, 18, 25, 15, 19], yielding a mean of 20.8 and a standard deviation of 4.8. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0. Since the current on-hand inventory is 19 and the estimated weekly demand is ~21, we are at risk of stockout in the upcoming period. I will use the 'recent_N' method for all parameters with N=5 (capturing the spring regime from Period 6 to 10) to allow the OR engine to calculate the base stock and order enough to cover this low-demand state while maintaining a safety buffer.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a 'Richie Hood' (Hoodie), which is seeing a seasonal decline as we move further into spring. Historical demand since Period 6 has stabilized into a lower regime, with an average of approximately 21 units per period (27, 18, 25, 15, 19, 22). The previous carry-over insight correctly identified this shift. On-hand inventory is very low (4 units) and there is nothing in transit. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed), I will maintain L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this lower spring demand regime while ignoring the higher winter demand from Periods 1-5. This will ensure we order enough to meet this lower but consistent demand without overstocking during the seasonal downturn.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and the product (a cotton-blend hoodie with soft brushed inside) is experiencing a seasonal decline as we move into late spring/early summer. Demand from Period 6 onwards (ending April 29th) has averaged 23.8 units per period, a significant drop from the earlier average of ~71 units. Period 12 saw a slight uptick to 38 units of demand, but we ran out of stock (sold 25, demand was 38), resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 0. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking a seasonal item while still meeting this lower demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat focusing on the last 7 periods (the 'low' regime starting at P6). This will set parameters based on the current run rate (avg ~24) rather than the heavy winter demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in the 'low' regime (avg ~24) despite a minor spike in P12; inventory management should prioritize low holding costs for this seasonal hoodie as summer approaches.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. This product is a 'Jersey Basic' hoodie, which is highly seasonal. As seen in the carry-over insights and historical data, demand dropped significantly starting in mid-March (Period 6) as the season transitioned from winter to spring/summer. The 'low' regime has been sustained for 8 periods (P6-P13), with demand averaging approximately 23.0 units per period (excluding the stock-out period P12 where demand was 38 but sales were limited to 25). The current on-hand inventory is 10 units. Given the seasonality and the high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4), maintaining lean inventory is crucial to avoid losses as we approach summer. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture this low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time (0).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a RICHIE HOOD (hoodie), which is seeing seasonally low demand as summer approaches. The demand regime shift identified in Period 9 remains consistent; since Period 6, demand has averaged approx 23.3 units/period (P6-P14: 27, 18, 25, 15, 19, 22, 38, 20, 22). The spike in P12 (38) appears to be an outlier. Historically, the lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (8 units on-hand), and since the lead time is 0, the backend will target a base stock level to satisfy both the upcoming period's demand and safety stock using the recent stable regime. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture only the post-shift demand data (P6 to P14), ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on high February/early March demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a hoodie, which is in a low-demand seasonal trough as summer approaches. Since Period 6, demand has stabilized into a lower regime (averaging 21.8 units over the last 10 periods). Most recently (P13-P15), demand has been 20, 22, and 12 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. With on-hand inventory at 17 units and low demand expectations, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture this stable 'low' regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This protects against overstocking a seasonal item while maintaining sufficient stock for the current steady but low demand. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1) suggests a target service level of 80%, which the OR backend will handle using these parameters.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a hoodie, which is currently in a low-demand summer season. The demand regime shift noted at Period 6 (reduction of ~67% in demand) has remained consistent through Period 16. Analyzing demand from P6 to P16, the mean is approximately 21.4 units/period. The most recent 5 periods (P12-P16) show a similar mean of 22.8 units/period. Therefore, I will use recent_N (N=11, covering the period since the regime shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they were placed, so the default lead time (0) is maintained. With high holding costs ($1) relative to profit ($4), the backend's base-stock logic will naturally maintain a lean inventory to avoid carrying stock into the summer.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a hoodie (RICHIE HOOD), which is experiencing its seasonal low during the transition from spring to summer. Demand history confirms a regime shift around Period 6 (mid-March), where demand dropped from an average of ~71 to approximately 21.3 units per period (average of Periods 6-17). Recent demand from Period 13-17 has been stable, averaging 18 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 14 units with no in-transit units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (as confirmed by the history of Period 1 through 17), I will continue to use the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will focus on the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the current 'low' seasonal regime accurately while maintaining a buffer for the minor fluctuations observed (e.g., P12, P16). This conservative approach helps avoid overstocking a winter item in summer while maintaining a reasonable service level.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The SKU is a 'RICHIE HOOD' (hoodie), which is experiencing low off-season demand as summer begins. Since Period 6 (March 18), the average demand has stabilized at approximately 21.6 units per period (sample range: 8-38). The most recent demand samples (Periods 15-18: 12, 22, 14, 8) even suggest a further tapering as temperatures rise. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. With 19 units on hand and 0 in transit, existing stock nearly covers the current low-demand average. I will use a recent window (N=13, covering the low-demand regime since Period 6) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets the 80% service level appropriate for the current $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, while avoiding overstocking on a seasonal item entering its trough.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for the 'RICHIE HOOD' (a sweatshirt/hoodie) continues to decline as the region moves deeper into summer. In the last three periods (P17-P19), demand has fallen from 14 to 8 to 5 units, with an average of 9 units per period. The broader 'low' regime identified in Period 6 (average ~23) is now shifting even lower due to the peak of summer. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With 22 units on-hand, we have enough stock to cover roughly 2-4 weeks of current demand without ordering, which is desirable given the $1/unit holding cost versus the $4 profit. I will set L to 'calculate' (0) and use 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering the entire low-demand regime since mid-March) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine recognizes the significantly lower volume compared to the initial high-demand period in February.

Carry-over insight: Demand has entered an even lower summer trough starting Period 17: avg decreased from ~23 to ~9 units/period (-60%) as summer temperatures peak.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. We are dealing with a hoodie (seasonal winter/spring item) in the middle of summer. Demand history shows three distinct regimes: Period 1-5 (avg ~70), Period 6-16 (avg ~23), and Period 17-20 (avg ~9, excluding the P20 outlier). In Period 20, there was a sudden spike of 59 units against an average of ~9, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Given the product type (hoodie) and the date (July), this spike is likely an anomaly or a clearance-driven event rather than a sustained trend shift back to high demand. However, because on-hand inventory is currently 0, I must restock. I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=4) to cover Periods 17-20. This averages the summer trough (5, 8, 14) with the recent spike (59), providing a buffer against further volatility while acknowledging the low seasonal baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8th, 2019. We are seeing a significant demand spike (P20: 59, P21: 98), which contradicts the previous 'summer trough' expectation. This likely indicates a mid-summer clearance sale or a 'back-to-school' early push for hoodies, despite the warm weather. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit, and we have stocked out for two consecutive periods, losing significant potential profit. The lead time appears stable at 0 periods. To capture this new high-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly from the low-demand summer forecast back to a high-volume footing, while keeping L at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Previous summer trough reversed into a sharp spike (avg ~78 over last 2 weeks), potentially due to sales events or early seasonal restocking demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '685814003' (Richie Hood) has experienced a significant demand spike starting in Period 20 (July). Recent demand figures are 59, 98, and 87 (Avg: 81.33). This contradicts the earlier seasonal expectation of a summer trough for hoodies, suggesting either a major sales event or early back-to-school/pre-autumn shopping. With on-hand inventory nearly depleted (7 units) and lead time consistently at 0 periods, I must aggressively stock to meet this new high-demand regime. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this spike without being skewed by the very low June figures or the high early-year samples. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand spike confirmed from P20 to P22: avg ~81 units/period vs previous summer trough of ~9 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Richie Hood) has entered a high-demand regime since Period 20. Demand over the last four periods (P20-P23) has been 59, 98, 87, and 65, averaging approximately 77 units per period. This contrasts sharply with the previous summer trough of ~9 units. Despite being a hoodie, this late July spike is sustained and likely represents a pre-fall shopping surge or a significant promotional event. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To adequately capture this new regime while balancing the risk of a sudden drop, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to align the base stock with the current ~77 units/period average. Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures the increased volatility from this shift is factored into the safety stock calculation.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the hoodie (SKU 685814003) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 20, peaking at an average of ~81 units for several weeks, but has shown an abrupt drop to 30 units in Period 24. While the previously documented 'spike' was sustained for 4 periods, Period 24 indicates a possible cooling off as we exit the peak of July sales events. Currently, on-hand inventory is 63 units with no in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mean demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent volatile period (averaging ~68 units over the last 5 periods) while allowing the OR backend to adjust for the lower P24 observation. Lead time remains 'default' (0), and sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to account for the high variance during this transition period from high-spike back towards a lower baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high following the P20-P23 spike; Period 24 showed a 50% decrease from the spike average (30 vs 81), suggesting the peak may have passed.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '685814003' (Richie Hood) is experiencing high demand volatility as it transitions out of the summer trough. We saw a massive spike from P20-P23 (avg ~78), followed by a dip in P24 (30), and now a significant rebound in P25 (58). Given the current date is August 5th, this likely represents early 'Back-to-School' shopping or fall pre-season demand for hoodies. The Carry-Over insights confirm a regime shift at P20. However, the last two periods (P24-P25) have averaged 44 units, significantly lower than the P20-P23 peak but much higher than the summer baseline (~9). I will use recent_N=6 to capture the entire 'new regime' period (P20-P25), which averages ~66 units/period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The OR backend needs to maintain a safety stock to handle the high variance (std dev is high due to the recent spike), so using recent_N for both mu and sigma will allow it to respond to the elevated fall demand level while acknowledging the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Fall demand pulse confirmed: Demand since P20 remains highly volatile but significantly elevated (avg ~66) compared to summer baseline, indicating a seasonal shift towards fall apparel.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a sweatshirt hoodie, which is entering a peak seasonal demand period (Back-to-School/Fall). Period 26 demand (117) confirms a significant upward trend compared to the recent average. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). Lead time is consistently 0. Since Period 20, the demand has been highly volatile but elevated, averaging approximately 74 units per period (59, 98, 87, 65, 30, 58, 117). Using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat will capture this elevated seasonal regime (approx. 74 units) and provide a higher stock target to prevent further stockouts during this surge. sigma_hat will also use N=7 to account for the high volatility observed in this period (std dev approx 28), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Fall demand surge confirmed; demand in P26 (117) reached its highest level since P2, marking a definitive shift into the peak season for hoodies.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (hoodie) is experiencing a severe peak season surge as we move into late August (Back-to-School/Fall transition). Demand in Period 27 hit 154 units, following 117 in Period 26, both resulting in stockouts despite aggressive ordering. The current actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods based on consistent history (ordered and arrived in the same period). Given the rapid acceleration in demand (from ~60-80 units in July to >150 in mid-August), a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 is used to capture the peak shift (P24-P27: 30, 58, 117, 154; mean=89.75, std=54.4). To prevent further lost sales during this critical growth phase, mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using this recent peak window. On-hand is currently 0, so the backend OR logic will place an order to reach the calculated base stock immediately.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Peak Fall demand surge confirmed; demand has accelerated from ~60 to >150 units/period over the last 3 weeks (P25-P27), significantly exceeding early summer expectations.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Richie Hood) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime driven by the transition into the Fall peak season (Back-to-School/Autumn). Demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) was 117, 154, and 102, with an average of 124.3 units. This is a significant increase from the early summer average (~66) and the mid-summer trough (~9). The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm that actual lead time consistently matches this (arrivals occur in the same period as ordering). I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this most recent peak demand level (avg ~124, which results in a base stock targeted at ~248 for the review + lead time period). Sigma_hat is also set using N=3 to reflect the current high volatility (std dev ~26). With current on-hand inventory at 35 units and 0 in-transit, this will trigger an order to refill to the safe Fall inventory level, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak demand regime confirmed: Avg demand for P26-P28 is 124 units/period, compared to the previous Fall pulse (avg 66) and summer trough (avg 9). High volatility maintained.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. We are in the 'Fall peak demand' regime for this hoodie. While demand in Period 29 (67) dropped compared to the previous three-week peak (avg 124), this is likely high-frequency volatility within a sustained high-demand season rather than a regime collapse. History shows significant spikes in late August/early September consistent with back-to-school and fall transitions. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts during this high-demand season against holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using N=4 (Periods 26-29) to capture the recent Fall elevation (avg ~110) while moderating for the lower P29 observation. Sigma_hat is set to 20 to reflect the high volatility observed in this regime (range 67-154).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Richie Hood) is in its peak Fall seasonal regime. The current date is 2019/09/09, which aligns with cooler temperatures and high sweatshirt demand. Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 26, we have seen a significant increase in demand compared to the summer trough, with a moving average of approximately 110 units per period (P26: 117, P27: 154, P28: 102, P29: 67, P30: 108). Period 29 showed a dip to 67 units, but Period 30 rebounded to 108, confirming that the peak regime is still active. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this elevated 'Fall Peak' regime (avg ~110, std ~32). This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that satisfies high demand while being responsive to the recent volatility seen in early September.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak demand regime for hoodies sustained through early September (P26-P30): avg demand remains elevated at ~110 units/period with high week-to-week volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019, which is squarely in the peak fall season for hoodies. Historical demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) has averaged approximately 111.5 units per period (117, 154, 102, 67, 108, 121), confirming the 'Fall peak demand regime' identified in previous carry-over insights. While there is significant week-to-week volatility, the trend remains strong as we move deeper into autumn. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 15), and the lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level during this peak season and avoid the stockouts seen in P26 and P27, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current regime's high mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the anticipated 110+ unit demand for the upcoming period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'RICHIE HOOD' remains in a stable but volatile Fall peak regime. Over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), the average demand has been approximately 112 units per period (117, 154, 102, 67, 108, 121, 115). This aligns with the seasonal expectation for jersey hoodies as temperatures cool in September. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage this peak while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation of ~27 during this period), I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the current high-demand baseline. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to reflect the specific volatility observed in this peak regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to maintain high service levels during the seasonal surge without excessive overstocking as we move further into the season.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak demand regime (P26-P32) has stabilized at an average of ~112 units/period, showing sustained high demand for hoodies into late September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. We are in the peak Fall demand regime for hoodies. Since Period 26 (August 5), demand has stabilized at a high level. Analyzing the last 8 periods (P26-P33), the mean demand is approximately 111 units per period (117, 154, 102, 67, 108, 121, 115, 105). While there is some volatility (standard deviation around 25), the demand is consistently high as we move into October. Promised lead time is 0 and historical data confirms actual lead time consistently matches this. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this specific Fall peak regime while filtering out the low summer demand data. This ensures the base stock reflects the current high-demand environment to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Richie Hoodie) is currently in its peak fall season. In Period 34 (late September), demand spiked significantly to 210 units, far exceeding the recent stabilized average of ~112 units. This surge resulted in a stockout (sold 132, ending inventory 0). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and prepare for potentially sustained high demand in October, I am increasing the demand forecast. Since the Period 34 value (210) is a significant outlier compared to the previous 8 weeks (P26-P33 avg ~112), I will use an explicit forecast that captures this upward trend while maintaining high volatility (sigma) to account for recent spikes. I'll set mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~160 (splitting the difference between the prior regime and the new spike) and a high explicit sigma to ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient order to replenish on-hand inventory to meet peak potential demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand hit a season-high peak of 210 units in P34, indicating an acceleration of fall demand beyond the previous stable avg of 112.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. We are in the peak Fall/Winter season for hoodies. Demand has been highly volatile: P34 saw a season-high spike of 210 units, followed by a sharp drop to 67 units in P35. This level of volatility is typical for seasonal apparel during transition months. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high stockout risk (demonstrated in P34 where 78 units of demand were lost) and the current on-hand inventory of 131, I need to ensure the base stock level (mu_hat) accounts for the potential return of high-volume demand weeks. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the Fall regime (P26-P35), where the average demand is approximately 117 units. This provides a balance between the extreme peak of 210 and the lower dips, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers these fluctuations without excessive overstocking, as holding costs are substantial ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit).

Carry-over insight: Fall high-volatility regime confirmed (P26-P35): Avg demand is ~117 units/period with peaks up to 210 and troughs near 67. Demand patterns are inconsistent week-to-week, requiring higher safety stock for the peak season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019, which is deep into the peak fall/winter season for hoodies. Since Period 26 (August), we have seen a sustained high-demand regime with an average of approximately 110-120 units per period. However, volatility remains extreme, with demand swinging between 60 and 210 units (P34 peak was 210, followed by P35/P36 dropping to 67 and 60). Despite the recent lower demand in P35 and P36, the overall seasonal trend for hoodies in late October suggests demand will remain high or potentially increase further as winter approaches. Setting mu_hat using the last 11 samples (P26-P36) captures this entire high-demand Fall regime (average ~112). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to balance the high peak requirements with the recent moderate weeks, providing enough safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P26, P27, and P34 while respecting the high holding cost ($1.00 relative to $4.00 profit). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Fall/Winter high-volatility regime sustained (P26-P36). Peak season average remains stable at ~112 units/period, but extreme weekly variance (60 to 210 units) requires significant safety stock buffers as winter approaches.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 28, 2019. We are in the heart of the Fall/Winter peak season for hoodies. Since the regime shift in Period 26, demand has been highly volatile but consistently elevated. The most recent demand (P34-P37) shows a sequence of 210, 67, 60, and 74 units. While the massive 210-unit spike in P34 appears to have subsided, leading to a recent 4-period average of 102.75, the overall volatility remains high (CV > 0.5). We are maintaining a lead time value of 0, as all orders have arrived in the same period they were placed. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 12 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P26 onwards) to capture the current seasonal average of approximately 114 units, which provides a safer base stock than a shorter window that might over-react to the recent dip. For sigma_hat, I am using the same N=12 window to ensure the OR engine accounts for the extreme spikes (up to 210) observed during this peak season, maintaining high service levels as the cost of a stockout ($4) significantly outweighs the holding cost ($1).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Richie Hood) is in its peak fall/winter season (November). While recent demand in P38 (30 units) was lower than the peak average, history shows extreme volatility in this regime (P26-P38 avg: ~104, with peaks up to 210). The current on-hand inventory is 114 units. Given the product is a hoodie and we are entering November, demand is expected to remain high with significant variance. I will use a recent_N of 13 (covering the start of the Fall peak in P26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime while ensuring the safety stock is sufficient to handle potential weekly surges back toward the 150-200 unit range. Lead time L=0 is confirmed by history.

Carry-over insight: P39: Demand regime P26-P38 confirmed as Fall/Winter high-volatility peak (avg ~104, std dev ~46). Demand remains unpredictable with frequent swings between 30 and 210 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, which is deep into the fall/winter peak season for hoodies. In Period 39 (last week), we saw a significant demand spike to 159 units, which caused a stockout (on-hand is now 0). This confirms the high-volatility regime identified since Period 26: demand oscillates between ~30 and 210 units with high variance. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent stockout and the high demand in P39, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the regime since roughly P26) to ensure the OR backend captures the higher average (approx. 104) and the substantial volatility (std dev approx. 46) necessary to mitigate stockout risks during this peak period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is just before the peak holiday/Black Friday season. Demand for hoodies has surged significantly over the last two periods (P39: 159, P40: 190), resulting in stockouts. This indicates a move from the Fall average of ~104 toward a late-Fall/early-Winter peak. Historically, Lead Time remains 0 periods. To recover from stockouts and prepare for Black Friday demand, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the accelerating trend of the last few weeks (P36-P40: 60, 74, 30, 159, 190; mean=102.6). While the 5-week mean is 102.6, the most recent values (159, 190) suggest the actual requirement is even higher. By using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will reflect this increased volatility and volume. The 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio justifies keeping a safety buffer to avoid further lost sales during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: P41: Late Fall/Pre-Holiday demand surge confirmed (P39-P40); demand accelerated from historical Fall avg of ~104 to ~175 units/period (+68%), resulting in consecutive stockouts.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Men's Hoodie) is in a definitive peak season (Late Fall/Pre-Holiday), with Period 42 falling on 2019/11/25 (Black Week/Cyber Monday timeframe). Demand has surged significantly over the last three periods: P39 (159), P40 (190), and P41 (205), leading to three consecutive stockouts. The current average demand for this surge regime (P39-P41) is ~185 units/period, which is substantially higher than the previous Fall average of ~112. With the holiday shopping peak imminent, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 215 to account for the clear upward trend and provide buffer against continued stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to 45 (approximate standard deviation of the last 5 periods) to handle the high volatility seen in this peak stage. Lead time (L) remains 0 as confirmed by the consistent same-period arrivals in the history.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Late Fall/Holiday surge confirmed (P39-P41). Demand has escalated from ~104 to ~185 units/period (+78%) as of late November, resulting in repeated stockouts. Retail peak (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) is now active.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Richie Hood) is currently in its absolute peak seasonal demand phase, driven by late Fall and the Black Friday/Cyber Monday (Period 42) retail events. We observed a massive demand spike in P42 (404 units), which far exceeded the previous surge average of ~185. This caused a complete stockout despite a significantly increased order. Given the critical date (12/2), we are now in the heart of the December holiday shopping season. I am projecting a high sustained demand regime. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it at 360 units (a weight between the recent surge average and the massive P42 spike) to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture remaining holiday demand while accounting for potential post-Cyber Monday cooling. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the extreme volatility of the last month (~P39-P42). Lead time remains 'default' (0) as evidenced by the consistent immediate arrival of orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme Holiday peak confirmed. Demand reached a season-high of 404 units in P42 (Black Friday week), resulting in a stockout. Projected demand regime for early December shifted to ~350+ units/period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 44 (2019/12/09), following the extreme Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak observed in P42 (404 units). In P43, demand dropped sharply to 73 units. This 'post-peak' crash is typical after major retail events as consumers have finished their primary shopping. However, we are still within the December holiday shopping window. Historical data from P1 (Jan/Feb) and the recent spike suggest demand will not go to zero but will likely settle into a pre-Christmas 'last-minute' or 'gift-giving' regime, though lower than the Black Friday extreme. The current on-hand inventory is 381 units. Given the drastic drop from 404 to 73, and the risk of high holding costs ($1/unit) versus profit ($4/unit), I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (which covers the lead-up, the peak, and the crash) to smooth the estimate, resulting in an expected demand around 209 units. Since on-hand (381) already exceeds this forecast significantly, the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering to avoid excessive holding costs while the surplus is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday peak demand collapse: Demand dropped from 404 (P42) to 73 (P43), a decrease of ~82% following the Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment has entered the post-holiday period (mid-December). Period 42 marked the extreme peak (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) with 404 units, followed by a sharp normalization in Period 43 (73 units) and Period 44 (129 units). The current on-hand inventory is 252 units, which is quite high relative to the post-peak demand. Historical demand for January (the very beginning of the samples) showed a range of 51 to 123 units. We are likely entering a standard winter demand regime which is lower than the holiday peak but higher than the summer trough. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture the immediate post-peak average of ~101 units, combined with a manual sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed throughout the Fall/Winter season. Lead time remains stable at 0. With 252 units on hand, the OR engine likely won't place an order this period unless the base stock calculation exceeds the current stock levels, which is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs as we exit the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization confirmed: demand dropped from the 404 peak to an average of ~101 units over P43-P44.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019 (Period 46). We have moved past the extreme Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak (P42 demand: 404). Post-peak demand has normalized over the last three weeks (P43-P45) with values of 73, 129, and 137, averaging approximately 113 units per period. This indicates demand has returned to the Fall/Winter baseline (previously identified at ~117 units/period) rather than collapsing entirely, likely due to pre-Christmas shopping and colder weather for hoodies. On-hand inventory is 115. With a lead time of 0 (consistently observed), we need to cover the current period's demand. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-holiday normalization (P43-P45) while discarding the massive P42 outlier, setting the forecast to approximately 113 units per period. This ensures we maintain availability for any late December surge without overstocking as we head into the traditionally slower January period.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization confirmed (P43-P45): Demand has returned to a baseline of ~113 units/period after the Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak of 404 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are in the post-holiday normalization phase for the 'RICHIE HOOD' SKU. Following the extreme peak of 404 units in Period 42 (Black Friday week), demand has stabilized significantly. For the last four periods (P43-P46), demand has been 73, 129, 137, and 111 units respectively, averaging approximately 112.5 units/period. This aligns with the 'Fall peak' baseline observed prior to the mid-November surge. As we move into January, demand for hoodies typically remains steady but avoids the retail peak volatility. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new stable post-holiday average (~113 per period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the reduced but persistent variation in the post-peak period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.
