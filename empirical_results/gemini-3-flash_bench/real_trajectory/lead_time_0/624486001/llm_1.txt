  "rationale": "Product 'Brit Baby Tee' is a basic jersey T-shirt, which typically has consistent baseline demand but can see early spring spikes as weather warms. Historical data shows a clear upward trend: 55 -> 60 -> 66 -> 88 -> 108 units over the last 5 weeks. This suggests a seasonal ramp-up or a successful product launch phase. The last recorded demand was 108. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive in the current period's arrival resolution phase and be available to meet Period 1 demand. To avoid stockouts considering the strong upward trend, I will forecast Period 1 demand at approximately 120-130 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I must order enough to cover this period's demand plus a small safety buffer for continued growth.",
