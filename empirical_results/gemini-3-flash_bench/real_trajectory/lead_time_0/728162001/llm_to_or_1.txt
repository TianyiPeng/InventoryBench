Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is a Women's V-neck T-shirt, a staple garment. Historically, demand over the last 5 weeks has been [51, 30, 35, 39, 25], showing a slight downward trend but generally averaging 36 units/week. Since the promised lead time (L) is 0, we start with the 'default' lead time method. For demand (mu_hat), the recent data indicates a slight cooling from the initial 51, so I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full historical context provided without being overly sensitive to the single low value of 25. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover Period 1 demand, which occurs after the decision.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a Women's Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt, a staple item. Period 1 concluded with a demand of 53, which matches the highest historical sample (51 on 2019-01-07). All 53 units ordered in Period 1 arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods works in practice. Current on-hand is 0, and there is no inventory in transit. Historical demand samples (51, 30, 35, 39, 25) plus Period 1 (53) show a mean of ~39 and a standard deviation of ~11. Since we are in mid-February, we are moving away from the post-holiday slump towards spring, so I will prioritize recent demand. I'll use recent_N (N=6, including P1 demand) to capture the recent uptick while maintaining the lead time at 0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, and demand has surged significantly from an average of ~36 units in January to 93 units in Period 2 (Feb 18). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt, which likely sees increasing demand as Spring approaches. Last period, we stocked 58 units based on recent averages but faced a stockout with demand reaching 93. I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use the last 3 samples (including the spike) to better capture this upward trend. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period reaction. I'll use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent high demand and increased volatility more heavily, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent demand jump.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting mid-February: Demand increased from ~36 (Jan) to 93 (Feb 18), coinciding with early Spring seasonality for basic jersey tops.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1546.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 4 (2019-03-04), we are in a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey top category. Demand shifted significantly in mid-February, moving from an average of ~36 in January to an average of 88 over the past two periods (93 in P2, 83 in P3). This aligns with the start of the spring retail season. Lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 all arrived within the same period). Current on-hand inventory is 31. To ensure we meet the new demand level (avg ~88) for the upcoming period, the base stock needs to reflect this higher regime. I will use recent_N (N=2) for both demand and volatility to capture the current high-demand spring regime without the downward bias of the January data. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (95%), so capturing the recent variance is critical to avoiding stockouts like those seen in P1 and P2.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-03-11. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt', which is seeing a clear spring seasonal upturn. Historical demand (Jan) was ~36 units/week. Since Feb 18 (Period 2), demand has increased significantly: 93, 83, 121. The mean of these last three periods is 99 units. In Period 4, we stocked out (demand 121, sold 100), suggesting true demand might be even higher. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this new demand regime and avoid stockouts during this spring ramp-up, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-Feb 18 behavior (mean ~99, std ~20). I will keep L at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Demand for jersey basics increased from ~36 to avg 99 (+175%) starting mid-February (P2-P4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162001 (Women's Jersey Basic V-neck) is experiencing a massive demand surge. In Period 5 (March 11), demand spiked to 270 units, far exceeding previous estimates. Historical demand patterns (Jan-Feb) were ~36 units, rising to ~100 in early March, and now accelerating as we move further into Spring. The product currently has 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid significant stockouts during this high-growth phase, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime. Given the extreme jump from 121 to 270, using the last 3 periods (N=3: 83, 121, 270) provides a mean of 158, which is still conservative but more responsive than long-term averages. I'll use recent_N for both mu and sigma to capture this increased scale and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated Period 5: Demand spiked to 270 (+170% vs previous 3-period avg), likely due to peak Spring seasonality for jersey basics.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck jersey T-shirt. Current date is March 25th, which aligns with peak early-spring demand for essentials. Historical data shows a clear regime shift: Jan (avg ~36) \u2192 Feb (avg ~88) \u2192 March (avg ~268). Periods 5 and 6 demand were 270 and 266 respectively, suggesting demand has stabilized at this high level for the peak season. Since lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed reliability. For demand (mu_hat), the last two weeks (N=2) represent the new plateau (avg ~268). Using recent_N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this high-volume/high-volatility regime to ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts seen in Periods 2, 4, and 5.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at peak Spring levels: Period 5 and 6 demand averaged 268 units, a +640% increase from January baseline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt', which is currently in its peak Spring seasonal demand phase. Historical demand for the last three periods (P5-P7) has been 270, 266, and 233, averaging 256.3 units. This is a significant sustained increase from the January (~36) and February (~88) levels. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1 through 7. To capture this high-demand regime, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to prioritize the most recent Spring peak data. Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to account for the recent volatility in this higher-volume regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that minimizes stockouts during this critical seasonal window while balancing the holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Spring peak: Last 3 periods (P5-P7) average 256 units, reflecting a sustained ~610% increase from the January baseline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162001 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck jersey T-shirt. We are currently in early April (2019/4/8). Historical data showed a significant seasonal surge starting in mid-February, peaking in March (Periods 5-6) with demand around 266-270 units. However, Period 8 (April 1st) showed a significant drop in demand to 136 units, down from the previous 4-period average of ~222. This likely indicates the passing of the initial Spring peak. Current on-hand inventory is 154 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while demand softens, I will adjust mu_hat using a recent_N window that captures this shift (N=3: Periods 6, 7, 8), which averages 211 units\u2014higher than the last data point but lower than the March peak\u2014to hedge against both further drops and potential volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: April 1st (Period 8) demand dropped to 136 units (-40% vs March avg of ~225), suggesting the peak Spring surge is subsiding.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15th. Demand for this jersey basic v-neck t-shirt peaked in March (Periods 5-7, avg ~256) and has since cooled off. Period 8 and 9 demand (136 and 167 respectively) average 151.5 units, which is a -40% decrease from the March peak. This suggests we are settling into a 'post-peak' Spring regime. On-hand inventory is currently 156 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for the stabilized demand, I am using a recent_N method (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent shifting demand trend (the cooling from the peak) while still providing enough weight to handle the current ~150-170 unit demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Spring peak: Demand in April (P8-P9) has averaged 151.5 units, down from the March peak of 256 (-40%).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand history shows a clear seasonal cycle: a low January baseline (~36), a sharp Spring peak in March (averaging ~256), and a post-peak stabilization in April. Specifically, demand in April (P8-P10) has been 136, 167, and 195. While the most recent period (P10) showed a slight uptick to 195, the average for the April regime (N=3) is 166 units. Given the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck jersey t-shirt, it is likely to maintain this steady level after the initial spring surge. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. I will set L to 'default' (0) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this stabilized April regime (avg 166), which ensures the OR backend targets enough stock for the current demand level without over-ordering based on the high March peaks. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the current April volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in April: post-Spring peak demand (P8-P10) averages 166 units, significantly lower than the March peak of 256.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29th, 2019. This SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck) experienced a significant Spring demand peak in March (averaging ~256 units), which has since stabilized into a lower April plateau. Demand over the last four periods (P8-P11) has been 136, 167, 195, and 147, resulting in a mean of 161.25 units. This indicates the high volatility of the Spring surge has subsided. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. I will use the recent_N method with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-peak demand regime while still accounting for the recent variability. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as history consistently confirms the promised 0-period lead time is being met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Spring peak (April): Avg demand for P8-P11 is 161 units, down from the March peak of 256 units (-37%).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/06. Historically, demand for this item (Womens Everyday Jersey Basic T-shirt) followed a strong seasonal ramp-up in March (peaking at ~260) and then stabilized/softened through April. In Period 12 (April 29), demand dropped significantly to 79. This is the lowest demand point since February, suggesting a further softening or return to a lower baseline as the peak spring season ends. The last 5 periods (P8-P12) show demand of 136, 167, 195, 147, and 79 (avg: 144.8). Given the sharp drop in the most recent period, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the post-peak trend while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed; hence, I will maintain 'calculate' for L. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current volatility in the softening phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening further in May: Period 12 demand dropped to 79 (-50% vs April average), signaling the conclusion of the spring peak cycle.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 728162001 (Women's Jersey V-neck T-shirt) has entered a significant downward trend following the Spring peak in March/April. Most recently, demand dropped from 79 (P12) to 42 (P13), a decrease of nearly 50% week-over-week. Current on-hand inventory is 174 units, which is over 4x the most recent demand observation. Historically, actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent over-ordering and high holding costs during this post-seasonal decline, I am shifting mu_hat to a more responsive recent_N (N=3) calculation. Based on the last three periods (147, 79, 42), the average is 89.3 units. Given the inventory level of 174, this setting will cause the OR backend to withhold ordering, allowing the existing stock to deplete as the item returns to baseline demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline confirmed in May: P12-P13 demand averaged 60.5 units, a 63% decrease from the April average (161 units), signaling the end of the Spring peak cycle.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Demand for the SKU '728162001' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck) has shown a significant and sustained decline since the peak in March/April. The demand for the last three periods (P12-P14) has been 79, 42, and 50 respectively, averaging 57 units per period. This confirms a new low-demand regime following the Spring peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 127 units on-hand, which is more than double the recent average weekly demand. To minimize holding costs while maintaining sufficient service level for this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3. This focuses the forecast on the most recent 3 weeks of May demand (avg ~57), allowing the inventory level to glide down naturally without placing large new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at low-demand post-Spring levels: P12-P14 demand averaged 57 units, a 65% reduction from the April average (161 units).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/05/27) finds the SKU at the tail end of its Spring lifecycle. Historical demand has transitioned from a March peak (avg ~256) to an April plateau (avg ~161) and now a significantly lower May baseline. The last four periods of demand (P12-P15) were 79, 42, 50, and 60, resulting in an average of 57.75. This represents a stable, low-demand regime following the Spring peak. Current on-hand inventory is 67, which already covers more than one period of the current average demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current low-demand stabilization (P12-P15), which ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption rather than the massive March/April spikes. This will result in a small or zero order to avoid excess holding costs as the season concludes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at post-peak baseline: May demand (P12-P15) has averaged 58 units, a 64% reduction from April levels.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt): a baseline in January/early February (~36-50 units), a significant Spring peak in March (averaging ~256 units), followed by a softening in April (~161 units), and a shift to a lower-demand baseline in May. Demand from Period 12 to 16 has averaged 57.4 units (79, 42, 50, 60, 56), indicating the demand regime has stabilized at this lower level for early Summer. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the stable post-peak demand of the last 5 periods (mean ~57), which ensures the backend calculates a base stock sufficient for this new baseline while minimizing holding costs on excessive inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Summer baseline (early June): May/early June demand (P12-P16) has averaged 57.4 units, confirming a return to non-peak levels similar to early February.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1539.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt' (728162001) has recently spiked to 116 units (Period 17, June 3rd) after a sustained period of lower demand (averaging ~58 units in May). This indicates a potential early-summer demand lift following the post-Spring trough. I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this upward shift while balancing it against the recent lower baseline. The lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by historical data. By using recent_N (N=6) for demand parameters, I allow the OR backend to incorporate the recent low-demand periods of May while reacting to the June 3rd spike, ensuring we carry enough inventory to meet potential June growth without over-ordering as we did in April/May.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Summer lift): June 3rd (Period 17) demand rose to 116 units, a 100% increase from the May average (58 units), likely due to early summer seasonality for jersey basics.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162001 (Women's Jersey T-shirt) has entered a new Summer demand regime. We observed a significant lift starting in Period 17 (June 3), where demand jumped from a ~58-unit May average to 116 units, followed by a further increase to 151 units in Period 18. This represents a sustained upward trend likely driven by mid-summer seasonality. The last two periods average 133.5 units. Because the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are consistently stock-on-hand constrained (stocking out in P17 and P18), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 2 periods (N=2) to quickly adapt to this Summer peak, ensuring the base stock level captures the current demand velocity rather than the lower May average.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime shift confirmed: Early June (P17-P18) demand averaged 133.5 units, a 130% increase from the May average of 58 units, signaling a sustained summer seasonal peak for jersey basics.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162001 (Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt) is currently in a sustained summer demand regime shift. Early June demand (P17-P19) has consistently outperformed the May average, with the last three periods recording 116, 151, and 140 units respectively (average ~136 units). This confirms the 'Summer lift' noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To align with the current summer plateau and minimize stockouts experienced in P17 and P18, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) which capture this active summer regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the ~136 unit/period demand level rather than the lower long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime plateau confirmed: P17-P19 demand averages 135.7 units, a 134% increase from the May average (58 units).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/01. We are in a summer demand regime for this jersey v-neck t-shirt. After a significant demand lift in June (averaging ~135 units from P18-P19), Period 20 showed a dip to 98 units. This suggests the summer peak might be stabilizing or slightly cooling as we enter July. However, given the product type (Women's Everyday Basics), demand should remain relatively robust through the mid-summer months. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods. To set parameters for Period 21, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (covering P17-P20) to capture the summer trend while incorporating the recent moderation in demand. This provides a mean of ~126 units and appropriate volatility coverage for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime showing slight moderation at start of July: P20 demand dropped to 98 units after 3 weeks of averaging 135 units, though still well above May baseline (58 units).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirts' is currently in a summer seasonal phase. Period 21 saw a significant demand spike to 173 units, the highest since the March peak, following a dip to 98 in Period 20. This indicates volatility within the summer regime rather than a clean plateau. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 135.6 units. Given the high stockout in Period 21 (all 166 units sold with zero ending inventory), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this higher summer average (approx 135 units) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the recent increased variance (98 to 173). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period responsive ordering. Parameters are set to ensure the OR backend captures this higher summer baseline while protecting against the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime showing high volatility in July: Period 21 demand spiked to 173 (+76% vs previous week), following a dip to 98. 5-week summer average (P17-P21) is 135.6 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt', which is experiencing a sustained summer seasonal peak. Demand in Period 22 reached 227 units, following 173 in Period 21, indicating a significant upward volatility or a second peak within the summer season (July often sees high demand for T-shirts). The last 6 periods (P17-P22) have averaged 150.8 units, while the last 2 periods specifically averaged 200 units. Given the stockout in P22 (sold 184 vs 227 demand), I need to increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this peak and avoid consecutive lost sales. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the summer regime while acknowledging the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime accelerated in July: Demand increased to an average of 200 units over P21-P22, compared to the early summer (P17-P20) average of 126 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product, a V-neck cotton T-shirt, is in its peak summer season. Demand analysis: P21=173, P22=227, P23=221. This indicates a sustained high-demand regime, averaging 207 units over the last three weeks. This is a significant jump from the early summer average (P17-P20) of 135 units. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To ensure we capture this sustained peak while accounting for volatility, I will use a 3-period window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current regime (late July summer peak) accurately to avoid stockouts, which occurred in Period 21 and 22. Profit margin is high ($19 vs $1 holding cost), so the OR backend should prioritize high service levels.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand accelerated mid-July: P21-P23 demand averaged 207 units, a 53% increase over the early summer average of 135 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, representing mid-summer. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt) has consistently accelerated throughout July. Specifically, demand over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) was 173, 227, 221, and 246 units, respectively, yielding an average of approximately 217 units. This represents a significant and sustained increase compared to the early summer average (P17-P20) of 126 units (+72%). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this high-demand regime while maintaining a high service level (profit/holding cost ratio is 19:1), I will use recent_N with N=4 to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the current July peak levels.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand accelerated significantly through July: Demand for P21-P24 averaged 216.75 units, a 72% increase over the early summer (P17-P20) average of 126.25 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th (Period 26). In the previous period (Period 25, late July), demand dropped significantly to 92 units from a July average of approximately 217 units. This 57% drop suggests that the summer seasonal peak for this jersey t-shirt has ended, mirroring the pattern seen at the end of the spring peak. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this downturn, I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent decline (averaging ~186), but since Period 25's observation is a likely regime shift, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to forecast a continued lower demand level of 100 units (based on the Period 25 drop and previous transition behaviors). I choose N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility during this transition period. This reactive approach prioritizes reducing holding costs as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening post-Summer peak: Period 25 demand dropped to 92 units (-57% vs July avg ~217), signaling the end of the summer seasonal surge for jersey basics.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical data confirms the Summer seasonal peak for the 'Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt' occurred throughout July (P21-P24), where demand averaged ~217 units. As noted in the carry-over insights for Period 26, demand dropped significantly to 92 units in late July, signaling the end of the peak. However, Period 26 demand recovered slightly to 157 units, suggesting a higher post-peak baseline than the May baseline (~58 units), likely due to 'Back to School' or late summer replacement demand. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 2 periods (P25-P26) to capture this new, lower demand regime (average ~125 units) while filtering out the high-volume July data. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Mid-August): Summer peak concluded in late July (~217 avg); August demand has moderated to an average of 124.5 units (P25-P26), signaling a transition to a post-peak plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1479.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 728162001 (Women's Jersey V-neck) has entered a clear post-Summer peak softening phase. Following a high-demand period in July (averaging ~217 units), demand in the last three periods (P25-P27) has dropped to 92, 157, and 84 units respectively, averaging 111 units. This aligns with the 'Mid-August' regime shift documented in the carry-over insights. The Promised Lead Time is 0, and historical observations confirm actual lead time remains 0. With an on-hand inventory of 117 units and a recent average demand of approximately 111, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this most recent downward trend while maintaining a buffer for late-summer volatility. Sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=3 to reflect the current period-to-period variability since the peak ended. This configuration allows the OR backend to adjust stock levels downward to avoid excessive holding costs as seasonality wanes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed (Mid-August): Demand has stabilized at a lower post-summer level, averaging 111 units over P25-P27, a 49% decrease from the July peak of ~217.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm that the summer demand peak for this SKU (Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt) concluded in late July. Demand in August (P25-P28) has significantly moderated, averaging 105.5 units (92, 157, 84, 89) compared to the July peak which averaged over 210 units. This represents a return to a lower-demand regime as the season transitions towards autumn. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory while maintaining service levels during this post-peak plateau, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current August demand level (average ~106) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will prevent over-ordering based on the now-irrelevant July spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Summer peak: August demand (P25-P28) averaged 105.5 units, a 51% decrease from the July peak of ~217 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162001 (Jersey V-neck T-shirt) is now in a post-summer demand regime. Since early to mid-August (approx. P25/P26), demand has settled into a lower plateau compared to the July peak of ~217 units. Over the last five periods (P25-P29), demand has been 92, 157, 84, 89, and 133, averaging approximately 111 units. This aligns with the transition from summer peaks into a steady late-summer/early-autumn baseline for jersey basics. The lead time consistently remains 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=5 (P25-P29) to capture this current post-peak regime while smoothing out the volatility observed in the last few weeks (ranging from 84 to 157). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect this current volatility (std dev approx. 29) for a safe service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-summer: August/Early Sept (P25-P29) demand averages 111 units, a 49% reduction from the July peak (~217 units).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9th, 2019. Historical data for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' Jersey V-neck T-shirt indicates a highly seasonal demand pattern. We have just completed a 'post-summer' period (P25-P30) where demand averaged 121 units. However, the most recent period (P30) showed a significant jump to 170 units, potentially signaling an early autumn lift or a spike similar to the early June 'summer lift'. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent increase in demand (P29: 133, P30: 170), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the stabilization and recent slight upward trend of the post-summer regime. This covers the window since the summer peak ended in late July. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to account for the increased volatility observed in the last two weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime showing potential early September lift: Demand increased to 170 in Period 30, following a sequence of ~100-130, signaling a possible transition from the post-summer plateau.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for this V-neck jersey basic showed a significant lift in Period 30 (170) and Period 31 (166), compared to the August post-summer average of 111. This suggests a sustained early autumn demand increase, likely tied to school returns or seasonal transitions. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this recent shift while maintaining stability, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 (covering Periods 29, 30, and 31: average 156.33), which proactively adjusts for the higher demand levels observed in the last two weeks without overreacting to individual spikes. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Early September): Demand has increased to an average of 168 units over P30-P31, a 51% increase over the August post-peak plateau of 111 units, signaling an early autumn seasonal lift.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for the 'Talia' Jersey V-neck T-shirt has entered an early Autumn regime shift as previously identified. Over the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has averaged 165 units (170, 166, 160), which is a significant increase from the August post-summer plateau of ~111 units. This stability suggests the Autumn seasonal lift is sustained. Observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To handle this new regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the precise average and volatility of this current peak. I will use the default lead time of 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Demand from P30-P32 has stabilized at an average of 165 units, representing a 49% lift over the August average of 111 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30th (Period 34). Analysis of the autumn demand regime (spanning P30-P33) shows a stable average demand of 159 units per period (170, 166, 160, 140). This represents a significant and sustained lift from the August average of 111. The product, a V-neck cotton jersey T-shirt, is a versatile basic likely seeing consistent demand throughout the early autumn transition. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is currently 34 units. To maintain seasonal stock levels while managing the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this autumn regime's specific volatility and mean (approx. 159 units) without being overly influenced by the previous lower-demand August period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: P30-P33 demand has averaged 159 units, reflecting a sustained 43% lift over the August average of 111 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. Period 34 demand dropped significantly to 46 units from an 'Autumn' average of 159 units (P30-P33), representing a 71% decrease. This suggests that the early Autumn seasonal lift has ended abruptly, similar to how the Spring peak subsided in May. The carry-over insights correctly identified a sustained Autumn regime for 4 weeks (P30-P33), but Period 34 shows a sharp changepoint. I will set recent_N = 5 for mu_hat to include this drop while still accounting for the possibility of volatility, and recent_N = 5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance caused by this sudden transition. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening post-Autumn boost: Period 34 demand dropped to 46 units (-71% vs P30-P33 average of 159), signaling an end to the early Autumn seasonal lift for jersey basics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $758.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Talia V-neck T-shirt has entered a significant softening phase as of Period 34 (late Sept/early Oct). Last period's demand was 49 units, and the period before was 46, confirming a sharp decline from the Autumn peak average of 159 units. This suggests the product is entering a low-demand late-Autumn/Winter regime. With 173 units currently on-hand and recent demand averaging ~48 units over the last two weeks, we are carrying roughly three weeks of inventory. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to lean into this recent drop while maintaining a small buffer for volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level, but lowering the mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N will prevent excessive overstocking during this seasonal transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed (mid-October): Early Autumn lift has subsided; demand for P34-P35 averaged 47.5 units, a 70% decrease from the September average (159 units).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162001 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt', which has shown clear seasonal peaks in Spring (March), Summer (July), and early Autumn (September). As of Period 37 (Oct 21, 2019), we are in a post-Autumn trough. Demand in Period 36 was 90 units, an increase from the previous two weeks (46, 49), but demand remains significantly lower than the September peak (avg ~165). The Carry-over Insights indicate a sustained decline since mid-October (P35). Actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 0 periods. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent post-peak behavior (Periods 34-36 demand: 46, 49, 90) while allowing for the slight uptick observed in the latest period. This ensures we don't over-order during a low-demand phase following the autumn seasonal lift.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 28, 2019. Demand for the 'Everyday Basics' V-neck jersey T-shirt has stabilized following the end of the early Autumn lift. The last four periods (P34-P37) have recorded demands of 46, 49, 90, and 83 respectively, averaging 67 units per period. This shift represents a significant decrease from the September peak (average ~159 units). Since the product is a staple jersey basic, it appears to be settling into a late autumn/early winter baseline. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture this new stabilized demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we don't over-order based on previous higher-demand regimes while maintaining enough stock for the observed 80-90 unit weekly demand floor.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Autumn lift: October demand (P34-P37) has averaged 67 units, a 58% decrease from the September average of 159 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a post-Autumn demand regime that has recently stabilized around 80 units following the September peak. Historical data for November/December often shows a secondary rise due to holiday seasonality for 'Everyday Basics' like jersey t-shirts. Demand in Period 38 was 101 units, following an October average (P34-P37) of 67 units, confirming a slight upward trend. I will use a recent_N of 5 periods (P34-P38) to capture this recent stabilization and slight uptick, while remaining responsive to the shift from the October lows. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in late October (P38): Demand increased to 101 units (+50% vs October average of 67), potentially signaling the start of early holiday/Winter interest in jersey basics.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historical patterns suggest a transition period as we move into the holiday season. October demand (P34-P37) settled at a low baseline averaging 67 units after the Autumn peak. However, the last two weeks (P38-P39) have shown increased volatility (101 followed by 51), making the mean roughly 76. Given we are in mid-November, I expect a seasonal lift typical for basic jersey tops as customers buy layering pieces. I will use a recent window (N=6, covering P34-P39) to capture the current post-autumn stabilization while allowing for the recent slight upward trend compared to early October. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the upcoming period while maintaining a high service level (due to the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, approaching the late-November holiday period. Historical demand for this jersey basic shows significant seasonal volatility: a Spring peak (March), a Summer peak (July), and a smaller Autumn lift (September). Most recently, October demand averaged 67 units (P34-P37). Early November demand (P38-P40) has shifted slightly, averaging 77 units (101, 51, 79), likely signaling the beginning of a pre-holiday lift. Given the product's identity as an 'Everyday Basic' V-neck T-shirt, we should expect a moderate increase as shoppers look for staple items before Black Friday/December holidays. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma to capture this most recent November stabilization/lift (avg 77) while maintaining responsiveness to the high variance observed in this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Pre-Holiday lift): Early November demand (P38-P40) has stabilized at an average of 77 units, a 15% increase from the October average of 67 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the Black Friday and holiday shopping season. Historical demand for this 'Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt shows a slight lift starting in late October (P38). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P38-P41) is 73.75 units. Given the upcoming major retail event (Black Friday), a significant demand spike is expected based on general retail knowledge for 'Everyday Basics'. I will use the recent 4-period window to capture the current pre-holiday baseline while recognizing that the OR backend's service level logic (q = 0.95 based on $19/$20) will naturally buffer for the expected volatility of the holiday week. Actual Lead Time (L) consistently remains 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt' spiked to 134 units in Period 42 (Nov 25), exactly matching the timing for a Black Friday/Cyber Monday holiday lift. This is a significant increase from the previous 4-period average of ~74 units (+81%). Historically, this SKU has shown sharp seasonal transitions. Given the current date (Dec 2) and the observed spike, I am anticipating a sustained high-demand period through the holiday season. I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture this new regime immediately for mu_hat, preventing further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). For sigma_hat, I will use a slightly larger window (N=3) to account for the increased volatility observed during shifting regimes. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Holiday lift): Period 42 demand increased to 134 units (+81% vs late Oct/early Nov avg of 74), coinciding with Black Friday/Cyber Monday and likely signaling the start of the holiday peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 43 (Dec 2) dropped to 25 units. While Period 42 saw a spike of 134 (likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday), the immediate drop suggests that the pre-holiday peak was short-lived or specific to that promotional week. We are now in mid-December (Period 44), where demand for jersey basics could either fluctuate due to late gift-shopping or stabilize at a lower baseline before the year-end clearance. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 170 units due to the large order arriving just as demand dropped significantly. With a promised lead time of 0, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the high volatility of the last three periods (64, 134, 25), averaging 74.3 units. Given the high stock and lower recent demand, the OR backend will naturally scale back the order to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level based on recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: Period 42 saw a peak of 134 followed by a sharp drop to 25 in Period 43, indicating high late-Q4 variance.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), approaching the end of the simulation. Following the holiday peak (Period 42), demand has dropped significantly to 25 and 14 units in the last two periods. This aligns with the 'Holiday demand volatility' carry-over insight, suggesting a post-peak cooling period or clearance phase. On-hand inventory is currently high (156 units) due to a large order placed in Period 43 based on a spike that didn't sustain. For Period 45, the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs as the game concludes in two periods, while still maintaining enough stock to cover the low current demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-peak demand levels (average ~57.7, but weighted heavily by the most recent 14 and 25). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand collapse (P43-P44): Demand dropped from a peak of 134 (P42) to an average of 19.5 units, signaling the end of the Q4 holiday surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $253.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt' has entered a significant post-holiday slump, with the last three periods (P43-P45) recording demands of 25, 14, and 21 respectively (average ~20 units). This is a sharp contrast to the brief late-November peak of 134 units. Current on-hand inventory is 146 units, which is approximately 7x the current weekly demand. Given the item is an 'Everyday Basic' and we are now in the pre-Christmas week (Dec 23), demand is expected to remain low until the new year or early Spring refresh. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer for any small residual holiday demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 3, focusing on this current low-demand regime. This will signal the OR backend to significantly reduce ordering until the on-hand inventory is naturally depleted.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand collapse (late Dec): Demand for P43-P45 has averaged 20 units, an 85% decrease from the late November peak (134 units), returning to a low-demand baseline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162001 (Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt) is entering the final period of the year (Dec 30). Carry-over insights and historical data confirm a post-holiday demand collapse. Since Period 43 (Dec 2), demand has been extremely low, averaging 21 units (P43: 25, P44: 14, P45: 21, P46: 24). The current on-hand inventory is 122 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the expected demand for the final period given this low-demand regime (~5-6 periods of cover at current rates). The lead time remains consistently 0. I will set L to 'default' (0), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current low-demand plateau (avg 21), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the low volatility in this post-peak phase. No additional order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend as inventory (122) >> base stock.
