Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 575347003 (7pk basic sneaker socks). Historical demand samples provide data for the last 5 weeks (mean: 33.8, std: 6.1). The product is a staple item (basic socks). Period 1 begins with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, meaning we need to establish a base stock immediately to meet demand. The promised lead time is 0, which suggests same-period arrival. Since there are no observed lead times yet, I will use the default lead time (0). For demand, I will use the average of all 5 historical samples (N=5) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we cover the current period's demand (1+L = 1 period).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 34 units which arrived immediately (lead_time=0), but demand was 39, meaning we lost 5 units of sales and ended with 0 inventory. The historical data (Jan-Feb) shows demand ranging from 28 to 41, with an average of approximately 33.8. The most recent demand (P1) was 39. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)). To avoid the stockout experienced in P1 and account for the slight upward trend or volatility, I will use recent history (N=5 including Jan data) to set my parameters. The promised lead time is 0, and P1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 7pk of basic sneaker socks. Period 3 starts on February 25th. Historical data from January shows demand between 28 and 41 (average ~33.8). However, observed demand in Period 1 (39) and Period 2 (51) shows an increasing trend, likely due to the transition into spring/warmer weather where 'sneaker socks' become more relevant. In both Period 1 and Period 2, we stocked out (ending inventory = 0) because demand exceeded our on-hand inventory. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. To prevent further stockouts and capture the increasing demand trend, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the last 3 samples (41 from Jan 21, 39 from P1, and 51 from P2) to reflect the shift. Since on-hand is 0 and there are no in-transit units, the OR engine needs to order enough to cover current period demand plus a safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 7-pack of basic sneaker socks. Period 4 (2019/3/4) shows a significant demand surge coinciding with the transition into spring/warmer weather. Historical demand has risen from ~30-40 (Jan) to 51 (P2) and 62 (P3). Stockouts have occurred in all recorded periods (sold = arrived, ending inventory = 0), indicating the current ordering policy is underestimating demand. Since on-hand is 0 and lead time is consistently 0, I will use an explicit forecast to capture this upward seasonal trend and avoid further lost sales. I estimate Period 4 demand at ~75 units based on the recent trend (39->51->62). Setting L to 0 based on observed history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Significant upward trend identified from late Feb to early March (P1: 39, P2: 51, P3: 62), likely seasonal for sneaker socks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic sneaker socks', which typically sees a seasonal demand increase as weather warms up in March. Historical data showed a sharp increase from late February (D=39, 51, 62) followed by a slight stabilization at P4 (D=53). Current on-hand is 22. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. To avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 1-3, I am forecasting demand based on the recent higher-volume regime. Using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) captures the recent upward trend and peak, resulting in a mean of (39+51+62+53)/4 = 51.25. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. Setting L=0 explicitly as it matches all observed history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', which typically sees a seasonal increase in demand as spring approaches in March. Historically, demand rose from ~30s in Jan/early Feb to a peak of 62 in Period 3 (end of Feb), then settled into a mid-level regime (53 and 44 in the last two periods). Over the last 5 periods (since Feb 11), the mean demand is 49.8. On-hand inventory is currently low (8 units) with zero in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. To prevent stockouts seen in Periods 1-3, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (approx 50) and maintain a slightly higher volatility estimate to cover potential spring spikes. The OR engine's base stock calculation (Profit=1, Holding=1) will target a 50% service level, which is low for a fast-moving item; therefore, using the recent_N method captures the higher seasonal mean compared to the full historical data including Jan.

Carry-over insight: Mid-level seasonal demand regime confirmed (Avg: 49.5 over last 5 periods, vs ~32 in Jan). Demand stabilized after Feb spike.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic sneaker socks', which typically sees a seasonal uptick as spring weather arrives in March. In Period 6 (March 18), we saw a spike in demand (57), which cleaned out all inventory (ending on-hand: 0). The last 3 periods (P4-P6) show an average demand of 51.3. Given the current date of March 25, we are likely entering the peak early-spring season for sneakers and sneaker socks. Historical Jan-Feb data (average ~34) is no longer relevant for forecasting current needs. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts like in Period 6, I will set mu_hat more aggressively using the last 3 periods of data to capture this stabilized higher demand regime, and use the recent volatility to set sigma_hat.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic sneaker socks', which typically sees increased demand as spring weather arrives in April. Historically, lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory has been stocking out for the last two periods (Period 6 and 7) with ending on-hand at 0 and demand (57, 66) exceeding units ordered/available. This highlights a need for a higher service level or more aggressive mean estimation. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7: 62, 53, 44, 57, 66) averages 56.4. Given the stockouts and the transition into April, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime, while keeping L at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase confirmed entering April: Avg demand increased to 56.4 over last 5 periods (P3-P7) compared to previous avg of ~35; persistent stockouts in P6 and P7 suggest demand is currently outpacing supply.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic sneaker socks', which enters peak season during spring (April). Current data confirms a massive demand surge: Period 8 demand reached 95 units, far exceeding the previous 5-period average of ~56 units. We have experienced four consecutive periods of 100% stockouts (Periods 6, 7, 8, and starting P9 with 0 inventory), meaning true demand is likely higher than the 'sold' units. Lead time remains stable at 0. To capture this rapid seasonal growth and stop the stockout cycle, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to weigh the most recent high-demand periods (66, 95) more heavily while still including P6 (57) to mitigate extreme volatility. Given Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR system targets a 50% service level; I will use \u03bc\u0302 slightly above the recent mean to aggressively recover from 0 inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed for April: Period 8 demand reached 95 units (+44% vs P7). Sustained stockout regime (4 consecutive periods) indicates current base stock is insufficient for seasonal peak.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'sneaker socks', which are highly seasonal as the weather warms in April (Period 10, April 15). Demand has surged significantly: Period 8 saw 95 units and Period 9 saw 73 units (limited by stock, as the system sold all 73 units ordered). We have experienced 4 consecutive periods of stockouts (P6-P9), indicating that the OR backend's cap and base stock calculations are consistently underestimating the seasonal peak. Average demand since the April surge (P8-P9) is at least 84. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the recent surge and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for high volatility. Setting mu_hat to 100 (which covers the 1+L period) provides a buffer above the P8 peak of 95.

Carry-over insight: April seasonal peak confirmed: Demand surged to 95+ units; 4 consecutive periods of stockouts (P6-P9) demonstrate that historical averages are no longer sufficient for base stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (sneaker socks) is in its seasonal peak throughout April. Period 10 finally broke the 4-period stockout streak (P6-P9) because the order was aggressively increased to 100 units. Demand in P10 was 81, which is slightly down from the P8 peak of 95 but remains significantly higher than the March average (~55). On-hand inventory is currently 19 units with 0 in-transit. Since the promised lead time (L=0) has consistently held true (all orders arrive in the same period), I will maintain L=0. To ensure we capture the remaining April demand without overstocking as we approach May, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P8-P10), where demand averaged 83 units. Using N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the model to react specifically to the current high-demand regime while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at high level: Period 10 demand (81) confirms a sustained April peak regime (Avg ~83 over P8-P10) following the early April spike.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '7pk basic R sneaker socks' has reached a significant seasonal peak in late April. Period 11 saw a massive demand spike to 145 units, resulting in an immediate stockout. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the history of Period 1 through Period 11. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there is nothing in-transit. To capture this surge and prevent further lost sales, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (P8: 95, P9: 73, P10: 81, P11: 145 = 98.5). Since lead time is 0, (1+L) = 1. Therefore, mu_hat is set to approximately 100 to align with the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set explicitly to reflect the high volatility observed in April (std dev approx 32).

Carry-over insight: Significant late-April demand surge confirmed: Period 11 demand reached 145 units, nearly double the early April average (~83). The seasonal peak is more volatile and intense than initially projected.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 demand was 130, following Period 11's 145, confirming a sustained high-demand regime for late April/early May for sneaker socks. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The last two periods (P11-P12) show a significant jump in demand compared to the early April average (~83). To capture this peak and avoid further stockouts (which have occurred in 7 of the 12 periods), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to reflect the current 130-145 demand level. Given the high volatility (145 to 130), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the increased variance of the April/May peak compared to the stable March period. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: May high-demand regime confirmed: Demand for P11-P12 averaged 137.5 units, significantly higher than the early April average (~83). High volatility persists during this seasonal peak.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-13. The SKU is 'sneaker socks', which are highly seasonal as the weather warms (April/May). Recent demand history indicates a significant peak in late April (P11: 145, P12: 130), followed by a drop in Period 13 (88). Period 13 finally ended a long streak of stockouts, resulting in 50 units of ending inventory. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P11-P13) is 121 units. Given the seasonality of sneaker socks, demand is likely to remain elevated throughout May but may begin to stabilize or show high volatility. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To account for the recent volume while acknowledging the lower P13 demand, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current seasonal regime (avg ~121) rather than the all-time average (~77). This ensures the base stock remains high enough to prevent returning to the stockout regime seen in P11-P12.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in May: P13 demand (88) dropped 32% from the late April average (~137), but remains 50%+ higher than March levels, suggesting a sustained but highly variable high-demand season.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical data for this sneaker sock SKU shows a clear seasonal progression: January (avg ~32), March (avg ~53), and a high-demand peak from mid-April through May. Demand in the last four periods has been 145, 130, 88, and 95, showing high volatility but a sustained elevated floor. The most recent demand (P14: 95) suggests the regime is currently fluctuating around 90-110 units as we move deeper into the warm season. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will prioritize the most recent 4-period regime (P11-P14) which captures both the extreme volatility and the actual realized demand of the current high season. Setting L to calculate confirms the 0-period trend. mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 will capture the higher mean (~114) and standard deviation required to protect against the observed volatility in this product category.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. We are in the midst of a high-demand seasonal peak for sneaker socks, characterized by extreme volatility and frequent stockouts. Last period (P15) saw demand (131) significantly exceed supply despite an order of 89 units, resulting in an ending inventory of 0. The demand over the last four periods (P12-P15) has been 130, 88, 95, and 131, averaging 111. This period (P16) occurs at the end of May/beginning of June, a typical peak for summer apparel accessories. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent high-volume regime while acknowledging the volatility, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4, focusing specifically on the May volatility (P12-P15). This targets a base stock level that can accommodate demand spikes around the 130-unit level.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime peak: Average demand for P12-P15 is 111 units with high volatility (range 88-131). Stockouts continue to occur when base stock falls below 130.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. Historical data (P11-P16) shows sneaker socks are in a high-demand seasonal peak, with demand reaching 153 units last period and an average of 115.4 units over the last 5 periods (P12-P16). We have experienced frequent stockouts (P11, P12, P15, P16) because the base stock calculation, constrained by historical averages, is trailing the actual demand surge. The critical profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), implying a service level target of 0.50 (z=0), meaning the OR engine will target the mean demand. Given the high volatility (std dev ~24) and recent peak, a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat is chosen to capture the most recent high-demand regime (May-June) while filtering out the lower March/April data. L=0 is consistently observed in history, so we stick with 'calculate'. This configuration aims to raise the base stock to approximately 115-120 units to minimize lost sales during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Early June demand peak confirmed: Period 16 demand (153) is the highest recorded, indicating the seasonal peak for sneaker socks continues to intensify into June. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has risen to 115 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks is currently in a high-demand seasonal peak (June). Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) averages ~114 units, but significant volatility exists, with peaks reaching 153 units (P16). Period 17 saw a slight dip to 105, but this is still within the high-demand regime established in May/June. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this volatile peak, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 6 periods (P12-P17, avg \u2248 117) to capture both the peak and the recent variability. I am using recent_N=6 to encompass the full range of the June/late-May surge. The OR backend's service level logic (q = 0.5 given Profit=1/Holding=1) and the cap mechanism will help balance the risk of holding costs against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Mid-June demand regime: High volatility persists during seasonal peak (P12-P17 range 88-153, avg ~117); stockout risks remain high without aggressive base stock coverage.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', which exhibits strong seasonality peaking in the spring and early summer. As of Period 19 (mid-June), demand remains high but volatile. The last five periods (P14-P18) show demand values of 95, 131, 153, 105, and 87, averaging 114.2 units. While the last two periods (105, 87) suggest a slight cooling from the early June peak (153), the demand is still significantly higher than the early spring base. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts during this high-demand season against holding costs, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this current June regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the current high volatility (std dev ~27). L is set to 'calculate' as historical lead times have stayed at 0, which the backend will confirm.

Carry-over insight: Mid-June demand regime: Demand shows signs of slight cooling from early June peak but remains in a high-sustained regime (Avg 114 over P14-P18) compared to March/April levels.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '575347003' (sneaker socks) remains in a high-demand seasonal regime as of late June. Period 19 demand spiked to 148 units, following a volatile period where averages shifted from 117 to 114 and back up. The last 5 periods (P15-P19) show demands of 131, 153, 105, 87, and 148, resulting in a mean of 124.8 units. The continuous occurrence of stockouts (P15, P16, P19) indicates that previous base stock settings based on lower averages were insufficient for the volatility and peak demand levels. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To better capture this high-volatility, high-demand summer period and prevent further stockouts while balancing holding costs (Profit $1/Holding $1 implies a 50% service level target in the base stock logic), I am using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to focus on the current June demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Late June demand surge: Period 19 demand (148) confirms the seasonal peak persists with high volatility (P15-P19 Avg: 124.8). Demand has not yet cooled as of June 24.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has reached a new peak in late June (Period 20: 198 units), which is the highest demand recorded to date. The 'Carry-over insights' correctly identified a sustained high-demand regime, but recent data shows and even more dramatic surge (Avg last 5 periods P16-P20: 138.2). With a promised lead time of 0 periods (consistently confirmed by history), we must carry enough stock to meet this elevated, volatile demand. Period 20 ended in a stockout despite ordering 125 units, indicating that our base stock level is still lagging behind actual demand. I am setting mu_hat to explicitly account for this recent surge (140-150 range) and increasing sigma_hat to 45 to protect against the high volatility observed (range of 87 to 198 in the last 5 periods). A critical service level is needed because the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, but the backend OR logic will cap orders, so an explicit approach ensures we capture the peak demand while it's active in July.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge in late June/early July: Period 20 reached a new record of 198 units. Average demand for the core sneaker sock season (P16-P20) has risen to 138.2 units with extreme volatility.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '575347003' (sneaker socks) is in its peak summer season (July 8th). Recent demand is extremely high and volatile: P20 reached 198 and P21 reached 158. The current base stock calculation is consistently under-ordering, leading to frequent stockouts (P19, P20, and P21 all resulted in ending inventory of 0). The last 5 periods (P17-P21) have an average demand of 139.2 units with a high standard deviation. Because profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, but the capped policy mechanism in the OR backend requires a more aggressive mu_hat and sigma_hat to prevent constant stockouts during this peak. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the recent surge, which sets mu_hat to (1+0)*139.2 and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+0)*std(105, 87, 148, 198, 158). Lead time (L) remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Early July peak sustained: Average demand for P17-P21 is 139.2 units; demand remains high but volatile entering mid-July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '575347003' (7pk sneaker socks) is currently in its peak seasonal period (late spring/summer). Analysis of the last 6 periods (P17-P22) shows a high-demand regime with a mean of 136.5 units (105, 87, 148, 198, 158, 123). Historically, the peak occurs between June and July. Although Period 22 demand (123) was lower than Period 21 (158), it remains significantly above spring levels. On-hand inventory is low at 17 units. Considering the high volatility (sigma) observed during this peak (approx 36.9) and a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (suggesting a 50% service level target by default), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current peak regime's mean and standard deviation. This ensures the base stock (mu + z*sigma) is calculated using current high-volatility parameters rather than diluted historical data, protecting against the frequent stockouts seen throughout June.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 7pk of sneaker socks, which shows high seasonality during summer. We are currently in late July (P24), following a peak season that saw demand reach up to 198 units. Recent history (P21-P23) shows demand stabilizing slightly but remaining high compared to March/April levels (P21: 158, P22: 123, P23: 126). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 135.6 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' ordering where we can respond quickly to demand shifts. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the OR backend targets a 50% service level by default (z=0). To prevent stockouts during this volatile high-demand phase, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current regime which includes the record peak and the subsequent stabilization, ensuring the mu_hat reflects the current triple-digit demand environment. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility observed in July.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand stabilization: Period 22 and 23 demand (123, 126) suggests a slight cooling from the late June/early July peak (~150-200) but remains in a high-sustained regime twice the level of spring demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 7-pack of sneaker socks, which shows strong seasonal demand through the summer months. Current date is late July (Period 25). Reviewing recent history: Period 20 peaked at 198 units, followed by a slight cooling in July with demand values of 158 (P21), 123 (P22), 126 (P23), and 117 (P24). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) is 131 units, down from the peak but still significantly higher than spring levels. Since demand is stabilizing at this new high plateau (~120-130 range), I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining high enough stock to prevent the frequent stockouts seen in June. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for Period 25 (79 units) shows a significant decrease compared to the mid-July levels (~120 units), indicating the start of a post-peak seasonal decline for sneaker socks as August begins. The average demand over the last four periods (P22-P25) is approximately 111 units, but the most recent data point (79) suggests a downward shift. Current on-hand inventory is 52 units. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this slowing momentum while maintaining a buffer for late-summer activity. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 will allow the OR backend to react to the slowing demand while honoring the 50/50 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand decline confirmed: Period 25 demand dropped to 79 units, a 32% decrease from the P22-P24 average (~122), signaling the end of the high-summer peak for sneaker socks.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks is cooling down as we move into mid-August (Period 27: 2019/08/12). Historically, demand peaked in June/July (averaging ~140 units) and has recently shown a downward trend: P25 (79) and P26 (106). The average over the last 3 periods is approximately 95 units, compared to the summer peak average of 140+. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs at the end of the season, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect this lower regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this immediate post-peak volatility and mean. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods based on all previous 26 observations.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand decline sustained: Late July/early August demand (P25-P26 avg: 92.5) is ~34% lower than the early July peak (~140), confirming a transition out of the high-summer regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '575347003' (Socks & Tights) is currently in a post-peak downward trend as of late August (Period 28). The high-summer peak (late June/early July) saw demand consistently over 150 units, but recent weeks (P25-P27) show a stabilized lower regime with demand values of 79, 106, and 81. The average demand over these last 3 periods is approximately 88.6 units. Given the transition out of the peak season, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this lower volume and avoid over-ordering and incurring high holding costs (which equal the profit margin). Sigma remains high proportionally to account for the intrinsic volatility of the product line. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (sneaker socks) entered a post-peak seasonal decline starting in late July. Demand in the most recent four periods (P25-P28) follows a lower trend: 79, 106, 81, 67, averaging 83.25 units. This is a significant drop from the high-summer peak (P20-P21) which saw demand reach nearly 200 units. The current date is late August, which traditionally marks the end of the summer season for lightweight apparel like sneaker socks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory as demand cools further, I am setting mu_hat to be based on the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture this downward trend rather than using a longer history which includes the summer peak. Sigma_hat is also calculated over these 4 periods to account for the reduced but still present variability in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime shift confirmed: August demand (P25-P28 avg: 83.3) is significantly lower than early July levels (~140+), indicating the end of the high-summer season.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (7pk sneaker socks) is entering the post-summer 'cooling' phase as of early September. Demand has consistently decelerated from the mid-summer peak (approx. 140+ units in July) to a more stable late-August level. The last five periods (P25-P29) show demand values of 79, 106, 81, 67, and 59, representing a clear downward trend and a new lower-demand regime compared to June/July. The average over these last five periods is 78.4 units. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (since Profit $1 = Holding Cost $1, the target service level is 50%, making precision in mu_hat critical), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this cooling trend. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift: Demand continues to decline from summer peaks; P25-P29 average is 78.4, down from ~122 in July. The seasonal cooling for sneaker socks is now firmly established.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (sneaker socks) is in a clear seasonal decline phase as we enter September. Demand has consistently dropped from the summer highs (mid-July avg ~140) to a more stable autumn regime. The demand for the last five periods (P26-P30) was 106, 81, 67, 59, and 52, which averages 73 units, but the most recent three periods (P28-P30) show an even lower average of 59.3 units with a clear downward trajectory. Given the date (Sept 9) and the nature of sneaker socks, further cooling is expected as temperatures drop. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend while maintaining a small buffer for volatility. L remains 'calculate' as historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September cooling trend confirmed: Demand has dropped by ~38% from the late August average to the early September average (P26: 106 vs P30: 52).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-September cooling phase for sneaker socks. Current demand has dropped significantly from the summer peak (avg ~140 in July) to a more stable low-volume regime. Period 30 and 31 demand (52, 42) confirms this decline. The current on-hand inventory is 31 units. Given the transition into autumn, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (P28-P31: 67, 59, 52, 42), which yields an average of 55. This captures the immediate downward trend more effectively than a longer-term average. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 31 historical conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~50 units (P30-P31 avg: 47), representing a 60% decrease from July peak levels.

LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', which has completed its high-summer plateau and is now in a clear autumn cooling phase. Recent demand for September (P30-P32) has stabilized at approximately 48 units (52, 42, 51). This is a significant drop from the summer average of ~138 and the August average of ~78. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory as the season winds down, I am choosing the last 3 periods (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This captures the most recent demand regime (approximate mean of 48.3) while filtering out the higher August/Summer values. Starting on-hand inventory is low (4 units), so the backend will order slightly more than the base stock to replenish positions.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~48 units (P30-P32), representing a ~38% decrease from August levels and ending the high-summer seasonality.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 575347003 (sneaker socks) experienced a stockout in Period 33, with demand spiking to 74 units from a previous 3-period average of ~48. This suggests periodic late-September volatility or a minor end-of-month rally even as the overall summer peak has ended. The 'conclude' message for Period 33 confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (ordered 45, arrived 45 in the same period). On-hand inventory is currently 0. To prevent another stockout while respecting the lower post-summer baseline, I will use a recent window that captures the latest cooling trend but adjusts for the recent spike. I am choosing N=4 to cover the September sessions (P30-P33), which averages ~55 units per period. Setting L to default (0) as same-period delivery is consistently observed.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. Demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from the high-summer peak (July/August) into a stabilized autumn regime. Recent demand values are: P30 (52), P31 (42), P32 (51), P33 (74), and P34 (43). The spike in P33 (74) appears to be an outlier or a minor late-September variance, as the surrounding periods consistently hover around 45-50 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 52.4 units, which is a significant drop from the summer average of 130+. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this cooling trend while accounting for the recent variability. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to provide a tighter safety stock consistent with the reduced volume. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a lower level following the summer peak, with a 5-period average (P30-P34) of 52.4 units, a 60%+ reduction from the early July peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', entering mid-October (2019-10-14). Demand has moved from its summer peak (up to 198 units) to a stabilized autumn regime. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P30-P35) is approximately 54.5 units (52, 42, 51, 74, 43, 65). While significantly lower than summer, it remains higher than the initial Jan/Feb baseline of ~35, and exhibits moderate volatility (Std Dev ~12.5). A stockout occurred in P35 because starting on-hand (53) was slightly below actual demand (65). Given the promised lead time remains 0 and consistently arrives as such, a base stock reflecting the recent 6-period regime (P30-P35) will balance service level against the $1.00 holding cost. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this October stabilization.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a sustained post-summer demand cooling. Currently entering late October (2019/10/21), demand for sneaker socks has stabilized significantly lower than July peaks. Period 36 demand was 33 units, following values of 65, 43, 74, and 51. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P30-P36) is approximately 51.4 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs in this declining/stable regime, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current October baseline (approx. 51 units/period) and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the moderate volatility seen in late Sept/Oct (demand ranging from 33 to 74). This balances the need to meet occasional spikes while acknowledging the lower seasonal mean.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime stabilized: P30-P36 average demand is 51.4 units, confirming a consistent lower-level plateau following the summer peak and initial September drop.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (men's sneaker socks) is currently in a stabilized post-summer demand regime. Demand since early September (P30 to P37) has averaged 51.5 units, which is significantly lower than the July peak (avg ~140) but consistent for the autumn season. Current lead time matches the promised 0 periods (confirmed in P37 conclusion). With profit and holding costs equal, the target service level is 50%, requiring base stock to align closely with the expected mean demand. However, historical volatility and a recent stockout in P37 (demand 55 vs. on-hand 52) suggest a slightly higher safety buffer is needed to avoid lost sales, especially as recent demand (P33: 74, P35: 65, P37: 55) periodically exceeds the 5-period average. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the stabilizing autumn trend (starting from P30) and using a similar N for sigma_hat to reflect current variance.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is sneaker socks, entering early November (Period 39: 2019/11/4). Demand has stabilized significantly after the summer peak, with an average demand of approximately 50-55 units over the last 9 periods (P30-P38). Specifically, demand in the most recent five periods (P34-P38) has been 43, 65, 33, 55, and 47, averaging 48.6 units. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (5 units) and there is no inventory in transit, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (N=5) to maintain the current lower-level seasonal plateau while accounting for the recent range of 33-65 units. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to capture this recent volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that prevents the minor stockouts seen in Periods 35 and 37.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is entering mid-November. Looking at the trend since October (P35-P39), demand has been consistently lower than the summer peak, averaging around 47 units (65, 33, 55, 47, 35). There are no upcoming major shopping holidays visible in the immediate data that would suggest a pre-Black Friday spike for basic sneaker socks, though general volatility remains. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this stabilized late-autumn demand regime, which helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering based on the high summer averages while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the periodic volatility seen in P37 (55 units).

Carry-over insight: November demand regime: Average demand for P35-P39 is 47 units, confirming a stable low-season baseline following the post-summer decline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', entering late November (2019/11/18). Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that we are in a stable, low-demand regime following the summer peak. Demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) has been 33, 55, 47, 35, and 39 units, averaging 41.8 units. This is slightly lower than the October average of 47-51 units, confirming a continued slow descent into winter for sneaker socks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods (ordered and arrived same period). I will use a recent_N window of 6 to capture the mid-October to mid-November stability (P35-P40 avg ~42) while excluding the higher volatility from the late September transitional period. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), so the OR backend will target the median demand (0.5 service level) to balance inventory risk.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime shift: Average demand has decreased to 41.8 units (P36-P40), down from the ~51 unit average observed in October, reflecting typical late-autumn cooling for sneaker socks.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the late-autumn period for sneaker socks, where demand is generally lower and stabilizing after the summer peak. Period 41 demand was 46, and the previous five periods (P37-P41) had demands of 55, 47, 35, 39, and 46, averaging approximately 44.4 units. This aligns with the 'Nov demand regime shift' noted in the carry-over insights. Since the lead time remains verified at 0 periods, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture this stabilized late-autumn demand (Avg ~44.3) for mu_hat. This window focuses on the relative stability observed since late October (P36 onwards). I will also use N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect the moderate volatility seen in recent weeks (ranging from 35 to 55). The base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) needs to cover the current period's demand, and since on-hand inventory is 0, the backend will place an order to meet this target.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We have entered Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). Period 42 showed a massive demand spike of 101 units, which is significantly higher than the November average (~41 units) and our previous projections. Given the date (early December), this is clearly a Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact or the start of the holiday gifting season for basic items like 7-pack sneaker socks. The previous inventory (43 units) was completely sold out. Since the promised lead time is 0 and consistently arrives on the same period, I must set the base stock to cover this new, higher demand level immediately to avoid further stockouts during the December peak. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to 110 (2 * 55) to reflect a sustained or increasing holiday demand, as 101 was a significant jump from the baseline.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed at Period 42: Demand reached 101 units (+140% vs P41), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday and December seasonality for basic retail items.

Period 43 demand (41 units) reflects a post-peak lull, but we must stay prepared for the final pre-Christmas surge. The 7pk basic sneaker socks are likely a high-demand gift or basic refill item during December. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to maintain a buffer that accounts for potential holiday volatility, targeting a value that supports the higher end of recent demand observations (~80-100 units) to avoid stockouts seen in Period 42, while sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the sharp increase in volatility seen during this period.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: Period 42 saw a 140% spike (101 units), followed by a Period 43 lull (41 units), typical of the Black Friday vs. early December transition.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-December (2019-12-16). Historical demand for this SKU (sneaker socks) showed a massive spike in P42 (101 units) corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, followed by a significant lull in P43 (41 units) and P44 (45 units). However, we are entering the peak Christmas shopping week. Based on typical retail patterns, demand is likely to rise again for last-minute gifts before tapering off post-Christmas. My goal is to maintain sufficient stock for a potential pre-Christmas surge while avoiding excess inventory heading into January, which is historically a low period (starting at ~30 units in Jan/Feb). Current on-hand is 65 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (covering the spike and the lull, average ~62) to provide a balanced buffer that accounts for both the holiday volatility and the baseline demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: December holiday volatility confirmed: P42 spike (101) followed by P43-P44 lull (avg 43); anticipating secondary pre-Christmas surge before January cooling.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the Christmas shipping and shopping season. Historical demand for the last few periods (P42-P45) has been volatile: 101, 41, 45, 64. Period 45 showed a significant rise to 64 units, signaling the expected pre-Christmas surge. Given that sneaker socks are often bought as basic gifts or stocking fillers, demand in P46 (Christmas week) is likely to remain high or increase further before the January cooling. The on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit). Lead time has consistently been 0. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method (N=4) to capture the high December average (approx 63 units) and ensure the base stock is high enough to meet the final holiday peak. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility observed between the Black Friday spike and subsequent weeks.

Carry-over insight: December pre-Christmas surge confirmed: Period 45 demand increased to 64 units (+42% vs P44), confirming seasonal relevance for sneaker socks during the final holiday shopping week.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, which is the final week of the year and transition into January. Historically, Period 1 (early Feb) demand was 39, and most of Jan/Feb was in the 30-40 range before the spring surge. Recent data shows a holiday spike (P42: 101) followed by a stabilization/secondary surge (P45: 64, P46: 55). As the holiday season ends, demand is expected to cool significantly back towards early-year levels. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (averaging ~61) to capture the recent high volatility while allowing for the downward trend. Sigma_hat is set with 'explicit' to 35 to account for the high variance observed during the December peaks and ensure enough buffer for any lingering New Year demand before the full January drop-off.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday cooling expected: December demand showed significant volatility (P42-P46 range 41-101), but historical data from Period 1 suggests a return to a ~40 unit baseline in January.
