Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for high-waisted skinny jeans. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend over the last 5 weeks, growing from 1 unit in early January to 34 units by early February. This suggests a seasonal ramp-up as we approach spring. The promised lead time is 0. Given the rapid shift in demand, I will focus on the most recent 3-week window (N=3) to capture the current momentum (averaging ~26 units/period) rather than the long-term historical average (16.4), ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the current demand level. As on-hand and in-transit are both 0, an immediate order is necessary.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 34 units which arrived immediately (lead_time=0), but demand was 43, resulting in a stockout (sold 34, 9 lost sales) and 0 ending inventory. This indicates the initial forecast was too low. Historical demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' shows a clear upward trend: 1, 3, 27, 17, 34, then 43 (in Period 1). This is likely due to the transition into the spring denim season in February. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 (27, 17, 34) plus the current P1 demand (43) to capture this rising trend. mu_hat will be set to (1+L) * average of recent periods. Since L=0, this is just the mean of the recent demand. To prevent further stockouts during this growth phase, I will use an explicit sigma_hat set slightly higher than the recent standard deviation to provide a safety buffer.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 (Skinny Jeans) is experiencing a sharp demand surge. Historic pre-game demand was low (avg ~16.4 per week), but actual demand in P1 was 43 and in P2 plummeted into a massive stockout with 179 units demanded. This correlates with the 'Ankle-length' style's seasonal appeal as we move towards spring (late February). The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, inventory is 0. To capture this growth, I'm setting mu_hat explicitly to provide enough stock for the current period's expected high demand (forecasting a continuation of the P2 trend) and using a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed between P1 and P2 levels. The goal is to maximize sales despite high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: avg jumped from ~16 to 110+ (+580%) driven by seasonal demand for ankle jeans.

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ankle Queens' jeans, which characterizes high-growth seasonal demand as spring approaches (March). Observation of the last three periods (P1-P3) shows a massive shift from early Jan/Feb levels (mean ~17) to a new regime (P2 demand: 179, P3 demand: 136). The average demand over the last two periods is ~157. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume regime while ignoring the low-volume January data. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 100+ units/week demand rather than the historical average of ~40, preventing stockouts during this peak seasonal window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $157.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of ladies' ankle-length jeans. Demand in early periods (prior to 2019-02-11) was low (avg ~16), but has spiked significantly as we move into the spring season. The history shows a high-demand regime starting Period 2 (demands: 179, 136, 67). Although Period 4 saw a dip to 67 units, this follows a Period 2 peak, suggesting high volatility during the seasonal transition. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory currently stands at 111 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. To ensure we capture the remaining seasonal demand while managing the high volatility (sigma), I will use the recent_N method based on the 4 observations of the active season (Periods 1-4) to forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach targets the new mean of ~106 units/period and adjusts for the high variance observed in recent weeks.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' experienced a massive demand spike starting Feb 11 (Period 1), which aligns with early spring retail seasonality for ankle-length denim. However, the last two periods (P4 and P5) show a significant cooling of demand (67 and 35 units respectively) compared to the peak weeks (179 and 136 units). The current on-hand inventory is 124 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand of 35. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for the seasonal regime, I will pivot to a 'recent_N' approach (N=3) for demand. This captures the lower demand of the last two weeks while still factoring in one high-demand week to hedge against resurgence. Lead time (L) remains confirmed at 0 based on historical 'conclude' messages (P1-P5).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility observed post-peak: demand dropped from 136 (P3) to 35 (P5). Monitoring to see if the seasonal peak has passed or if this is a temporary dip.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product (Ladies Ankle Jeans) is exhibiting post-peak seasonal volatility. After a significant demand spike in Period 2 (179 units), demand has stabilized at a lower level: 136, 67, 35, and 52 over the last four periods. The 'carry_over_insight' noted a shift from ~16 to 110+, but the most recent 3 periods (P4-P6) show an average demand of 51.3 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), overstocking is expensive. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. I will use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this cooling demand regime and avoid excessive inventory holding while still maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (std dev of ~16 units in the last 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Post-peak demand (P4-P6) has leveled to an average of ~51 units, down from the P2-P3 peak average of ~157 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' experienced a massive seasonal peak in February (Periods 2-3) which has since subsided. Demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P4-P7) at an average of 48.75 units (67, 35, 52, 41). Current on-hand inventory is 31 units with zero in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am targeting a base stock level grounded in this post-peak demand regime. Using N=4 for mu_hat captures this stabilization period perfectly, setting the forecast at approximately 49 units. Given the high volatility observed during the transition from peak to stable (std dev is significant), I will use N=4 for sigma_hat as well to ensure an adequate safety buffer as we move further into the Spring season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), demand spiked to 99 units, causing a stockout as we only had 61 units on-hand. This spike breaks the previous stabilization trend (~51 units) noted in Period 7. Historically, late March/early April marks the start of spring/summer fashion transitions, which explains the renewed interest in 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens'. The observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and capitalize on this secondary demand surge, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 (Periods 6-8: 52, 41, 99) to capture this upward shift, which yields an average of ~64 units. Given L=0, mu_hat will be set to (1+0)*64 = 64. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility from this recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected in early April: Demand rose from avg ~46 (P6-7) to 99 (P8), likely reflecting spring seasonal interest in ankle-length denim.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' experienced a significant demand surge in Period 8 (99 units) and a subsequent drop in Period 9 (32 units). This volatility (avg 65.5 over the last two periods) coincides with early April, a period where spring fashion demand for ankle-length jeans tends to be erratic as weather transitions. The carry-over insights correctly identified a surge, but the latest data shows high variability. On-hand inventory is currently 58 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the April 1 spike while protecting against future surges, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 (covering Periods 6-9), which yields an average demand of 56 units. This balances the stabilization period with the recent volatility. I'll use a conservative sigma estimate (recent_N=4) to account for the high standard deviation observed across this period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 11 (2019/04/22), the SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' is entering late April. Historical data shows a significant demand surge in early April (Period 8: 99 units), followed by a sharp decline in the last two periods (Period 9: 32, Period 10: 23). This suggests the spring peak for these ankle-length jeans may have passed, returning to a lower baseline similar to the mid-March levels (avg ~43). The current on-hand inventory is 59 units, which covers more than two weeks of the most recent demand levels. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%, meaning we want to avoid excessive overstocking as the season potentially winds down. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent post-peak slowdown (Avg: 51.3), and L at the promised lead time of 0 as arrivals have consistently been same-day.

Carry-over insight: Post-spring peak decline: Demand dropped from 99 (P8) to an average of 27.5 units in P9-P10, indicating the seasonal interest in ankle jeans may be tapering off in late April.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (skinny ankle-length jeans) is showing consistent signs of a post-peak seasonal decline as we move into late April/early May. Demand has stabilized at a lower level: the last three periods (P9, P10, P11) recorded demand of 32, 23, and 24 units respectively, resulting in a three-period average of 26.33 units. This is a significant drop from the early April spike of 99 units. Inventory is currently sufficient (On-hand: 63), covering more than two periods of the current average demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid accumulating excess inventory during this tapering phase, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the current lower demand regime, and sigma_hat similarly to capture the reduced volatility of this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed for late April (P9-P11): mean demand has settled at ~26 units, reflecting a post-spring seasonal decline from previous surges.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and the product (ankle-length skinny jeans) is likely entering a post-spring plateau or further decline as the weather warms up and fashion preferences shift. Historical demand for the last four periods (P9-P12) has been very stable: 32, 23, 24, and 22 units, with a mean of 25.25. The carry-over insights confirm this stabilization at a lower level (~26 units) compared to the early April surge. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I am setting L=0. Since the demand has entered a stable regime after the spring peak, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current late-spring demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the or-backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected lower demand while minimizing holding costs for the ending inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P10-P13) shows a clear downward trend and stabilization at a lower volume: 23, 24, 22, and 8 units. This confirms the 'post-spring peak decline' noted in the Carry-over Insights, as the weather warms and demand for ankle-length denim likely tapers off further. The current on-hand inventory is 33 units, which is significantly higher than the most recent demand (8 units) and the average of the last 4 periods (~19.25 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (ratio is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am lowering the demand forecast to reflect this recent decline. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (avg ~19), which will target a base stock around that level. Given that on-hand (33) exceeds the expected demand for the next period, the OR backend will likely place a zero or very small order, which is appropriate to burn off excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new seasonal low in Period 13 (8 units), suggesting a deeper tapering than previously estimated in P12.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens) is in a post-spring seasonal decline. The current date is May 20, 2019. Historically, demand spiked in February and early April but has since stabilized at a lower level. Over the last five periods (P10-P14), demand has been 23, 24, 22, 8, and 23. This averages to approximately 20 units per week. Although Period 13 saw a significant low (8 units), Period 14 bounced back to 23, suggesting the 'tapering' mentioned in the previous carry-over insight hit a floor rather than continuing to decrease toward zero. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 10 units. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture this settled post-peak behavior, ensuring we maintain enough stock to cover the expected 20 units per week without overstocking and incurring holding costs ($1/unit).

Carry-over insight: Demand floor established: Post-peak demand has stabilized at an average of ~20 units (P10-P14), despite a one-week dip in P13.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/05/27), demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' jeans has stabilized at a lower seasonal level. Over the last 6 periods (P10-P15), demand has been {23, 24, 22, 8, 23, 18}, resulting in a mean of 19.6 units. The product is categorized as ankle-length denim, which typically peaks in early spring (seen in March/April) and tapers as summer temperatures rise. The current on-hand inventory is 8 units with 0 in-transit. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a service level of 80%. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the stabilized post-peak demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets approximately 20-25 units for the upcoming period while respecting the recent low of 8 units to avoid overstocking during this slow phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16 (2019/5/27), demand spiked unexpectedly to 93 units, a significant jump from the established 'demand floor' of ~20 units seen in P10-P15. This suggests a new seasonal surge, possibly related to early June summer shopping for ankle jeans. Our on-hand inventory was completely depleted, resulting in significant lost sales (sold 25 vs demand 93). Given this sudden jump, I am shifting from the previous stable regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture this immediate shift for mu_hat, as the change is too abrupt for a longer average. For sigma_hat, I will use N=3 to capture the increased volatility including this spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: New seasonal demand surge detected starting Period 16 (2019-05-27): demand jumped from avg ~20 to 93 (+365%), marking a shift from the late-spring plateau.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Ankle Queens' (skinny ankle-length jeans) is currently experiencing a sustained early-summer demand surge. After a stable low-demand period (avg ~20), demand jumped to 93 in Period 16 and was 69 in Period 17 (average of 81 units over the last 2 periods). This pattern mirrors previous seasonal surges observed in February and April. The current on-hand inventory is 60 units, which is below the expected weekly demand for this high-demand regime. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on history. I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for this seasonal surge, using the mean of the last two surge periods (81) as the base for (1+L) demand. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the inherent volatility of these sudden shifts. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated sales rate while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand surge confirmed (Period 16-17): average demand increased to ~81 units (+300% from previous floor) mirroring previous seasonal spikes for ankle denim.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (skinny ankle jeans) is currently in an early summer demand surge, though demand has eased slightly over the last two periods from a peak of 93 (P16) down to 69 (P17) and 52 (P18). The mean demand over the last 3 periods (P16-P18) is 71.3 units, signaling a significantly higher regime than the May floor of ~20 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the consistent history of same-period arrivals (e.g., P18 ordered 54, arrived 54). With current on-hand inventory at 62 units and recent demand showing a downward trend from the P16 peak, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current summer surge average (~71 units per period). This approach ensures we maintain a base stock that accounts for the current regime's volatility and prevents stockouts seen in P16, while the OR backend's inventory balancing will recognize that 62 units are already on hand.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand stabilization: Following the P16 surge (93 units), demand has moderated to a 3-period average of 71 units (P16-P18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits significant seasonal demand spikes followed by moderation. We are currently in a mid-summer regime following an early-summer surge. The last four periods (P16-P19) show demand values of 93, 69, 52, and 68, resulting in a mean of 70.5 units. The most recent three periods (P17-P19) show a slight cooling from the peak (69, 52, 68), averaging 63 units. Given the seasonality of ankle-length jeans in June, demand is likely to stay within this stabilized 'summer plateau' rather than returning immediately to the floor of 20 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To ensure high service level given the volatility in these surges (std dev ~17), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P16-P19) to capture the current active regime accurately.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (Ankle-length jeans) is currently in a summer seasonal demand phase. Period 20 (late June) saw a significant demand surge to 99 units, causing a stockout (sold 85 of 85 available). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Data from the last 5 periods (P16-P20) show a sustained higher demand regime with an average of approximately 76 units (93, 69, 52, 68, 99) and higher volatility compared to the earlier late-spring floor. Given the stockout in P20 and the clear seasonal interest in ankle-length denim during early summer, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this higher mean (~76) and sigma_hat also on recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent based on historical conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand surge and volatility confirmed: Period 20 demand reached 99 units, resulting in a stockout. High-demand regime (avg ~76) sustained through June (P16-P20).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 is experiencing a significant summer demand surge. Period 21 saw the highest demand since February (132 units), resulting in another stockout with zero ending inventory and zero in-transit. Demand has been consistently high and volatile over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), with an average of 85.5 units and two peaks over 100. Given this is early July (2019/7/8), we are in the peak of summer seasonal demand for ankle jeans. To maximize profit and prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the inventory holding cost, I am shifting the mu_hat focus to the most recent 'high-demand' regime (N=6, covering the surge from late May to July). I will use explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent elevated mean (85.5) and the volatility (std \u2248 30) observed during this peak period. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak intensified in Period 21: demand reached 132 units, confirming a high-demand regime from P16-P21 with an average demand of 85.5 units and high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $375.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand was 97 units, following a peak of 132 in P21. We are currently in a high-demand summer regime (July) for ankle-length jeans. The last 7 periods (P16-P22) have seen a mean demand of 87.1 units (93, 69, 52, 68, 99, 132, 97) with high volatility (std dev ~26). We stock out frequently when demand exceeds 90. Given the high-demand regime is sustained through July, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this peak summer level and its associated volatility. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment based on the decision-phase order. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%, meaning we should carry enough stock to cover the expected mean plus a buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand peak confirmed: July (P21-P22) demand average is 114.5 units, significantly higher than the June (P17-P20) average of 72 units. The high-demand regime remains active.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 is currently in a sustained high-demand mid-summer regime. Demand for July (P21-P23) has maintained a very high average of 118.3 units (132, 97, 126), compared to the June average of ~72 units. The stockout in Period 23 (inventory 110 vs demand 126) confirms the inventory depth is insufficient for this peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this high-demand July phase and mitigate further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost, I will focus on the most recent 3 periods (P21-P23) to set mu_hat. This targets the current peak rather than the lower June numbers. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility (standard deviation ~18) observed during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer peak intensified in July: Period 21-23 demand average reached 118.3 units, a ~64% increase over the June average of 72 units. The high-demand regime remains active with increased volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (High-Waisted Ankle Jeans) is currently in a sustained high-demand mid-summer regime (June-July). For Period 24 (2019-07-22), demand was 74 units, a noticeable decrease from the preceding weeks (132, 97, 126), yet still significant. The current on-hand inventory is 61. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture the current high-demand volatility while accounting for the recent slight softening, I will use recent_N with N=9 (covering the start of the summer surge in late May/Period 16 to the present). This helps the OR backend establish a robust base stock that balances the high profit margin ($4.0) against the holding cost ($1.0), ensuring adequate service levels for the remainder of the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand softening: After a peak average of ~118 units in early July (P21-P23), Period 24 demand dropped to 74 units, though it remains well above the spring baseline of ~20 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), we are in the late-summer period. Historical performance for the 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' shows a sustained high-demand regime throughout July (P21-P24 average ~107 units), with P25 demand remaining robust at 90 units. Although there was a slight dip in P24 (74 units), the subsequent demand of 90 units suggests that the summer peak hasn't fully dissipated. Lead time has consistently validated at 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering periods 21-25) to capture the current high-demand average (approx 103.8) and its associated volatility. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock high enough to prevent the stockouts witnessed earlier in the summer (P20, P21, P23) while adjusting to the slightly lower volume seen in the transition from July to August.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime continues into August: Period 21-25 average demand is 103.8 units, maintaining the elevated summer levels despite earlier fluctuations.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (Ankle-length jeans) is currently in a high-demand summer regime that started in late May (Period 16). Since Period 21 (July 1st), demand has remained consistently high, averaging 102.1 units over the last 6 periods (P21-P26: 132, 97, 126, 74, 90, 94). Although there was a dip in P24 (74 units), the demand in P25 and P26 has stabilized back near the 90-100 range. Given we are in mid-August (2019/8/12), I expect this high-demand summer pattern to continue for a few more periods before a late-summer/early-fall taper. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent sustained high-demand regime while accounting for its inherent volatility (Std Dev \u2248 21), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the localized mean of ~102 units and ensures the base stock calculation accounts for recent fluctuations to prevent stockouts like those seen in P20, P21, and P23.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (Ankle-length jeans) is currently in a sustained high-demand summer regime. Since Period 21 (early July), demand has remained consistently high, averaging 94.4 units per period (P21: 132, P22: 97, P23: 126, P24: 74, P25: 90, P26: 94, P27: 79). Although there is a slight downward trend in the last few periods (94 to 79), demand remains significantly elevated compared to the spring baseline (~20 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this current high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the ongoing summer demand while the 0-period lead time allows for rapid adjustment if a downturn occurs in late August.

Carry-over insight: High-demand summer regime (P21-P27) confirmed with an average demand of ~94 units, significantly higher than spring levels (~20 units).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 is currently in a sustained high-demand summer regime. Period 28 demand was 102 units, consistent with the July-August (P21-P28) average of approximately 95 units. We are at the end of August (2019-08-26), where demand for ankle-length denim remains substantial but may face an upcoming seasonal transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (16 units), and there is zero in-transit inventory, requiring an order to maintain service levels. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the duration of the summer peak P21-P28) to capture the current mean of ~95.3 units. For sigma_hat, N=8 will also be used to account for the high volatility observed during this period (std dev ~18.5). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current demand level while managing the inventory risk associated with possible stockouts.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand summer regime for ankle jeans has been remarkably stable. Over the last 9 periods (P21-P29), demand has averaged 97.1 units with consistent volatility (std ~18.8). As we enter September (P30, 2019/9/2), there is a historical precedent for seasonal shifts, but no evidence yet of a slowdown in the current year's data. Period 29 demand (80 units) is slightly lower than the recent average but within the normal variance of this regime. I will use the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this sustained high-demand summer regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Setting parameters based on this regime continues to support a high service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Summer high-demand regime extends through late August (P21-P29) with a mean of ~97 units and std ~19.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (skinny ankle jeans) is entering early September (2019-09-09). Historical demand shows a sustained high-demand summer regime (P21-P30) with an average of approximately 93 units. However, Period 30 showed a significant drop to 57 units, which may signal the beginning of a post-summer seasonal decline, similar to the tapering observed after the spring peak in late April. Given the product's seasonality (ankle jeans are typically popular in spring/summer), I will transition from the summer peak average to a slightly more conservative forecast to avoid overstocking while holding costs are relatively high ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit). I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the high summer average while beginning to weight the recent drop, but I will adjust sigma_hat with a recent_N of 5 to better reflect current high volatility (standard deviation remains high during regime transitions). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Potential end of summer high-demand regime; Period 30 demand (57) dropped ~40% below the summer average of 97. Monitoring for sustained decline in September.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 636323002 (Ankle Jeans) is showing a clear seasonal decline as we move into September. In Period 30, demand dropped to 57 units, and in Period 31, it dropped further to 37 units. This confirms the 'Potential end of summer high-demand regime' noted in the Period 31 Carry-Over Insight. The average demand during the peak summer regime (P21-P29) was approximately 97 units. The last two periods (P30-P31) average 47 units. Given the transition into late September, I expect demand to continue tapering towards the spring/baseline level (avg ~20-30 units). I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this downward trend while preventing an over-adjustment to a single low data point. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 71 units, which covers approximately two periods of the current lower demand level. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent evidence will help the OR engine avoid over-ordering during this seasonal wind-down.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal decline confirmed: Demand in September (P30-P31) has dropped to an average of 47 units, down 50% from the summer peak average of 97 units (P21-P29).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal decline for ankle-length jeans in late September (P33) is confirmed. Demand in the last three periods (P30-P32) has been 57, 37, and 36 units, respectively, which is significantly lower than the summer average of ~97. The mean demand for these last three periods is approximately 43.3 units with a standard deviation of ~11.9. We are currently in a lower-demand regime as autumn approaches. Current on-hand inventory is 41 units, which nearly covers the current mean demand. To prevent overstocking during this downward trend while maintaining a sufficient service level (q = 0.8), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most current demand behavior (P30-P32). Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal decline confirmed (P30-P32): Demand mean dropped to ~43 units (-55% from summer peak), reflecting the end of high-season for ankle jeans.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for ankle jeans is continuing its downward seasonal trajectory as we exit September. Period 33 demand was 40 units, following a trend in September (P30-P33) with an average of 42.5 units. This is a significant drop from the summer high-demand regime, which averaged ~97 units. The product description (ankle-length jeans) suggests that interest naturally wanes as colder weather approaches. Currently, we have 14 units on-hand. Given the clear shift to a lower-demand regime, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to capture the September stabilization (P30-P33 average is 42.5). The lead time remains consistently 0. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent four-week window will allow the OR backend to right-size the inventory for the autumn season and avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' is an ankle-length denim product, which is highly seasonal. Historically, it experienced significant surges in demand during spring (February/March) and summer (June-August). We are currently in early October (Period 35). Based on the history, demand has significantly decelerated following the summer peak. Demand for the last five periods (P30-P34) has been 57, 37, 36, 40, and 34, resulting in a mean of 40.8 units. The most recent three periods (P32-P34) show even tighter stability around 34-40 units (mean ~36.7). Given that we are entering mid-autumn, a further seasonal decline or stabilization at this lower floor is expected. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this low-demand phase while maintaining a sufficient service level, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current post-summer regime. This covers the transition from September into October.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: September-October (P30-P34) demand has stabilized at a mean of ~41 units, confirming the end of the summer high-demand regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-10-14. The SKU (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens) has transitioned from its high-demand summer regime (P21-P29, mean ~97) into a stable autumn regime starting in September (Period 30). Demand for the last 6 periods (P30-P35) has been consistent: 57, 37, 36, 40, 34, 36. This results in a stable mean of approximately 40 units with significantly lower volatility than during the summer peak. We are setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this specific autumn regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 13, and there is no pipeline inventory, necessitating an order to reach the base stock level for the current regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 is currently in an autumn demand stabilization phase after the summer high-demand peak. Period 36 demand was 24, which is slightly lower than the Period 30-34 average of ~41, but consistent with a seasonal cooling. The carry-over insights correctly identified a stabilization around ~41 units, but recent weeks (P34-P36: 34, 36, 24) suggest a possible further drift downward as we move deeper into October. For Period 37, I will use a conservative window (N=7) to capture this recent behavior (P30-P36: 57, 37, 36, 40, 34, 36, 24). This averages ~37.7 units per period. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting L to default (0), mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to align with the current autumn regime and its stabilization characteristics.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Autumn demand cooling continues; Period 34-36 average (31.3 units) suggests a slight downward drift from the previous Period 30-34 stabilization mean of 41 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (skinny ankle jeans) is currently in a seasonal decline phase following its summer peak. The period enters late October (P38). Recent demand history shows a stabilized but slightly softening trend: P30-34 averaged ~41 units, while P34-37 has stabilized further at a mean of ~32 units (P34:34, P35:36, P36:24, P37:35). The 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 37 correctly identified this drift. Given the high-waisted ankle-length design, demand is expected to remain relatively low but stable as cooler weather continues, before potentially hitting a winter floor. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent window of N=4 to capture this current late-autumn stabilization (mean ~32). Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to reflect current volatility levels. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, so I will continue using the 'default' method for L.

Carry-over insight: Autumn stabilization confirmed (P34-P37): Demand mean has settled at ~32 units, reflecting a post-summer seasonal low for ankle-length denim.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for ankle-length jeans has stabilized in a post-summer, autumn regime. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 30.8 units (34, 36, 24, 35, 25). This confirms the 'Autumn stabilization' noted in carry-over insights. The Promised Lead Time (L) remains 0, consistent with the historical actual lead times observed. Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for demand mean and volatility acknowledges this stabilized regime while filtering out the high-volume summer data. Current on-hand inventory is 12, which is below the expected demand for the upcoming period, requiring a replenishment order to maintain service levels for this SKU.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' is currently in a stable autumn demand regime. After the significant summer peak (avg ~97 units), demand has dropped and stabilized over the last 6 periods (P34-P39) at an average of 30.5 units (34, 36, 24, 35, 25, 29). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. We are currently in mid-November (2019-11-11), which has not shown any new seasonal spikes in the historical data provided. Given the target service level (Profit of $4 vs Holding Cost of $1), I will use a recent_N approach for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 focusing on the last 6 stable periods (N=6) to ensure we cover the current demand regime without being skewed by the high summer volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans', which has shown several seasonal regime shifts throughout the year. We are currently in a stable late-autumn phase. Period 41 starts on 2019-11-18. Since the autumn stabilization was confirmed in Period 38 (monitoring P34-P37), recent demand has remained consistent. Demand for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) has been: 24, 35, 25, 29, 24, averaging 27.4 units per period. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will set L to 'default' (0) and mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stable, slightly lower demand level compared to the early autumn period. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. This approach balances the risk of stockouts against holding costs for this post-peak period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 42 (2019-11-25). Demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' (ankle-length denim) has stabilized in a post-summer/autumn regime. Over the last four completed periods (P38-P41), demand has been 25, 29, 24, and 31 units respectively, resulting in a mean of 27.25 units. This reflects a slight moderation from the previous stabilization level of ~32 units noted in Period 38. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 1 unit on-hand with 0 in-transit, following a high-sales period (31 units). I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this current late-autumn demand level (approx 27 units), which allows the OR backend to replenish stock to meet the expected demand + safety stock while minimizing holding costs for this lower-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand stabilization (P38-P41): Demand has settled at a mean of ~27 units, a further slight decline from the ~32 unit mean observed in the P34-P37 window.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (2019-11-25), demand spiked significantly to 62 units, more than double the late-autumn average of ~27 units. This surge corresponds with Black Friday/Cyber Monday week, which typically sees high demand for denim products. I am identifying this as a significant seasonal event rather than a permanent regime shift. However, following the stockout in Period 42 (Ending On-hand: 0), I need to set parameters that capture both this peak volatility and the likely immediate post-event demand. I will use a recent_N of 5 to include the lead-up and the peak (P38-P42), which averages ~34 units. This ensures the OR backend raises the base stock above the previous autumn floor of 27 to account for potential late-holiday shopping or remaining promotional traffic. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Late-November seasonal demand spike confirmed (Period 42 demand: 62 units, +130% from the P38-P41 mean of 27), likely linked to Black Friday sales events.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 42 (2019-11-25) spiked to 62 units, confirming a seasonal event (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Period 43 demand returned to a lower level of 24 units, which is consistent with the late-autumn stabilization mean of ~27 observed prior to the spike. As we approach mid-December (Period 44, 2019-12-09), demand for ankle-length denim is expected to remain at this lower baseline or potentially soften further due to colder winter weather. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the current on-hand inventory of 24 units and cover the rest of the game (ending at Period 47), I will use the recent stabilization mean for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=5 (Periods 39-43) captures the stabilization while weighting the recent holiday volatility appropriately to maintain a safe service level without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand return: Following the Period 42 spike (62 units), demand in Period 43 (24 units) has returned to the previous autumn baseline of ~27 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019-12-16). Demand for ankle-length jeans typically stabilizes at a lower seasonal baseline during this period, following the Black Friday spike (P42). Period 44 demand (15 units) suggests a continuation of this post-holiday cooling, even lower than the previous autumn baseline of ~27 units. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4, covering P41-P44) for mu_hat to filter the P42 outlier while reacting to the recent downward drift (averaging ~33 units, but significantly lower in the last two weeks). Considering the product's high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and the fact that we are nearing the end of the simulation (P47), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized, lower-demand regime to avoid left-over inventory. Actual lead time has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand return confirmed: Following the Black Friday spike in P42, demand has averaged 19.5 units over P43-P44, suggesting a return to or slightly below the autumn baseline of ~27 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 (Ankle-length jeans) is currently in a stable low-demand regime following the late-November (Black Friday) spike. The most recent demand samples (P43: 24, P44: 15, P45: 21) confirm a return to the post-autumn baseline. Over the last three cycles, demand has averaged 20.0 units with relatively low volatility. Given the date is Dec 23rd, we are entering the final week of the year; historical patterns for this item show no significant late-December surge, although general retail trends may cause minor fluctuations. I will set the demand mean (mu_hat) using a recent window of N=3 to capture this stabilized 'floor' of ~20 units. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect current low volatility, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order during this post-seasonal lull while maintaining a sufficient service level for any minor holiday-related variance.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Historical demand for this ankle-length denim SKU shows a distinct return to a low-demand baseline following the brief Black Friday spike (Period 42: 62 units). Over the last four periods (P43-P46), demand has averaged 17.75 units (24, 15, 21, 11), confirming that the autumn/winter stabilization period continues. This aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 45. There is no evidence of a year-end/New Year demand surge for this category. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 19 units and the recent average demand of approximately 18 units, the safety stock needs to be adjusted to reflect this stable, lower-demand regime. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this most recent post-holiday behavior while providing enough buffer for minor fluctuations. Lead time remains set to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period performance.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday stabilization confirmed (P43-P46): demand has averaged 17.75 units, returning to or slightly below the late-autumn baseline of ~27 units.
