  "rationale": "Product 574109012 is a 'Rachel LS TVP', described as a fine rib knit sweater with long sleeves. Given the date (Feb 11), we are in the late winter/early spring transition, which usually sees high demand for light knitwear. Historical data shows a significant demand spike of 198 units on 2019-01-21, though the most recent two weeks (Jan 28, Feb 4) have averaged around 64 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available for this period's demand. I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately plus maintain a buffer for Period 2. Based on recent demand (approx 60-70) but acknowledging the possibility of volatility (historical peak of 198), I will target an order that covers the immediate demand and establishes a safety stock. Ordering 120 units provides enough for roughly two weeks of current average demand (60/week) or covers a potential moderate spike.",
