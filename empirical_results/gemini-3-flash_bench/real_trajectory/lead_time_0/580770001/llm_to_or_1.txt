Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is a 'Kai jumper', a cotton-blend sweater for women. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend (106, 133, 203, 165, 156), which is consistent with early spring demand for knitwear. The average demand across the last 5 samples is approximately 152.6. Given we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the promised lead time is 0, we need to establish a base stock that covers the upcoming period's demand. I will use the recent 5 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level, while keeping L at default (0) as per the promised lead time, pending observation of actual lead times in future concluding periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' cotton-blend sweater. Historical demand over the last 6 weeks (including Period 1) shows a general upward trend: 106, 133, 203, 165, 156, and 117. The demand in Period 1 (117) was lower than previous weeks, but since this is an 'Everyday' item in late February, demand is expected to remain relatively stable as we transition towards spring. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the current actual lead time matches the promised lead time. I will use the last 5 samples (including the most recent) for forecasting to capture the current demand level while smoothing out the volatility observed in late January/early February. Mu_hat and Sigma_hat will be set using the recent_N method with N=5.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, transitioning from late winter into early spring. The product is a 'soft, rib-knit cotton blend jumper' from the 'Womens Everyday Collection'. Based on historical data (Jan/Feb) and the last two periods, demand is relatively steady but showing a slight downward trend from a peak in late January (203 units) to recent levels (~110-120 units). Period 1 demand was 117 and Period 2 was 109. Given that promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0 (Period 1 and 2 arrivals were immediate), L is set to 'default'. For demand (mu_hat), the recent period average (N=2) is approximately 113. However, considering the full history, the mean is higher (~140). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), the OR backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5. To avoid overstocking in a high-holding-cost environment for a seasonal item that may begin to see less demand as spring approaches, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent stabilization between 110-160, avoiding the earlier January spikes.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-03-04 (Period 4). The product is a rib-knit cotton blend jumper, which typically sees steady demand in late winter/early spring. Historical demand samples (including pre-game data) show a mean of 137.4 units. However, recent demand in the game periods (P1: 117, P2: 109, P3: 60) shows a downward trend, specifically a sharp drop in Period 3. This could be seasonal (transition into warmer spring weather) or a temporary fluctuation. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (P1, P2, P3) confirm an actual lead time of 0. Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5 (z*=0), meaning the backend aims for the median. To prevent overstocking during this apparent demand dip, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to capture the current trajectory, while using the full history for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' cotton knit jumper. Historical demand shows a significant decline from early weeks (samples: 106, 133, 203, 165, 156) to more recent levels (Period 1: 117, Period 2: 109, Period 3: 60, Period 4: 38). This suggests a post-winter/seasonal drop as the weather warms in March. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 4 concluded cycles, matching the promised lead time. Given the clear downward trend in the last two weeks, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture this softening, while keeping lead time (L) as default. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the reduced volatility in the lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 3: Average demand decreased from ~140-150 units to ~50 units (~65% reduction) as the product moves out of peak winter season.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. The product is the 'Kai jumper', a cotton-blend sweater. Historical demand shows a clear downward trend as we move further into spring: Period 1-2 (Feb) averaged 113 units, Period 3-4 averaged 49 units. However, Period 5 saw a sudden spike to 88 units, which led to a stockout (ending inventory 0). This spike may be late-season volatility or mid-month variability rather than a sustained trend reversal, given the product type (knitwear) and the warming weather in March. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To recover from the stockout while remaining cautious about the general seasonal decline, I will use recent_N for both mean and volatility to capture the more recent variability (low demand in P3-P4 followed by the spike in P5). Setting N=3 for demand and volatility covers the period since the initial seasonal drop, capturing the current post-peak regime and the recent volatility spike.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Kai jumper' (soft, rib-knit cotton blend), which is seasonally aligned with late winter and early spring. We are now in late March (Period 7: 2019/3/25). Previous 'Carry-over insights' noted a significant demand drop starting Period 3 as the winter peak passed. Historical demand for the last four periods has been: 60, 38, 88 (stockout limited sales to 69), and 45. Averaging these four periods (60+38+88+45)/4 gives 57.75 units. Period 5 demand was likely higher than 69 (actual 88), suggesting the floor is slightly higher than 50. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods across all 6 recorded historical interactions. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the post-peak demand regime (averaging ~58 units per period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility. With profit ($1.0) equal to holding cost ($1.0), the backend will aim for a 50% service level (z*=0), balancing the risk of stockouts against holding costs as the season winds down.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a 'soft, rib-knit cotton blend' boat neck jumper. We are deep into the spring season, away from the winter peak seen in January/early February. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime. The carry-over insight noted a shift around Period 3/4. Looking at the last 5 periods (P3-P7), demand has been: 60, 38, 88, 45, 51. The spike in P5 (88) was an outlier compared to the surrounding weeks. The average of these 5 periods is 56.4. The lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this post-peak demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need for enough data to estimate volatility while ignoring the irrelevant high-demand winter peak in P1 and P2.

Carry-over insight: Post-winter stabilization confirmed: Demand from Period 3 onwards (P3-P7) fluctuates around a mean of ~56 units/week, significantly lower than the P1-P2 average of ~113 units/week.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a cotton-blend rib-knit jumper, which is transitioning from winter into the spring season. Demand has stabilized into a lower-volume regime compared to the early February peak. Historical demand from Period 3 to Period 8 shows an average of ~58 units per week (60, 38, 88, 45, 51, 67). Although Period 8 demand spiked to 67 units, causing a stockout (ending inventory 0), the overall trend remains significantly lower than the winter peak. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 8 concluded periods. To avoid holding excess inventory as temperatures rise further, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=6) to capture the post-winter average, and set lead time to 'calculate' based on the perfect history of 0-period arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a rib-knit cotton blend jumper, which is transitioning from winter into the spring season. Historical demand shows a clear structural break after Period 2 (February 18), shifting from ~113 units/period to a more stable low-season average. Since Period 3, demand has averaged 56.7 units per period (samples: 60, 38, 88, 45, 51, 67, 41), although it remains somewhat volatile. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded observations. To accurately capture the current demand regime while accounting for recent variability, I will use a window of the last 7 periods (N=7, covering P3 through P9) to estimate both the mean (mu_hat) and the standard deviation (sigma_hat). Given L=0, the OR backend logic for mu_hat will use (1+0) * mean of recent_N samples, aligning with our current localized demand estimate.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Kai jumper' is a knitwear item transitioning from early spring into late April. Demand has continued to decline as temperatures rise, with the most recent sample (Period 10) showing only 26 units, the lowest observed yet. The previous 'stabilization' around 56 units is now trending downwards towards a lower baseline for the warmer months. I will use N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this cooling trend (average demand over P6-P10 is ~46 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for 'Just-in-Time' inventory management. Setting L to default matches this observed 0-period lead time. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR engine doesn't over-order based on the high-demand winter data from early February.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Demand is trending lower than the previous stabilization (mean of 46 over last 5 periods vs earlier mean of 56), likely due to seasonal transition out of knitwear.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, late spring, and the product is a 'Kai jumper' (knitwear). Demand has shown a consistent downward trend as temperatures rise: P1-P2 averaged 113, P3-P8 averaged 58, and the most recent three periods (P9-P11) averaged 30.6 (41, 26, 25). This decline aligns with the seasonal transition away from sweaters. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in a declining season, I will adjust the mu_hat to reflect this recent low-demand regime using N=3 (P9-P11). The sigma_hat will also be adjusted to this window to reflect current volatility. This conservative approach balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by preventing excess inventory of a seasonal item.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Late spring seasonal decline confirmed; demand for 'Kai jumper' dropped from a mid-season average of ~58 to a recent 3-period average of ~31 units/week.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Kai jumper' is a knitwear item entering May (Period 13), which is late spring. Demand has logically declined as warmer weather approaches. The historical mean has shifted from ~56-58 (mid-season) to a lower regime. The last 3 periods (P10-P12) show demands of 26, 25, and 44 (mean ~31.7). The spike to 44 in Period 12 caused a stockout (ending inventory 0). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level. I will use the recent 3-period demand average to set mu_hat, capturing the lower late-spring demand levels while acknowledging the recent volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Kai jumper', which is a knitwear item. As we progress into mid-May (Period 14), demand is expected to remain low due to warming weather. Historically, demand has declined significantly from the early year peak (~113/week in Feb) to a lower stabilization point. Most recently (Periods 11-13), demand has averaged 37.3 units (25, 44, 43). Although there was a slight uptick in the last two periods compared to Period 11, the overall trend for knitwear moving towards summer is downward or stabilized at a low level. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs for a seasonal item in decline, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period demand window (mean \u2248 37) and use recent volatility for sigma_hat.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '580770001' (Kai jumper) is at the end of its spring season as we enter late May (Period 15). Demand has been consistently lower than early-year peaks, though it has stabilized slightly above the record lows of P11. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand has been {25, 44, 43, 38}, averaging 37.5 units/week. This suggests the previous 'regime shift' toward ~31 units was slightly conservative, but a significant decline from the mid-season average of ~58 remains. Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To handle the current demand level without overstocking as summer approaches, I will set mu_hat using a recent window of 4 periods to capture this stabilized late-spring demand (avg ~38), and use corresponding volatility metrics. Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the OR backend's service level target (q) will be 0.5, aiming to keep just enough stock to meet expected demand while minimizing leftover inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at end-of-season: From P12-P14, demand for the Kai jumper has averaged ~41 units, showing a slight recovery from the P11 low of 25 but remaining ~30% below mid-spring levels.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019, which is late spring moving into summer. The product is the 'Kai jumper', a cotton-blend knitwear item. As noted in the carry-over insights, demand has declined from over 100 units/week in winter to a stabilized lower level in late spring. Analysis of the last 4 periods (P12-P15) shows demand values of 44, 43, 38, and 39 respectively, which is remarkably stable with a mean of 41. Previous stocking levels (around 38 units) have led to stockouts in 4 consecutive periods (P12-P15) where ending inventory was 0 and sales were capped by availability. This indicates the demand forecast should be slightly higher than the recent sales figures to capture the latent demand. I will set the lead time to its promised 0 periods based on consistent historical performance (all orders P1-P15 arrived with L=0). I will use the recent 4-period window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect this current late-season stabilization while allowing for a slightly higher base stock to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at ~41 units/week during late spring (P12-P15). Consistent stockouts in P12-P15 suggest current stock levels are slightly under-serving latent demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a rib-knit cotton blend 'Kai jumper', which is a seasonal knitwear item heading into the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Historical data shows a clear downward trend in demand since the peak winter periods (P1-P2 avg: 113) to a stabilized late-spring average (P12-P16 demand: 44, 43, 38, 39, 42). In the last 5 periods (P12-P16), the average demand has been 41.2 units. Crucially, the system has experienced stockouts in every period from P12 to P16 (sold units = starting on-hand), meaning the 'true' demand is likely higher than the observed 'sold' values. The inventory consistently hits zero because the order quantity (calculated by the OR engine based on previous parameters) was too conservative for the actual demand realization. To capture this latent demand and prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the late-season decline, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5), as this represents the current stabilized regime including the recent stockouts. I will use the 'default' lead time (0) and sigma calculation to allow the OR engine to manage the safety stock for this period.

Carry-over insight: Sustained stockouts observed from Period 12 to Period 16: Observed 'sold' units are capped by available inventory, indicating that latent demand is slightly higher than the recent average of 41 units/week despite the summer transition.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is the 'Kai jumper', a cotton-blend knitwear item. Period 17 saw a significant drop in demand to 18 units, compared to the previous five-period average of ~41 units. This drop likely signals the final transition into summer months where demand for knitwear/jumpers hits a seasonal low. Previous insights noted consistent stockouts from P12-P16, but P17 ended with 24 units on-hand, indicating that demand has finally fallen below our constrained supply. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which equal profit at $1.0), I am lowering mu_hat to reflect this new lower demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to weigh the recent lower demand more heavily while still accounting for the volatility (sigma_hat) using a slightly longer window (N=7) to capture the recent transition from stockouts to surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Demand for knitwear decreased from a constrained average of ~41 units to 18 units, signaling the start of the summer seasonal trough.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019, which is late spring/early summer. The product is the 'Kai jumper', a knitwear item. As noted in the Carry-over Insights, we have entered the summer seasonal trough for this category. Demand dropped significantly in Period 17 (18 units) and Period 18 (22 units) after a period of constrained demand around 41 units. The average demand over the last two periods is 20 units. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level (z=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 14 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs during this low-demand summer period, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 2-period demand trend to capture the seasonal trough, while keeping sigma_hat reflective of recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough confirmed: Demand for knitwear has dropped to an average of ~20 units/week (P17-P18) from the previous late-spring average of ~41 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product, a 'Kai jumper' (knitwear), has entered its summer trough as expected. Demand in the last three periods (P17-P19) has dropped significantly to 18, 22, and 13 units (average ~17.7 units/week). This aligns with seasonal expectations for a cotton-blend sweater in late June. Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) accounts for this recent drop while ignoring the higher, inventory-constrained demand from mid-spring. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on current volatility during this low-demand phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (same-period arrival). With Profit=1 and Holding=1, the service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median demand. On-hand inventory is currently 7.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough confirmed: Demand for knitwear (P17-P19) has stabilized at a lower average of ~18 units/week, down from the late-spring average of ~41 units/week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a cotton-blend 'Kai jumper' (knitwear/sweater) entering early July (mid-summer). Since Period 17, demand has dropped significantly from a late-spring average of ~41 to a summer trough average of ~16.25 (18, 22, 13, 12). Period 20 demand was 12 units. Given the seasonal relevance of a sweater in July, demand is expected to remain at this structural low. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 (covering the summer trough period: P17-P20) to capture this lower mean of 16.25. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), the target service level (q = profit / (profit + holding_cost)) is 0.50, meaning the base stock will target the median demand. I'll also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the current reduced volatility in the summer trough.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. We are in the middle of summer, which is the seasonal trough for knitwear (Kai jumper). Reviewing the most recent demand data: Period 17 (18 units), Period 18 (22 units), Period 19 (13 units), Period 20 (12 units), and Period 21 (4 units). The demand has significantly dropped, even compared to the late June stabilization, likely due to a mid-summer sales lull or extreme heat reducing desire for jumpers. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 13.8 units/week. However, the last period's demand of 4 units is a potential outlier or a sign of further decline. To avoid overstocking during this low-demand season where holding costs equal profit ($1), I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this trough while smoothing out the very low P21 data. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Summer seasonal trough further intensified; demand dropped to an average of ~13.8 units/week (P17-P21) from the previous late-spring average of ~18-20 units, with a notable low of 4 units in P21.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/15, deep into the summer season for the 'Kai jumper' (a knitwear item). Demand has been in a sustained trough since approximately Period 17. While Period 22 saw a demand rebound to 24 units, the previous 5 periods (P17-P21) averaged only 13.8 units. The spike in P22 may be a minor fluctuation or a clearance-related boost, but given the product type (rib-knit cotton blend jumper) and the July date, a sustained high demand is unlikely. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to a stockout in P22. I will set parameters based on the recent 6-period summer regime (P17-P22) to capture the low seasonal demand while accounting for the recent spike. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Summer trough volatility observed; after 5 periods of low demand (avg ~14), P22 saw a rebound to 24 units, but overall demand remains ~60% lower than late spring levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is the 'Kai jumper', a knitwear item currently in the deep summer trough (late July). Historical performance shows a significant drop from spring levels (~41 units/week) to a summer average of approximately 15-18 units units/week over the last 7 periods (P17-P23). Specifically, demand since Period 17 has been: 18, 22, 13, 12, 4, 24, 17. The recent periods (P22-P23) show higher demand than the extreme low of 4 in P21, but consistent stockouts in P22 and P23 (sold < demand/start on-hand) indicate latent demand is likely slightly higher than the actual units sold. To balance the $1/$1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level via the base stock formula), I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current summer stabilization. Setting N=7 covers the entire summer regime from Period 17 to Period 23. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a knitwear item ('Kai jumper') currently in its summer seasonal trough. Over the last 8 periods (P17-P24), demand has averaged approximately 15.3 units/week (18, 22, 13, 12, 4, 24, 17, 11), with significant volatility. The most recent demand was 11 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 5 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. To capture this summer regime while accounting for the high volatility (IQR of 11-20), I will use the recent_N method with N=8 (the duration of the summer trough) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures our base stock level is responsive to the current low-demand environment but provides enough safety buffer for sudden spikes like the 24 units seen in Period 22.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th (Period 26). The product is a rib-knit cotton blend jumper, which is currently in its summer seasonal trough. Over the last 9 periods (P17-P25), demand has stabilized at a low level, averaging 15.3 units per week, including recent demand figures of 17, 11, and 12. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels during this low-demand phase, I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the summer regime starting from Period 17.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Summer trough demand for the Kai jumper has remained stable over the last 9 periods (P17-P25) with an average of 15.3 units/week. This confirms a consistent low-demand regime for late summer.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-12. The product is the 'Kai jumper', a knitwear item. We are currently in the summer trough, but Period 26 saw a significant spike in demand to 41 units (though sales were capped at 15 due to stockout). This spike, occurring in mid-August, likely signals the early start of the 'Back to School' or 'Pre-Autumn' transition, as demand for knitwear typically begins to recover from summer lows at this time. The previous 9-period average (P17-P25) was 15.3 units, but P26's demand of 41 units is a clear signal of regime change. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this upward movement while balancing it against the previous low-demand weeks. Since lead time has consistently been 0, I will use that for L.

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn transition detected at Period 26: Demand for knitwear spiked to 41 units (from a summer average of ~15), indicating the end of the summer trough and the beginning of seasonal recovery.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The 'Kai jumper' is entering the Autumn transition. Demand spiked significantly in the last two periods: Period 26 (41 units) and Period 27 (53 units), compared to the summer trough average of ~15 units. This confirms a rapid return to knitwear demand as we move into late August. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in P26 and P27, where potential demand (41 and 53) far exceeded our conservative summer-based orders. To address this upward shift and prevent further lost sales, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this immediate Autumn ramp-up (mean of P26-P27 is 47 units). I will use explicit sigma_hat to account for high volatility during seasonal transitions, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to rebuild inventory for the growing demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition confirmed: Significant demand spike in P26 (41 units) and P27 (53 units), averaging 47 units/week, up from the summer trough average of ~15 units (+213%). Transition indicates inventory needs must scale rapidly.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '580770001' (Kai jumper) has entered a clear autumn recovery phase as we move into late August. Demand in the last three periods (P26-P28) was 41, 53, and 54 units respectively, representing a 250%+ increase from the summer trough average of ~15 units. Current inventory is zero, and we have experienced stockouts for the last three consecutive periods, meaning latent demand is likely even higher than the observed sales. To avoid further lost sales during this seasonal ramp-up, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime, while using an 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility and ensure the OR backend sets a higher base stock. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand ramp-up confirmed: Demand for P26-P28 averaged 49.3 units, with substantial stockouts in all three periods, indicating latent demand likely exceeds 55+ units/week as we enter peak sweater season.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (early September), entering the peak autumn/winter season for knitwear. History shows demand for the 'Kai jumper' spiked in late August (Periods 26-29: 41, 53, 54, 48 units), with a 4-period average of 49 units even with three consecutive stockouts. Because Period 29 was fully satisfied (demand 48, sold 48, ending inventory 2) and demand dropped slightly from the P27-P28 peak of 53-54, we are seeing a high-volume stabilization rather than an infinite ramp-up. To capture latent demand while acknowledging the risk of holding costs (which are equal to profit), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to target ~50 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 0. This approach ensures enough stock for the current peak without over-ordering as the season matures.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime stabilized: Demand for P26-P29 averaged 49.0 units/week following the summer trough (avg ~15), confirming the transition to peak knitwear season.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Kai jumper' (580770001) has entered a high-velocity phase corresponding to the onset of the autumn/winter retail season. Period 30 saw a massive demand spike to 126 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 4-week average of ~49 units. This jump aligns with early September, when interest in knitwear typically surges. Despite ordering 47 units last period, we completely stocked out (sold 49 units, including 2 from existing stock), leaving no on-hand inventory. The latent demand is likely well above 100 units given the P30 result. To capture this growth and avoid further severe stockouts during this peak season, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (P26-P30) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=5 captures the jump from low summer demand to the current spike. Given the extreme outlier in P30 (126), the mean of the last 5 periods (mean=64.4) is more aggressive than the default but still conservative compared to the most recent observation; however, the backend's base-stock logic will use the standard deviation to cover the upside risk. Lead time L=0 is historically consistent.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Significant demand outlier (126 units) in Period 30 confirms the 'Kai jumper' has moved into a high-peak autumn/winter regime, far exceeding the late-August transition average of ~50 units/week.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The 'Kai jumper' has definitively entered its peak autumn/winter demand regime. Period 30 saw 126 units and Period 31 saw 129 units, both ending in total stockouts. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Based on these last two observations, demand has more than doubled from the late-August transition average (~50). To avoid further lost sales during this peak, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 135 units (slightly above the last two weeks of constrained demand to account for potential lost demand). I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 35 to handle the high volatility seen in such sharp seasonal ramps. Lead time remains stable at 0. These parameters will signal the OR backend to place a larger order to recover from the current stockout and meet the sustained high demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Peak Autumn/Winter regime confirmed. Demand in P30 (126) and P31 (129) shows a 160% increase over the late-August average (~49). Recurring stockouts continue to mask the full extent of latent demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

The product (Kai jumper) is firmly in the peak Autumn/Winter demand regime. While demand in Period 32 (80 units) was lower than the extreme spikes in Periods 30 and 31 (126 and 129 respectively), it remains significantly elevated compared to the late-August transition (approx. 50 units/week). Period 32 was the first period in four weeks where stock was sufficient to meet demand, revealing a realized demand of 80. To provide a robust buffer for the high volatility and potential latent demand seen in the preceding weeks, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current peak (avg ~111 units/week). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high-volume environment while allowing the backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock (sigma_hat) based on the recent high variance.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '580770001' (Kai jumper) is in its peak autumn/winter demand regime. Demand in the most recent periods (P30-P33) has been 126, 129, 80, and 118, resulting in persistent stockouts despite higher order quantities. The current date is late September, aligning with peak seasonal demand for knitwear. The average demand over the last four periods is approximately 113 units/week. Since the product has been frequently stock-constrained, this average likely underrepresents true demand. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 130 to account for these stockouts and the high-demand regime, ensuring our base stock level covers this higher expected volume. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to accommodate the high volatility observed (ranging from 80 to 129 in the peak). Lead time L is set to default (0) as all orders have consistently arrived within the same period.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Peak autumn demand confirmed at ~113-130 units/week. Stockouts in 6 of the last 8 periods (P26-P33) indicate that observed sales are inventory-constrained and actual demand is likely \u2265125 units/week.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019, which is peak knitwear season. While Period 34 showed a demand dip to 46 units, this is likely a high-variance outlier in a peak regime, as evidenced by the high demand in preceding periods (P30: 126, P31: 129, P33: 118). The Carry-over insights confirm that latent demand for this item is consistently \u2265125 units/week in this season. The 'sold' units in Period 34 (46) were significantly lower than the starting inventory (130), meaning we finally avoided a stockout, but applying a forecast based on this single low data point would risk future stockouts. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 125 to reflect the established peak seasonality mean, while using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility (std) observed over the last 5 periods (P30-P34). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The 'Kai jumper' is currently in its peak autumn/winter demand phase. However, observed demand over the last two periods (P34: 46 units, P35: 48 units) shows a significant cooling compared to the high-peak volatility seen in P30-P33 (average ~113 units). This suggest we have moved past an initial autumn spike into a more stable but relatively high-demand plateau. The 'recent_N' approach with N=6 (covering P30-P35) provides a balanced mean of ~83 units/week, which accounts for both the peak spikes and the recent moderation. Given that the promised lead time of 0 periods has remained perfectly consistent, L is set to default. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 77 units, and the OR backend's inventory-capped logic will ensure we order enough to maintain this transition level without overstocking during this slightly lower demand cluster.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau detected following autumn peak: Demand has moderated from a P30-P33 average of ~113 units to a P34-P35 average of ~47 units, though it remain significantly above summer levels (~15 units).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The 'Kai jumper' is currently in Period 37 (Oct 21). Demand analysis shows a significant cooling from the late September peak of ~120 units to a more moderate level. Over the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has been 46, 48, and 18, averaging ~37 units/week. This suggests the initial peak was likely driven by early-season purchasing and demand has now stabilized at a lower level for mid-autumn. I am setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to capture this rapid decline from the peak and prevent over-stocking. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory of 74 units is sufficient to cover nearly two weeks of this current demand level, so the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order this period to optimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Sustained reduction in demand from peak levels (~120 units/week) to a mid-autumn average of 37.3 units/week (P34-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The 'Kai jumper' is currently in a post-peak autumn phase (Date: 2019/10/28). We observed a significant demand regime shift at Period 34, where demand dropped from the peak levels (~113-130 units/week) to a much lower stabilization level. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has been 46, 48, 18, and 26 units, averaging 34.5 units per week. The latest two periods (18 and 26) suggest a further cooling as we head into late October, though we must remain cautious about potential winter holiday spikes. On-hand inventory is currently 48 units with 0 in-transit. Given the service/holding cost balance (Profit=1, Holding=1), the OR engine aims for a 50% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new lower-demand regime (P34-P37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the 'default' lead time of 0 as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization in mid-to-late autumn: Following the September peak, demand (P34-P37) has settled into a lower regime averaging ~35 units/week, a ~70% decrease from peak levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the mid-to-late autumn season for this knitwear SKU (Kai jumper). Following the major peak in September (P30-P31), demand has stabilized into a lower regime. Over the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38), demand has been 46, 48, 18, 26, and 42 units respectively, resulting in an average of 36 units/week. This aligns with the carry-over insight from P38 noting a stabilization around 35 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently very low (6 units) as previous orders were zeroed out to bleed off excess stock from the peak. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stable post-peak autumn regime while avoiding the extreme skew of the September surge. Sigma_hat will also be based on these 5 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product (Kai jumper) is in a mid-to-late autumn stabilization regime after its September peak. Recent demand (P34-P39) has averaged 32.8 units/week, significantly lower than the ~120 units seen during the peak, but showing more stability than the early summer trough. The last three periods (P37-P39) had demands of 26, 42, and 17, confirming a regime around 30-35 units/week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory levels (On-hand: 19) are currently low relative to this demand regime. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization (P34-P39), which gives the backend a stable look at current demand volatility and mean while avoiding the massive outliers from September.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-September peak: From Period 34 to 39, demand for the Kai jumper has averaged 32.8 units/week, a ~70% reduction from the peak period (P30-P33 avg ~113).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical data for this 'Kai jumper' shows a high-peak autumn regime in September (P30-P33) where demand exceeded 100 units/week, followed by a significant moderation starting in Period 34. For the last 7 periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged 30.1 units/week, with the most recent three periods (P38-P40) showing 42, 17, and 14 units respectively. While there was a slight uptick in P38, the overall trend is consistent with a stable mid-late autumn regime. Demand is lower than the September peak but remains significantly above the summer trough (~15 units). Based on this stabilization, I am setting N=7 to capture the demand mean and variance since the post-peak drop. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The base stock will target this stabilized 30-unit mean to prevent overstocking as we approach the end of the calendar year.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-September peak confirmed: Following the P30-P33 peak (avg ~113), demand from P34-P40 has stabilized at a mean of 30.1 units/week.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The 'Kai jumper' is currently in a stabilized post-peak autumn regime. Demand from Period 34 to 41 has averaged 30.1 units/week, a significant reduction from the September peak of ~113-125 units but substantially higher than the summer trough of ~15 units. The last three periods (P39-P41) show even lower demand (17, 14, 12), averaging 14.3 units, which may indicate a further seasonal dip as we approach late November. However, given the product is a knitwear item (soft, rib-knit cotton blend), it remains relevant for winter. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 8 to capture the stable post-peak average (~30 units/week), which prevents over-reacting to the very low demand in the last three weeks while acknowledging the end of the high-demand season. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43), entering the core winter season for the 'Kai jumper'. While the carry-over insights indicate a stabilization around 30 units/week following the Autumn peak, the most recent demand in Period 42 was an exceptionally low outlier (3 units). However, looking at the recent regime (P34-P42), demand has generally averaged around 27 units/week. Given the product is a knitwear item (cotton-blend jumper), we must remain prepared for sustained cold-weather demand in December despite the recent single-week dip. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=9, covering the post-peak era from P34 onwards) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which balances the recent stabilization while smoothing out the P42 outlier. This ensures we don't overreact to one week of low demand at the start of winter.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. We are in the late autumn/early winter period for the 'Kai jumper'. Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift following the September peak. From Period 34 to Period 43, demand has stabilized at a much lower level, averaging 26.1 units/week. More recently (P39-P43), demand has declined further to an average of approximately 10.2 units/week, with the most recent sample at 5 units. This suggests we are entering a holiday/winter trough or that the season for this specific item is winding down. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable as all recent orders have arrived within the same period. I am setting L to 'default' (0), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing the most recent stable-but-low demand phase to avoid overstocking), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current lower volatility. This conservative setting balances the low holding cost against the current low demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Winter season decline confirmed. Demand from Period 39 to 43 has dropped to an average of ~10 units/week, a ~66% reduction from the post-peak stabilization average of ~30 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is the 'Kai jumper', a knitwear item currently in mid-December (Period 45), which is the deep winter season. Based on recent demand history (Periods 42-44), demand has plummeted to very low single digits (3, 5, and 4 units respectively) despite being in winter, suggesting the product may be entering a clearance or end-of-lifecycle phase, or there is a significant late-season drop in interest for this specific style. The current on-hand inventory is 17 units, which already covers more than 4 weeks of recent average demand (approx. 4 units/week). With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47) and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1 (leading to a 50% service level target), the objective is to minimize holding costs while avoiding significant stockouts. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the low-demand regime from Period 39 onwards, allowing the OR backend to determine if additional units are needed based on the existing 17 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Late winter demand collapse confirmed. Demand for P42-P44 averaged 4.0 units/week, a 60% reduction from the P39-P41 average of 14.3 units/week, indicating the product is likely at end-of-season clearance levels.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product '580770001' (Kai jumper) has entered a definitive end-of-season decline as of Period 46 (Dec 23). Historical demand samples from Period 42 to 45 (3, 5, 4, 2) show a very low average of 3.5 units/week. With only 2 periods remaining in the simulation (46 and 47), and an current on-hand inventory of 15 units, we already have over 4 weeks of supply relative to the current demand regime. Since holding costs ($1.0) equal potential profit ($1.0), and the lead time is 0, there is no benefit to ordering more stock. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this late-winter trough, which will result in the OR backend calculating a base stock lower than our current on-hand levels, correctly generating a zero order to minimize holding costs as the simulation concludes.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product (Kai jumper) is at the absolute end of its winter seasonal cycle. Demand has collapsed from a post-peak average of ~30 units (P34-P41) to a clearance-level average of 3.0 units over the last 5 periods (P42-P46: 3, 5, 4, 2, 1). With 14 units currently on hand and demand trending toward zero as we enter January, the priority is to avoid holding costs on dead stock. Promised lead time remains 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this terminal demand regime, which will likely result in a zero order as on-hand inventory (14) significantly exceeds the expected demand for the next period.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Terminal demand regime confirmed for late December. Demand for P42-P46 averaged 3.0 units/week, down from 30+ units in mid-autumn, as the product reaches end-of-life/clearance status.
