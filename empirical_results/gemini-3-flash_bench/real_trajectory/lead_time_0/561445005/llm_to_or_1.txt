Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 561445005, a women's basic jersey T-shirt. There is no existing inventory (on-hand: 0). The product description suggests a high-volume everyday staple. Looking at the initial demand history (113, 141, 104, 173, 134), the mean demand across the last 5 weeks is approximately 133 units with a standard deviation around 26. Since the promised lead time is 0 and we are just starting, I will use a conservative approach. However, given the 'Jersey Basic' nature, demand is likely stable but possibly trending slightly upward as spring approaches. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the recent baseline accurately. For L, I will use 'default' (0) as per the promised lead time until history suggests otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's fitted jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics). Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) was: 113, 141, 104, 173, 134 (mean \u2248 133). In Period 1, external demand was 156, which is slightly higher than the recent average but aligns with the volatility. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0 (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out the 133 units that arrived last period (leaving 23 units of unmet demand). My goal is to set parameters that cover the demand for the current period and the next (since lead time is 0, we order for immediate arrival, but the OR backend uses L+1 logic). I will use recent history (N=6, including P1 demand) to estimate mu and sigma. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend of approximately 137 per period, which the OR engine will multiply by (1+L).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a Women's Jersey T-shirt. Historical samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 139 units. However, in Period 1 and 2, observed demand was 156 and 207 units respectively, indicating a significant upward shift. Period 2 demand (207) is especially high, possibly due to seasonal transition into spring. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have lost sales because demand exceeded order quantities (since the system uses a base-stock policy capped by previous averages). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To capture the recent demand surge and prevent further stockouts, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=2 to focus on the immediately preceding weeks (156, 207), which better reflect the current trend than the January data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting mid-February: Demand increased from an average of 139 (Jan-early Feb) to 181.5 (last 2 weeks), representing a ~30% increase.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's jersey T-shirt, a classic staple that should see consistent demand, potentially increasing as spring approaches (March). Reviewing the history: Period 1 (156), Period 2 (207), and Period 3 (179) show a significantly higher mean (avg 180.7) compared to the initial pre-game samples (avg 133). The Carry-Over Insight correctly identified a regime shift around Period 3. On-hand inventory is currently very low (3 units) because demand has consistently matched or exceeded supply. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 4, I will set L=0. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the higher demand regime observed in the game history (avg ~181). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to meet the current higher demand level and rebuild safety stock.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Short-sleeved T-shirt'. Demand has shifted from a January/early Feb average of ~139 to a significantly higher average of ~182 over the last three weeks (P2-P4), likely due to seasonal transition into spring. Historical arrivals (P1-P4) confirm that although the promised lead time is 0, the actual lead time is indeed 0 (same-period arrival). However, in periods 1, 2, and 4, we experienced stockouts because the demand exceeded the inventory provided by the OR backend's capped policy. Specifically, P2 had demand of 207 and P4 had demand of 187. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime (~182) and use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to better reflect the increased volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 13.5). This will push the base stock higher to minimize lost sales in this high-demand period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical data from Period 1 to Period 5 shows an average demand of approximately 177.6 units, following a shift detected around Period 3. The last three periods (P3-P5) had demands of 179, 187, and 159, averaging 175. The lead time (L) is consistently observed as 0 periods (order arrives same period). On-hand inventory is currently low (32 units). Since Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand for base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the modern demand regime while smoothing out the slight dip in the most recent period. Although it is mid-March, there is no strong evidence of a major seasonal spike yet, so I will rely on the recent historical mean and volatility to maintain sufficient stock levels.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, and we are managing a women's basic jersey t-shirt. Reviewing arrival history, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 6 completed periods. The demand regime shift noted in Period 3 has stabilized. Calculating demand from the last 4 periods (Periods 3-6: 179, 187, 159, 169) gives a mean of 173.5, which is consistent with the 'Carry-over Insight' of ~181.5 but reflects a slight normalization. Given Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio (q) is 0.5, which corresponds to a z-score of 0. The OR backend will aim for a base_stock equal to the expected demand (mu_hat). With L=0, the formula is base_stock = mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 175 using the 'recent_N' method (N=4) to capture the current stable demand level while ignoring the lower initial January/early February data. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized in the 160-180 range since late February; the initial surge has transitioned into a consistent plateau.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Historical data (Periods 1-7) consistently shows an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand shifted upward in late February and has since stabilized. The average demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 3-7) is 171.6, with relatively low volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 10 units with 0 in-transit. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should align closely with the median/mean demand. Since the lead time is 0, we need to cover demand for the current period (L+1 = 1). I will use the recent 5 samples (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stabilized regime while filtering out the initial transition noise.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. We are looking at a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Historical data from early January to early February showed a base demand of ~133-141 units. Since mid-February (Period 1), demand shifted upward and has remained remarkably stable. Over the last 8 periods, demand has averaged 174.6 units (min 156, max 207), and over the last 5 periods (Period 4 to Period 8), it has averaged 170.8. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently holding true across all observed periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0) naturally, but the capping mechanism ensures a base safety buffer. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the stabilized demand plateau identified in the carry-over insights and encompasses the most recent April demand level.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. After a higher demand regime in March (averaging ~170-180), Period 9 saw a significant drop to 114 units. This might indicate the end of the early spring surge or a temporary fluctuation. However, given that this is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' and we are moving into warmer months, a complete collapse in demand is unlikely. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which means orders arrive the same period they are placed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to weigh the most recent month's behavior (Periods 6-9), which averages 155.5 units. This provides a balance between the previous high plateau and the recent dip. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand of the review+lead period (which is 1+0=1 period).

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand dropped significantly to 114 units from a previous 8-period average of ~170, suggesting a possible shift out of the early spring peak or a high-variance period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt'. Analyzing recent performance: Period 10 saw a significant demand spike to 219 units, the highest in history, which followed a low of 114 in Period 9. This high volatility suggests we are moving out of the steady plateau identified in Period 7 and into a more erratic phase, possibly driven by late April/early May seasonality (spring transition). Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to weight the recent variance (114, 219) and the previous regime (171) more heavily than the Jan/Feb data. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility seen in the last two periods. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying the OR backend targets a 50% service level; however, the order cap logic helps prevent over-ordering during high-variance transitions.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly as of Period 9-10 (range 114-219), ending the stable plateau (160-180) observed in March.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Recent demand history shows a significant upward shift and high volatility: Period 9 (114), Period 10 (219), and Period 11 (267). This suggests a late spring/early summer surge, likely driven by warmer weather and seasonal fashion cycles. The average demand over the last three periods is 200 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 'stable' plateau of 170. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this recent surge and address the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3. This focuses the backend's base stock calculation on the most recent regime of high growth and high variance, ensuring we stock enough to meet the rising demand while accounting for the recent instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Demand has moved from a stable 170 average to a higher-growth phase (latest demand 267), with the 3-period average rising to 200.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early May (2019/5/06). The product is a women's t-shirt, an 'Everyday Basic' that is highly relevant for late spring and summer. Historical demand has shown high volatility recently with a significant spike to 267 and then a drop to 198. The 3-period average (Periods 10-12) is 228 (219, 267, 198), while the 5-period average (Periods 8-12) is 195. Given the seasonal relevance of short-sleeved jersey tops peaking in May-June, I expect demand to remain strong or grow. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand momentum (avg ~220) while avoiding over-indexing on the single 267 peak. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility observed since mid-April.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-demand, high-volatility regime for May (Avg ~220, Range 198-267) compared to the March/April plateau (~170).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '561445005' is a short-sleeved women's t-shirt, entering mid-May which typically sees sustained demand for basics as weather warms. Reviewing recent demand (Periods 11-13: 267, 198, 197), there's a clear upward shift from the previous spring plateau (~170) to a May average of ~220. Although the last two periods were slightly lower than Period 11's peak, they remain significantly higher than the earlier spring months. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). To avoid stockouts in this high-demand, high-volatility regime, I will use recent history (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current May average (~220 units per period) and a wider window (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the recent spike (267) and ensure a robust safety stock, given that holding and stockout costs are equal ($1/unit).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Demand has significantly increased in May compared to March/April, with recent demand points being 267, 198, 197, and 222 (avg ~221). This align with seasonal trends for 'Everyday Basics' as spring transitions into summer. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by 14 consecutive periods of same-period arrival. My strategy is to capture this new, higher demand regime while accounting for the high volatility observed since late April. I will use recent_N=4 to focus specifically on the May demand levels (starting from the spike in Period 11) for mu_hat, and recent_N=6 to capture the increased variance seen since the end of the stable plateau in Period 9. Setting L to calculate ensures the backend stays responsive to the consistently observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime confirmed: Average demand has shifted to ~221 units (May 1st to May 20th), representing a sustained increase from the ~170 plateau seen in March/April.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's T-shirt) is in a high-demand regime for the month of May. Demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 11-15) has averaged 216.4 units (267, 198, 197, 222, 198). This is a significant increase from the March/April plateau of ~170. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (23 on-hand, 0 in-transit) after satisfying Period 15 demand. For Period 16 (late May), I will use the recent 5-period window to capture this sustained higher demand level while accounting for the recent volatility (range 197-267). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected 200+ demand units while maintaining a service level appropriate for a product with equal profit and holding costs.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 is a T-shirt ('Womens Everyday Basics'), which is entering its peak summer season in June. Demand historical data shows a clear shift: early spring (March/April) averaged ~170 units, while May has established a higher regime averaging ~221 units (based on periods 12-16: 198, 197, 222, 198, 225). Most recently, period 16 saw a demand of 225, confirming the high-demand state. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. To capture the current summer demand level, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the May regime) and a similar recent_N approach for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few weeks. This strategy ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 220+ target while the OR backend manages the tradeoff between the $1 profit and $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Demand has sustained a higher regime throughout May and entering June, averaging ~220 units compared to the previous ~170 spring plateau.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Short-sleeved T-shirt', which is entering the peak summer season (current date June 10th). Historically, demand shifted from a ~170 plateau in March/April to a ~220 regime in May. Although Period 17 saw a dip to 154, leading to 54 units on-hand, the overall summer peak remains the primary driver. Given the high volatility observed in April/May (range 198-267) and the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level), I will set the demand parameters to reflect the recent high-demand regime rather than reacting too strongly to a single-period dip. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (covering the shift from Period 11 onwards) to capture the higher mean and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. Lead time is consistently 0.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt showed a strong summer peak throughout May and early June, averaging approximately 220 units. However, the last two periods (Period 17 and 18) have seen a consecutive drop in demand to 154 and 146 units respectively. This suggests the summer peak may be subsiding or stabilizing at a lower level as we move further into June. Despite the 'Summer peak confirmed' carry-over insight from Period 17, the most recent data indicates a downward trend. I will shift to a more reactive forecasting method using the last 4 periods to capture this recent deceleration while still accounting for some of the higher May demand. This balances the risk of stockouts if the drop is temporary with the risk of high holding costs if the downtrend continues. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand deceleration in mid-June: Period 17-18 demand dropped to an average of 150 units from a May average of 220.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '561445005' is a women's basic jersey t-shirt. Reviewing historical demand, we transitioned from a high-demand May/early-June regime (avg ~220) into a lower demand phase starting in late June (2019/6/3 - 2019/6/17), with demand figures of 154, 146, and 157. This suggests a stabilization or deceleration into a summer baseline. The last three periods show a consistent mean of 152.3 units. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), as confirmed by the conclude messages for P1 through P19. With a current on-hand inventory of 24 units, and the backend logic for base stock (z* = 0 where profit=holding_cost), I will target the recent mean to avoid overstocking while demand is cooling. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this specific shift from the May peak to the June deceleration.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed for mid-to-late June: 3-period average dropped to ~152 units from May's peak of ~220 units (-31% shift).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Analysis of the recent demand history confirms a significant shift from the May/early-June peak (average ~220) to a lower, mid-summer regime. The last four periods (Periods 17-20) recorded demands of 154, 146, 157, and 155, showing remarkably high stability around a new mean of approximately 153 units. This deceleration was previously identified in carry-over insights and is now fully established over a 4-week window. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of this new regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to accurately capture the 153-unit mean, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the significantly reduced volatility (standard deviation ~5) compared to the preceding high-growth phase. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the OR backend will target a 50% service level (the median), which is appropriate for a stable regime to avoid overstocking as we enter the height of summer.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand stabilization at 153 units (Periods 17-20) following June deceleration; volatility has dropped significantly (std dev ~5) compared to the May regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical data and Carry-over Insights confirm a significant demand deceleration starting in mid-June. Demand dropped from a May average of ~220 units to a stable plateau in the 140-160 range over the last five periods (Periods 17-21: 154, 146, 157, 155, 140). The average demand over these 5 periods is 150.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 6.5, indicating very low volatility compared to previous months. The product is a women's fitted jersey T-shirt (everyday basic), which typically sees stable or slightly decreasing demand after the initial summer peak. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels in this lower-demand regime, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current 150-unit baseline and a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for the 'Everyday Basics' T-shirt has notably dropped in the most recent period (Period 22) to 94 units, significantly lower than the ~150 unit stabilization level observed from mid-June to early July (Periods 17-21). This suggests a potential new downward shift or end-of-season deceleration for this summer-related basic as July progresses. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Because of the recent drop in demand and the shift from the previous 150-unit plateau to 94, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this downward trend without overreacting to a single data point, while adjusting sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in this transition period. The profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1 implies a target service level of 50%, so the OR engine will naturally aim for the median demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand stabilization at 150 units (Periods 17-21) has ended; P22 demand dropped to 94 units, indicating a potential mid-summer deceleration.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's T-shirt) is exhibiting a clear seasonal deceleration as we move deeper into July. After a stable period around 150 units per week in June, demand has dropped to 94 (P22) and 105 (P23), confirming a transition to a lower demand regime. This aligns with mid-summer retail patterns for basic jersey tops. The average demand for the last two periods is ~100. Based on the documented 'lead_time was 0 periods' consistently in the 'conclude' messages, I will maintain L=0. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent two-period average (approx 100) to avoid carrying excessive inventory into this lower-demand phase, while using recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture the shift in volatility from the previous stabilization at 150 units to the current levels.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand deceleration confirmed: Demand dropped from a 150-unit June average to a ~100-unit average in mid-July (Periods 22-23), a 33% reduction.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's Summer T-shirt) has entered a mid-summer deceleration phase as expected for late July (Period 25). Demand over the last three periods has stabilized at a lower level (94, 105, 111), averaging approximately 103 units. This is a significant drop from the June average of ~150 and the May peak of ~220. Given the objective to balance a 50% service level (Profit $1/Holding $1) and the high stockout risk seen in Period 24 (sold 100 vs demand 111), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new, lower-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a mid-summer deceleration phase. Following a June average of ~150 units, demand in July (Periods 22-25) has settled into a new lower regime with an average of approximately 99 units (94, 105, 111, 86). The most recent demand (Period 25) was 86, the lowest in this regime, suggesting volatility or a continued slight downward trend as we move into August. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this mid-summer stabilization at ~100 units. I will also use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the decreased volatility of this new regime compared to the high-variance May/early June periods, ensuring the OR backend can optimize for lower holding costs without sacrificing necessary service levels during this slower season.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime for jersey basics has stabilized at approximately 100 units per week throughout July (Avg of Periods 22-25 is 99 units).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product is a Women's Jersey T-shirt, which has moved into a late-summer lower-demand regime. Demand in the most recent five periods (P22-P26) has been 94, 105, 111, 86, and 70, averaging approximately 93 units. The last two periods show a downward trend (86 and 70), indicating the end-of-season decline is accelerating. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the declining trend and the recent mean of ~93, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the July-August regime. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current reduced volatility (std dev of P22-P26 is ~16). Inventory is currently 29 units on-hand, and with lead_time=0, an order placed now will cover this period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand decline confirmed in August: Demand has dropped and averaged 93 units over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), down from the ~100 unit average in July.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are observing a significant and sustained decline in demand for this SKU (Womens Jersey Basic T-shirt) as we head deeper into August. Demand over the last three periods has been 86, 70, and 58, showing a clear downward trend. The average demand over the last four periods (P24-P27) is approximately 81 units, but the most recent figure of 58 suggests the 'late-summer decline' mentioned in the carry-over insights is accelerating. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (which equal profit for this item), I am using a recent_N of 4 to capture this lower demand regime while remaining slightly responsive to the most recent low data point. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all historical observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline accelerated in mid-August: 3-period average dropped to 71 units (P25-P27) from the July average of ~100 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a significant late-summer demand decline. The 3-period demand average for Periods 26-28 is approximately 75 units, significantly lower than the July average of ~100 units. Period 28 demand spiked slightly to 98, but it follows a clear downward trend (70, 58, then 98). The inventory is currently at 0 on-hand with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making the base stock target equal to the mean demand. I will use a recent_N of 4 periods (P25-P28) to capture the current lower demand regime (average of 86, 70, 58, 98 is 78). This approach balances the risk of overstocking during a seasonal decline against the need to meet the remaining baseline demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand for this short-sleeved jersey top (Womens Everyday Basics) has been on a sustained downward trend as summer ends. The 3-period average (P27-P29) is 73 units, and the 5nd-period average (P25-P29) is 75 units. This is a significant decrease from the July average of ~100 units. Given the transition into September, a further decline or at least a lower stabilization point is expected as seasonal demand for light t-shirts typically wanes in the fall. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this latest 'late summer/early fall decline' regime, which reflects the current average of approximately 75 units. This prevents over-ordering based on older, higher-demand periods while maintaining enough stock for the current localized demand level. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to 'Late Summer/Early Fall': Demand has averaged 75 units over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), confirming a sustained drop from the mid-summer average of 100 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a 'Late Summer/Early Fall' demand regime. Demand has significantly decreased from its summer peak (~220 units in May) and even its July plateau (~100 units). Over the last six periods (P25-P30), demand has averaged approximately 71 units (86, 70, 58, 98, 63, 51), with the three most recent periods (P28-P30) averaging 70.7 units. The most recent demand (P30) was 51, continuing a generally downward trend as we enter September. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs in this declining phase, I am selecting N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime shift precisely while maintaining some buffer for volatility (like the P28 spike). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to 'Early Fall' deceleration confirmed: Demand has averaged ~71 units over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), reaching a new low of 51 units in P30.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues to show a strong downward trend as we move into September (Early Fall). The latest demand data from Period 31 shows a significant drop to 38 units, reinforcing the 'Early Fall' deceleration noted in carry-over insights. Over the last three periods (P29-P31), demand has averaged 50.6 units, while the five-period average is 61.6. Given this sustained decline, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use recent_N=3 to capture the most current, lower demand level. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 periods will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that reflects the current low-demand environment, minimizing holding costs while still maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to 'Late Fall' deceleration: 3-period average (P29-P31) has dropped to 51 units from the previous 'Early Fall' average of 71 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Womens Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a sustained late-fall deceleration phase. Demand has dropped consistently from ~100 units in July to a 3-period average of 39 units (P30-P32). Specifically, the last three periods recorded demands of 51, 38, and 28, indicating a rapid downward trend as we move further into September. Current on-hand inventory is 23 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set the base stock to cover the current period's expected demand. Using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat captures this latest deceleration (average ~39), which, combined with the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level), should target a base stock near this value. The on-hand inventory of 23 will be subtracted, resulting in a small replenishment order to align with the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration continues into late September: 3-period average (P30-P32) has fallen to 39 units, down from the early-September average of 51 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues its seasonal late-fall decline as we enter late September. The 3-period average (P31-P33) has dropped to approximately 40 units (38, 28, 53), although P33 showed a slight unexpected bump. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory currently sits at 0 on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the clear downward trend since July (100 -> 75 -> 51 -> 40), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most current demand level (~40 units) while accounting for the high volatility seen in P33. This avoids overreacting to the single P33 spike while respecting the broader seasonal deceleration.

Carry-over insight: Late September demand stabilization: Despite a spike in P33 (53 units), the 3-period average remains low at 40 units, confirming the 'Late Fall' low-demand regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7th, 2019. The product is a 'Women's Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt. Historically, this product entered a low-demand 'Late Fall' regime starting in September (Period 30 onwards). Demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) has been 51, 38, 28, 53, and 41, with an average of 42.2 units. While there was a slight uptick to 53 in P33, the overall trend is stabilized at a significantly lower level than the summer peaks. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this low-demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer for the volatility seen in P33 (stale 3-period average is approx 40), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent late-September/early-October behavior. This helps the OR backend set a lower base stock that avoids overstocking and high holding costs during the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for 'Late Fall' (October) is confirmed stable around 40-42 units per week based on the last 5 periods (P30-P34), down from the ~70 units seen in early September.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. The product is a jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basic), which has shown a clear seasonal decline from a summer peak (~220 units) to a mid-summer plateau (~100 units), and finally to a 'Late Fall' low-demand regime. For October (Periods 30-35), demand has been consistently low, with observations of 51, 38, 28, 53, 41, and most recently 24. The 5-period average (P31-P35) is approximately 37 units. The last observation (24) suggests a potential further dip, but we must balance against the P33 spike (53). I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the October regime (Avg ~39). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The parameters aim to maintain enough stock for this low-demand phase without overstocking as we approach the end of the game (P47).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for 'Late Fall' (October) is confirming a lower stabilization point; the average for the first half of October (P34-P35) is ~33 units, following a September average of ~43 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is exhibiting a clear seasonal decline typical for October in a 'Late Fall' regime. Recent demand values are: P32: 28, P33: 53, P34: 41, P35: 24, P36: 43. This averages approximately 38 units over the last 5 periods. The most recent demand (P36) was 43, while P35 was 24, showing moderate volatility within a low-demand band. Based on the 'Late Fall' stabilization identified in Carry-over insights, I will set N=7 for mu_hat to capture the regime starting around P30 (avg ~37.5), and N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the current variability. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a late-autumn low-demand phase. Demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the summer peak. The last four periods (P34-P37) shows demand of 41, 24, 43, 25, which averages 33.25 units. The 5-period average (P33-P37) is slightly higher at 37.2 due to a spike in P33. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the service level targets the median demand (0.50 quantile). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this current late-October stabilization (~37 units) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility (range ~24 to 43).

Carry-over insight: Late-October demand regime (P34-P37) has stabilized at an average of ~33 units, following the September average of ~43 units, marking the seasonal low for this SKU.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is a jersey basic t-shirt, which has seen a steady seasonal decline from a May peak (~220 units) to a late-October low (~33 units). Recent demand (P34-P38) has been 41, 24, 43, 25, 32, with an average of 33. This confirms the previously identified 'Late-October demand regime' stabilization. As we are now in early November, there is no evidence yet of a pre-holiday spike for this specific 'Everyday Basic' item, so I will continue to forecast based on the most recent 5-period regime (N=5). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) will target the current stabilized demand of ~33 units per period, balancing the high service level (since Profit=Holding) with minimal risk of overstocking during this low-demand phase.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, representing the late-fall/pre-winter season. Demand for this SKU (jersey basic t-shirt) has consistently decelerated through October, reaching a new seasonal low as indicated by P39's demand of 9 units. This follows a fairly stable regime in Oct (Avg ~33). The recent 3-period average (P37-P39) is 22 units, and the most recent observation is significantly lower. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are identical, the OR solver targets a 50% service level. However, to avoid overstocking during this clear downward trend, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the latest demand levels (approx. 22 units). Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to reflect the current low volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Late-fall demand deceleration accelerated in early November: P39 demand dropped to 9 units, bringing the 3-period average down to ~22 units from the October average of ~33 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a late-fall/early-winter low-demand period for this SKU (Womens Everyday Jersey T-shirt). Demand has significantly decelerated in November, with the last two periods showing demand of 9 and 12 units respectively. The carry-over insights confirm this sharp drop from the October average of ~33 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. With 12 units on-hand and an expected demand regime of ~10-15 units per week, the current inventory is nearly sufficient but needs a small replenishment to maintain a safe base stock level under the OR backend's logic. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent November deceleration accurately without being overly influenced by the higher October demand.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime shift confirmed: Demand has dropped to an average of ~10.5 units (P39-P40) from the October average of ~33 units, marking a -68% decrease and a new seasonal floor.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '561445005' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a deep seasonal trough as of late November. Period 41 demand was 17 units, following a very low start to November (9 and 12 units). The carry-over insights confirm a significant regime shift downward starting in Period 39. The average demand over the last three periods (P39-P41) is 12.67 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this low-demand phase and minimize holding costs which equal profit per unit, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of 3 periods to capture this new 'seasonal floor'. This ensures the base stock reflects the current low velocity (approx 13 units) rather than the higher historical averages from October or early autumn.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a late-year seasonal phase. We recently observed a significant demand spike in Period 42 (42 units), which broke the 'November floor' of ~11 units seen in Periods 39-40. This spike likely corresponds to late November/Black Friday shopping trends. History shows that actual lead time (L) consistently stays at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. To manage the current volatility and the potential start of a December/holiday lift, I am shifting from the very low November baseline (N=3) to a slightly longer lookback (recent_N = 5) to capture both the low floor and the recent spike. This will adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat upward to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 42, while maintaining the L=0 setting.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Late November demand spike detected (P42: 42 units), significantly exceeding the prior 3-period average of ~13 units, suggesting holiday-related volatility or a seasonal trend shift.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9). The product is a women's jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand was very high in May/June (~220 units) and has steadily declined through fall to a floor of ~11 units in November. However, a significant spike occurred in Period 42 (42 units, Nov 25), likely coinciding with Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Period 43 demand returned to a lower level (12 units). Given the December date, we should anticipate potential holiday-related volatility or a slight lift from the November floor. The 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat is set to 25 to account for a possible December baseline higher than November's average but lower than the Black Friday peak, ensuring we carry enough stock for modest holiday demand while minimizing holding costs for this low-margin ($1) item. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: December demand baseline appears slightly higher than November's seasonal low (12 vs 10.5 average), likely due to holiday seasonality, but significantly lower than the Black Friday spike (42 units).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for this basic jersey T-shirt is in its seasonal low, with a temporary spike during Black Friday (P42). Recent demand (P43-P44) has dropped back to 12 and 7 units respectively. The November/December baseline excluding the spike is roughly 10-12 units. Given the date is Dec 16th, we may see a small lift due to holiday gifting, but history suggests demand is generally low and stable at this time of year. I will use the last 6 periods (P39-P44) to capture the current low-demand regime while including the P42 spike to acknowledge potential volatility. This results in a N=6 average for mu_hat. Sigma_hat needs to account for the high variance introduced by the P42 spike (42 units vs ~10 units), so recent_N with N=6 is appropriate here as well to maintain a sufficient service level without overstocking. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: December demand baseline confirmed low (7-12 units) following the temporary Black Friday spike (42 units at P42).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. This is the peak of the Christmas holiday week. Historical data from December (P43-P45) shows a baseline demand of roughly 7-19 units, excluding the Black Friday spike (P42: 42 units). However, the most recent observation (P45) showed a significant jump to 19 units compared to P44's 7 units, indicating a late-December surge as customers likely fulfill last-minute basic needs. Given that the next period includes the post-Christmas and New Year's transition, I expect demand to remain higher than the 10-unit November floor but lower than the May/Summer peak. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (averaging ~12.6 units) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of the holiday season (ranging from 7 to 42 units). The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Late-December demand surge detected: P45 demand increased to 19 units from P44's 7 units, suggesting a minor holiday-related uptick for jersey basics.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the final week of the year. Historically, this SKU (Women's Jersey Basic) experienced a mid-December uptick (P45 demand: 19, P46 demand: 24), but typically enters a lower regime in early Q1 based on the initial samples from early 2019 (Jan-Feb began around ~113-140). The carry-over insights confirm we have exited the extreme November lows (avg ~10) and are currently in a minor holiday/end-of-year surge (~21 avg over last 2 periods). Since lead time remains stable at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current holiday lift while preparing for the post-holiday stabilization. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility seen in December (7 to 24 range).

Carry-over insight: End-of-December demand uptick confirmed: average demand for P45-P46 rose to 21.5 units from the early-December average of ~10 units.
