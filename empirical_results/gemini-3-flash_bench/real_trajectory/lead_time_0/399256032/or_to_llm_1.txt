The OR base-stock calculation is likely being dragged down by the early January low demand samples (51, 64). Given the recent demand average of 127 and the seasonal relevance of ankle-length jeans in late February, an order of 70 is insufficient and would likely lead to a stockout. \n5. **Final Strategy**: Target a stock level that covers the recent average plus a small buffer.

Historical data from January to early February showed a mean demand of approximately 87. Since mid-February (Periods 1-3), the demand has shifted significantly higher to an average of 110 (113, 124, 94). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Starting on-hand is 52. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 44 units based on a base-stock policy that assumes a 1-period look ahead (L+1). However, the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), making the critical fractile 0.5 (targeting the median demand). Since actual demand is trending higher than the all-time history, the OR recommendation of 44 is too low as it only targets a base stock of roughly 96 units (44 + 52). Given current demand levels (~110), this would lead to a stockout.

Recent demand (P7: 133, P8: 106) is significantly higher than the initial historical mean (87). The last 8 periods average ~103 units/period. Period 7 saw a stockout at 105 units, indicating true demand was likely higher. 4. OR Recommendation Analysis: The OR agent recommends 63 units based on historical data. This is too low because it doesn't account for the current spring surge or the 0-period lead time effectively given the stockouts in P6 and P7. 5. Strategy: I need to target an inventory level that covers the expected high demand for Period 9. With an average of ~103 and a recent peak of 133+, target inventory should be around 140 units. Current on-hand is 34, so an order of 106 units is needed. Adjusting slightly higher to 110 to buffer against another potential surge like P7.",

The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. For Period 29 (late August), demand is expected to remain consistent with the recent low-regime average rather than the historical spring peak. Recent weekly demands have been 30, 25, 34, and 38, averaging 31.75. The current on-hand inventory is 32 units, which is almost exactly one week's worth of demand. The OR recommendation is 37 units, which targets a total stock of ~69 units (32 on-hand + 37 order). This is slightly aggressive given the 0-day lead time and the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($1.00). If I order 37 units, I risk high holding costs if demand doesn't spike. However, the slightly rising trend (25 -> 34 -> 38) and the start of late August/early September (Back-to-School season) might signal a minor uptick.

We are currently in late October (2019/10/28), and the 'ankle-length' style is typically less desirable as weather turns colder. The OR recommendation of 11 units aims to bring the total inventory (on-hand 49 + order) to a level that covers the current low demand regime (~13 units) plus a small safety buffer. Given that on-hand inventory (49) already covers nearly 4 weeks of current demand, a minimal order is appropriate.

The OR recommendation suggests ordering 29 units to reach a base stock level. However, given that demand is low and stable at ~14 units, and the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), excess inventory is risky.

The OR recommendation of 39 units is based on a longer historical average and is too high for this low-demand regime, risking significant holding costs. I plan to set the order quantity to maintain roughly 1-2 weeks of stock. Since demand is around 11-15 units, and I have 18 on-hand, an order of 10-15 units would be safer.
