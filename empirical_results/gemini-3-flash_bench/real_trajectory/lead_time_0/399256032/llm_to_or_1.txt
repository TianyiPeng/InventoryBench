Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) managing SKU 399256032 (Womens Ankle-length jeans). Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 51, 64, 75, 99, 145 over the last 5 weeks. This suggests a transition from winter into early spring fashion demand. The last sample (145) is nearly triple the first sample, indicating a strong positive regime shift. Given the promised lead time (L) is 0, the order placed now will arrive this period (Period 1) and be available for this period's demand. To avoid stockouts during this growth phase, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the most recent acceleration (avg: 106.33), rather than the full history (avg: 86.8). This ensures our base stock level reflects the current demand trajectory. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the increased volatility seen in the higher-demand periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the order of 107 units arrived immediately (lead_time=0), but demand (113) exceeded supply, resulting in 0 ending inventory and 6 units of lost sales. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 51, 64, 75, 99, 145 (pre-game samples) followed by 113 in Period 1. This reflects early spring seasonality for 'Ankle-length jeans'. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this recent momentum and explicit L=0 based on the observed lead time, while maintaining a higher sigma_hat to account for the volatility in this growth phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $119.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256032' (Women's Skinny Ankle Jeans) is exhibiting a clear upward trend in demand as we move through February. Historical samples were: 51, 64, 75, 99, 145. Recent observed demand in Period 1 was 113 and Period 2 was 124. The average of the last 3 samples (145, 113, 124) is approximately 127.3. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this upward movement while smoothing fluctuations. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been confirmed by the arrival of orders in Period 1 and 2 within the same period (lead_time=0). However, because we have hit zero inventory at the end of both periods (lost sales), I need to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high. The OR backend will compute base_stock using profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), resulting in a service level target (q) of 0.5. To protect against the stockouts observed, I will stay with recent_N to reflect the current higher demand regime compared to the early January data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~70 (Jan) to ~120+ (Feb). Lead time confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 4 (2019-03-04). Current data shows a clear demand shift. January (pre-game) mean was ~72. February (Periods 1-3) mean jumped to 110.3 (113, 124, 94). Despite the lower demand in Period 3 (94), the category (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is entering the spring season, so I expect demand to remain higher than the January baseline. The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages for Periods 1, 2, and 3 confirm an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently at 34 units with 0 in-transit. Since both profit and holding cost are $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base_stock should target the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current February/March regime (mean ~110, std ~15) instead of the total history which includes the lower January figures.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-11. The product is women's skinny ankle jeans. Demand has transitioned from the initial January baseline (~76) to a significantly higher level starting in February. Looking at the last four periods of demand (113, 124, 94, 94), the average is approximately 106. Recent demand has stabilized around 94 for the last two weeks, suggesting a slight cooling from the mid-February peak of 124. The lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher February-March regime while smoothing out the volatility between the 120s and 90s. With profit and holding cost both being $1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)), meaning the OR backend will aim to set the base stock close to the mean demand during the protection interval (L+1 periods). Since L=0, the protection interval is 1 period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late Feb/early March around ~106 average (Period 1-4), up from ~70 in Jan. Lead time consistently 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18. Looking at the demand history for SKU 399256032 (Womens Ankle-length jeans), we saw a significant spike in early February (113, 124 units) followed by a stabilization in late February/early March (94, 94, 67 units). The most recent period (P5) saw a drop to 67 units, suggesting the intense early-Spring surge might be tapering off as we move further into March. The mean demand for the last three periods is approximately 85. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods across all concluded periods (orders arrive the same week they are placed). Given the drop to 67 units in P5, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this cooling trend (average ~85) rather than the historical mean from the high-February peak. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level for the base stock calculation, which I will support by using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (std dev of 94, 94, 67 is ~15.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering detected in March: average demand moved from ~100+ (Feb surge) to ~85 (last 3 periods), with a recent low of 67.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is entering late March. Historically, demand spiked in February (avg ~110+) but has settled to a more stable albeit fluctuating range in March (94, 94, 67, 95). The average of the last 4 periods is approximately 87.5. Lead time is consistently 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 6. I am setting L to explicit 0 to ensure immediate replenishment. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the stabilized March demand level (averaging ~87.5 per period, or ~175 for the review+lead window). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the moderate volatility seen in recent weeks (ranging from 67 to 95). This setup aims to maintain enough stock to meet demand without over-ordering as the initial spring surge levels off.

Carry-over insight: March demand regime stabilized: average demand for SKU 399256032 is 87.5 units/period (based on P3-P6), down from the Feb peak of ~120.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st. Analysis of history shows a clear demand spike in the most recent period (Period 7: 133 units), following a period of tapering in March (average was ~85). This jump suggests a transition from the early spring regime into a higher-volume spring/summer retail period for 'Ankle-length jeans'. Looking at the pre-game and game history (Feb: ~120, March: ~85, Period 7: 133), the demand is volatile but currently trending upwards. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (all orders arrive in the same period). Given Period 7's demand of 133 and Period 2's peak of 124, I will adjust forecast parameters to account for this recent strength. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture both the low March periods and the high Period 7 surge, balancing the estimate at approximately 97 units per period before the OR backend applies the safety stock logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 8: March average (~87) has been superseded by a spring surge (Period 7 demand: 133). Monitoring for sustained demand above 110 units/period.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. The SKU is 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans. Historical demand shows a significant increase in April (Period 7: 133, Period 8: 106) compared to the March average (~87). This aligns with spring seasonality for ankle-length denim. However, inventory has stocked out for the last three periods (P6, P7, P8) because the OR backend's order cap (based on simple historical moving averages) is underestimating the required base stock during this surge. The lead time remains consistently 0. To break the stockout cycle and capture the spring demand, I am using an 'explicit' L of 0 to match observations, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=3) to focus on the recent higher demand (95, 133, 106). I'm setting sigma_hat to 'explicit' at 25 to provide a wider safety buffer, as the underlying 0.95 quantile cap in the backend is currently too restrictive for this high-vulnerability stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge confirmed (April): Demand increased from a March average of ~87 to an April average of ~119.5 (+37%). Consistent stockouts (Periods 6-8) indicate the necessity for higher service level parameters (mu/sigma).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/15. We are seeing a spring demand regime for 'Skinny Ankle Jeans'. Demand in the last three periods has been 133, 106, and 81, averaging 106.7. This is significantly higher than the March average (~87). Although Period 9 demand dropped to 81, the overall trend since late March (Period 7) suggests a higher mean than the start of the year. The in-transit records and 'conclude' messages consistently show that the actual lead time is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the inventory frequently hits zero (Periods 6, 7, and 8), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture this recent spring surge and setting sigma_hat to explicit based on the observed volatility (approx 25) in this regime to prevent further stockouts. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the lead time plus one period of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans has entered a more volatile phase following the spring surge in late March/early April. Over the last four periods (Periods 7-10), demand has been 133, 106, 81, and 76. This shows a distinct tapering from the April 1st peak, stabilizing back toward a lower mean of approximately 99 units per period across these four weeks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5 (the median). To reflect the recent tapering while acknowledging the higher spring variance, I will use recent_N with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the post-surge behavior while maintaining enough history to capture the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand normalization: April demand tapered from a peak of 133 (P7) to ~78 (P9-10), indicating the spring peak has passed. Demand now resides in a moderate-volume, high-variance regime (~99 avg over P7-P10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' has entered a post-surge normalization phase. After a late March/early April peak (up to 133 units), demand over the last three periods has stabilized at lower levels (81, 76, 74). The mean demand for this most recent regime (P9-P11) is 77 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to reflect this lower, stable demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 samples to account for the reduced volatility in this specific regime. With profit and holding costs equal, the OR backend targets a 50% service level plus the safety stock included in the cap calculation, which is appropriate for this balanced cost structure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Market has normalized following the spring surge; average demand decreased from ~119 to ~77 (-35%) over the last three periods (P9-P11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and the product is 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans. Historical demand analysis shows three distinct regimes: a February peak (~110-120), a March/early April fluctuation (81-133), and a recent post-spring normalization (Periods 9-12) where demand has averaged ~79 units. Period 12 saw a stockout with demand (85) exceeding starting inventory (77), confirming that demand remains steady around the 80-85 range even after the April peak. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current normalized demand regime (P9-P12 avg: 79) and provide enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts, as lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Stocking out at 77 units suggests a slightly higher target is necessary to capture potential upside in the 80s.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. This product is an 'Ankle-length jeans in washed stretch denim,' which typically sees consistent demand in spring but may begin to fluctuate as summer approaches. Recent historical demand (P11-P13) shows a stabilized lower regime following the April surge: 74, 85, and 66 units, with an average of 75 units/period. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. The on-hand inventory is currently very low (13 units). I will set OR parameters to reflect this recent lower-volume regime to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for the moderate variance observed. I am choosing N=4 for mu_hat to capture the post-April trend (Periods 10-13: 76, 74, 85, 66), which averages approximately 75 units.

Carry-over insight: May demand stabilization: Demand has settled into a lower regime following the spring peak, averaging ~75 units/period over the last 3-4 weeks (P10-P13).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for SKU 399256032 (Womens Ankle Jeans) has clearly exited its spring surge phase (which peaked in late March/early April) and has stabilized into a lower, more consistent late-spring regime. Over the last four periods (P11-P14), demand has been 74, 85, 66, and 58 respectively, averaging 70.75 units per period. The most recent demand (58) continues this downward trend towards a stable baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level that captures this stabilized demand, I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4, focusing on the current demand window post-normalization.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Demand has continued to soften into late May, averaging ~71 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P11-P14), down from the early May stabilization level of ~75.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for SKU 399256032 (Womens Ankle Jeans) has continued to soften throughout May, with the last four periods showing demands of 85 (stocked out), 66, 58, and 65 (average ~68.5). This represents a clear downward shift from the April average (~99). Although we are entering early June, there is no immediate indication of a summer surge yet; the priority is to avoid overstocking and high holding costs since Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.00), suggesting a targeted service level of 50% (base_stock = mean). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=5 (last 5 actual demand samples) to capture the late-May demand regime (~69.6 average) while maintaining enough data to account for the volatility seen in early May.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Late May demand has settled into a lower volume regime averaging ~69 units/period (P12-P15), compared to the early May average of ~75. Normalization from the spring surge is complete.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical data for the 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans shows a clear seasonal peak in April (spring surge) followed by a normalization in May. Demand in the most recent periods (P13-P16) was 66, 58, 65, and 80, averaging 67.25 units. Although Period 16 saw a slight uptick to 80, the overall trend since May has been stable between 60-80 units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended Period 16 at 0 due to the slight demand spike exceeding starting stock. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the consolidated post-surge demand level of approximately 67 units/period. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current volatility (StdDev of [66, 58, 65, 80]). L remains at 'default' since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for item 399256032 (Womens Ankle Jeans) has stabilized after the spring peak. Over the last five periods (P13-P17), demand has averaged approximately 66.8 units (66, 58, 65, 80, 65), showing much lower volatility and lower volume compared to the Feb/April peaks. Although demand has softened slightly since early May, it remains relatively consistent around the high 60s. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-spring regime while accounting for the recent slight variance increase in P16.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for SKU 399256032 (Womens Ankle Jeans) has recently declined from the spring surge and settled into a lower-volume summer regime. Over the last three periods (P16-P18), demand has been 80, 65, and 51, averaging approximately 65 units/period. This follows a clear downward trend since the May average of ~71 units. Lead time is consistently 0. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this most recent stabilization/decline and avoid over-ordering as we move further into June. Holding cost and profit are equal ($1.00), implying the OR backend will target a 50% service level base stock (the median of the demand distribution), which is appropriate given the high visibility of current demand and the tendency for holding costs to accumulate if we overshoot this declining trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: June demand has softened further, averaging ~65 units/period over the last 3 weeks (P16-P18), down from the late May average of ~69.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399256032 continues its downward trend as we move into late June. Period 19 demand was 33 units, a significant drop from the May/June average of ~65. This aligns with seasonal patterns for 'Ankle-length jeans' as summer temperatures rise. The base-stock model (q=0.5, z*=0) implies the target inventory level should be the expected demand (mu_hat) for the current period plus lead time (1+L). Given the recent regime shift, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the accelerating decline in demand (Average P16-P19 is 57.25). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Demand has significantly softened in late June, dropping to 33 in Period 19. The 4-week average has fallen to ~57 units/period, down from ~65 in early June.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399256032 (Womens Ankle Jeans) has continued to drop significantly in late June, with demand levels falling to 33 and 28 units in the last two periods respectively. This follows a broader downward trend from a May average of ~70/period to a late June average of ~30/period. This softening is likely due to seasonal transitions in the 'Womens Everyday Collection' as the summer peak passes. The 4-week average (P17-P20) is approximately 44 units, but focusing on the most recent two periods (P19-P20) showing a mean of 30.5 suggests a further regime shift. Given the Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning base_stock should target the median demand. I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture this sharp downturn while maintaining enough inventory to prevent stockouts if demand stabilizes around 30-40 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Late June/Early July demand has plummeted to ~30 units/period (average of P19-P20), a ~50% decrease from the early June average of ~65.

Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.00), which results in a balanced target service level of 50% (q = 0.5). Given the clear and sustained downward trend over the last three periods (33, 28, 20), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this lower demand regime. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default. Current on-hand inventory is 18, which is nearly sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~20-25 units, so the backend OR order will be appropriately small to avoid overstocking during this low-demand summer period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: July demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging ~24 units/period (P19-P21), down from the late June average of ~30. This represents the summer seasonal low for this item.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256032 (Ankle-length jeans) is currently in its summer seasonal low, according to the calendar (mid-July) and recent historical trends. For Period 22, demand was 33, while the average of the last 4 periods (P19-P22) is approximately 28.5. This confirms the previously identified regime shift where demand plummeted from the spring/early June levels. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (the median of the distribution). To capture the recent stabilization at this low volume while accounting for the most recent data point (33), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4. This ensures the model reacts to the summer floor without over-ordering based on the higher spring volumes.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256032 is currently in late July (2019/7/22). History shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high peak in February/April (~100-120 units), followed by a steady decline through June, hitting a summer low in early July (~20-30 units). However, the most recent demand in Period 23 was 58, which is a significant jump from the previous 4-week average of ~28. This suggests an early 'back-to-school' interest or a mid-summer promotion. Total demand in the last 4 periods (P20-P23) was 28, 20, 33, 58. The average of these 4 periods is 34.75. Given the recent stockout (sold 29 vs demand 58) and the sharp upward trend in Period 23, I will focus on the last 4 periods for mu_hat to capture this transition out of the summer low, while allowing for the increased volatility (sigma_hat) observed in this period. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: The summer low (~24 units/period) has ended with a spike to 58 units in Period 23, signaling a transition into late-summer/pre-autumn demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256032 (Womens skinny ankle jeans) is currently exiting a summer demand trough (minimum of 12-20 units) and showing signs of recovery. Since Period 23, demand spiked to 58 before dropping back to 12 in Period 24. This volatility is characteristic of seasonal 'Back-to-School' or pre-autumn transitions where specific weeks see high spikes. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To manage this transition, I will use a short window (recent_N=4) to capture the shift from the summer low (~24 units) to the emerging pre-autumn pattern without being overly skewed by the single massive spike in P23 or the low in P24. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.00), so the OR backend will target a 50% service level (z=0) for the base stock calculation, effectively ordering to the mean demand plus a risk margin. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 focuses on the most relevant recent behavior (average ~31 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: Exiting summer low (~24 units/period), transitioning to late-summer/pre-autumn volatility with demand ranging between 12 and 58 over the last 3 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Looking at the product description (Ankle-length jeans in washed stretch denim), we are entering the pre-autumn/back-to-school transition. Historically, the summer low was Periods 19-21 (late June/early July) with demand around ~25. Since Period 23, we have seen a significant uptick (58, 12, 30), averaging 33.3 units/period. The volatility is high as the market transitions out of the summer lull. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the inventory strategy should be responsive. To capture the expected gradual rise in autumn demand while managing the observed volatility, I am using a recent_N of 4 (covering the transition periods P22-P25) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the low summer floor with the recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Pre-autumn transition confirmed. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the summer floor, averaging ~33 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P22-P25), up from the July low of ~24.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is transitioning out of its July summer low (~24 units/period) into a pre-autumn phase. Period 26 demand (25 units) followed a period of higher volatility (12 to 58 units). The average demand over the last four periods (P23-P26) is 31.25 units, which aligns with the observed stabilization around 33 units noted in Carry-over Insights. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this post-summer transition regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it reflects the current demand level better than the long-term history which includes the significantly higher spring surge. This setting aim to maintain a lean inventory while covering the observed 30+ unit demand level as autumn approaches.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are exiting the summer low and entering the transition to autumn. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) shows values of 58, 12, 30, 25, and 34, averaging approximately 31.8 units/period. Period 27 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout (demand 34 vs starting inventory 32). Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To capture the current stabilization around 32 units/period while accounting for potential early-autumn volatility, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and sigma calculation. This balances the recent spike in P23 with the more moderate demand observed in the last three weeks.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-26. We are moving from the summer low into the pre-autumn season. Demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P25-P28) with values of 30, 25, 34, and 38, averaging 31.75 units/period. This confirms the transition noted in Period 26. I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized pre-autumn regime while remaining responsive to the slight upward trend seen in the last two weeks (34 and 38). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition stabilized: Demand averaged 31.75 units/period over P25-P28, showing a consistent floor above the July summer low of ~24.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Historically, for this SKU (Skinny Ankle Jeans), we observed a significant demand surge starting in late February/early March, peaking in April (reaching ~120 units), and then normalizing through July to a summer low (~24 units). In late August (Periods 26-29), demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to the July floor, averaging 30.5 units/period (P26: 25, P27: 34, P28: 38, P29: 25). September often marks a transition into autumn fashion cycles, so I anticipate a gradual increase in mean demand. However, to remain responsive without over-stocking during the early transition, I will use a recent window (recent_N=5) to capture the current post-summer stabilization (averaging ~32 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (P25-P29) provides a balanced forecast of 32.4 units per period (multiplied by 1+L=1).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for Skinny Ankle Jeans (SKU 399256032) has stabilized following the summer lows. Since the transition at Period 25 (Late July), demand has been consistently ranging between 25 and 38 units. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is 30.33 units, which is a significant and sustained increase from the July floor of ~24 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent conclude messages. Given the stability in this autumn transition regime, I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 to capture the current mean and volatility. This balances the need for responsiveness to the recent upward shift from summer lows while maintaining enough historical data to estimate variance accurately.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product (Womens Skinny Ankle Jeans) is entering the mid-autumn retail season. Following a summer low (July avg ~24), demand stabilized into a higher autumn transition regime starting Period 26. Since Period 26, weekly demand has been: 25, 34, 38, 25, 30, 34. The average over these last 6 periods is 31, which is remarkably consistent given the category. There is no evidence of a significant upward spike yet, but with the weather cooling, a seasonal lift is possible. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture this stable autumn floor (avg ~31). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety margin for volatility (standard deviation), which has been moderate in this period (std ~5.2). Balancing unit profit ($1) against holding cost ($1) results in a critical ratio of 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand for base stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand from Period 26 to Period 31 is 31 units/period, representing a sustained increase from the summer low of ~24.

LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256032 is currently in a stable autumn demand regime. Over the last seven periods (Period 26 to Period 32), demand has averaged 30.85 units per period with relatively low volatility. The most recent demand (P32) was 30 units, aligning perfectly with this average. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, as confirmed by every concluded order in the history arriving in the same period it was placed. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the OR backend's critical ratio (q) will be 0.5, aiming for the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized autumn regime and ensure we maintain enough stock to cover the current period's demand while minimizing excess ending inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand for SKU 399256032 has been in a stable autumn regime since late August. Over the last 5 periods (P29-P33), demand has been consistently between 25 and 38 units, with an average of approximately 31.4 units per period. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Because profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should ideally align with the median demand. I will use recent_N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this stabilized autumn demand while filtering out the higher volatility seen earlier in the transition. This will provide a balanced inventory level that covers the expected demand without excessive holding costs, especially given current zero inventory on-hand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. Over the last nine periods (P26-P34), the demand for SKU 399256032 (Womens Ankle Jeans) has stabilized into a consistent autumn regime with an average demand of approximately 32.2 units per period (ranging from 25 to 38). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand of the relevant regime. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture this stable autumn regime (P26-P34) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the parameters reflect the most recent trend while filtering out the volatile summer and spring data.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399256032 (Ankle-length jeans) has been remarkably stable throughout September and early October. Since the autumn transition stabilized (around Period 29), demand has consistently hovered between 25 and 38 units. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P26-P35) is 31.9 units. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. The OR engine will use a quantile of 0.5 because profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0). Given the high stability and the seasonal nature of 'Ankle-length jeans' (which may see a dip as winter approaches), I will use the recent 10-period window to capture the current stabilized autumn regime while maintaining sufficient stock for the observed variance.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product is Women's Trousers (Ankle-length jeans). Historical demand shows a stabilization in the autumn regime (since approximately Period 26) with an average around 31-33 units per period. However, the most recent demand (Period 36) was notably low at 13 units, causing on-hand inventory to rise to 19. Despite this dip, the 10-period average (P27-P36) remains approx 31 units per period. I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture the current autumn stabilization while smoothing out the most recent outlier. Lead time is consistently 0. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to maintain the current service level without over-reacting to one low-demand week.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for SKU 399256032 (Womens Everyday Trousers) has significantly softened in late October. The last two periods (P36-P37) recorded demand of 13 units, down from the September/Early-October average of ~31 units. This suggests a seasonal decline as we move towards the end of Autumn. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the drop in demand, I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent window (N=3) to capture this downward shift (P35-P37: 29, 13, 13; average ~18.3). Sigma_hat will also be adjusted using recent history (N=5) to reflect the current lower-volume volatility. Inventory is currently at 18 units on-hand, which almost covers the new expected demand window (L+1 = 1 period) without ordering much more, aligning with the backend OR logic to minimize holding costs while the profit/holding ratio is 1:1 (targeting a 50% cycle service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Late October demand has plummeted to 13 units/period (average of P36-P37), a ~60% decrease from the September/early-October average of ~31.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November. Historically, demand for this item (Womens Skinny Ankle Jeans) plummeted in late October, dropping from an autumn average of ~31 units to approximately 14 units over the last three periods (P36-P38). The current period is November 4th. This product is likely entering a late-autumn/pre-holiday lull or end-of-season clearance phase. I will set the demand mean (mu_hat) using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this new low-volume regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same window to capture the current volatility of this drop. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment. The goal is to minimize holding costs while the item is in this low-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 39: Late October/Early November demand has dropped significantly, averaging 14 units/period (P36-P38), a >50% decrease from the previous autumn stabilization level of 31 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for SKU 399256032 has significantly dropped since late October, entering a late-autumn low. The last four periods (P36-P39) show demand values of 13, 13, 16, and 15, resulting in a stable mean of approximately 14.25 units/period. This represents a distinct regime shift from the early October average of ~31 units/period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower demand floor and prevent over-ordering as we move deeper into November, which historically shows low demand for this 'Everyday Collection' denim SKU before any potential holiday spikes.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a low-demand regime for SKU 399256032 (Women's Skinny Jeans). Demand has significantly dropped from the autumn average of ~31 units to a late-autumn/winter average of ~14 units (P36-P40 demand: 13, 13, 16, 15, 11). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Inventory is currently 4 units on-hand. Given the product type and the calendar, we are entering the pre-holiday season, but currently, demand is stable at this low floor. I will use a recent_N of 5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability at this lower volume regime (~13.6 average). L remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~14 units/period (P36-P40) following the late October plumet, representing a new seasonally low baseline for the late-autumn period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' has entered a late-autumn/winter low-volume regime. Over the last 6 periods (P36-P41), demand has averaged 12.0 units per period (13, 13, 16, 15, 11, 4), which is significantly lower than the preceding autumn stabilization of ~31 units. The most recent demand (P41) was 4 units, suggesting a potential further dip or high local volatility. The promised and actual lead times are consistently 0 periods. Based on this sustained low-volume regime, I am setting the demand parameters using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current mean of 12.0 and the associated variance. This helps avoid over-ordering during a seasonal low while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, which targets a 50% service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Late November demand has further softened, with the 6-week average at ~12 units/period (P36-P41), and a recent single-period low of 4 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Based on carry-over insights and recent history, the demand for SKU 399256032 (Womens Ankle Jeans) has stabilized at a late-autumn/winter low. Over the last 7 periods (P36-P42), demand has averaged 11.5 units per period (13, 13, 16, 15, 11, 4, 9). The most recent three periods (P40-P42) average 8 units per period, showing a significant drop compared to the previous stabilization at ~14. Given we are in early December, demand is expected to remain in this low-volume regime. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-autumn stabilization while staying responsive to the most recent dip. The OR backend will calculate a base stock target of ~12-15 units based on these parameters and the equal profit/holding cost ($1.00), which effectively targets the median demand to minimize inventory risk in a low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: Early December demand has stabilized at a seasonal low, averaging ~11.5 units/period over the last 7 weeks (P36-P42), with the most recent 3 weeks averaging only 8 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019. Demand for SKU 399256032 (Womens Ankle Jeans) has remained in a stable, seasonal low throughout November and early December. Over the last 8 periods (P36-P43), the average demand is 11.25 units. The most recent 3 periods show remarkable stability with demand values of 4, 9, and 9 (average ~7.3 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the median demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this low demand regime while maintaining some buffer for minor weekly fluctuations, ensuring we don't overstock during this seasonally slow period.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019/12/16). Demand for this item has hit a seasonal low as indicated by the 'Everyday Collection' trousers entering the deep winter period. The demand regime has been extremely stable at a low volume for the last 9 periods (P36-P44), averaging 11.0 units per period, with the most recent 5 periods (P40-P44) specifically averaging 8.2 units. Given the profit and holding cost are 1:1, the target service level is 50%, meaning we want the base stock to closely align with the median demand. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the full scope of the late-autumn/winter stabilization while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate variance for a 50% service level. This conservative approach prevents over-ordering during the seasonal trough.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019 (Period 46). We are in the final two periods of the simulation. For SKU 399256032 (Women's Trousers), demand has stabilized at a seasonal low, with a recent 10-period average (P36-P45) of approximately 11.3 units/period and a 5-period average (P41-P45) of 8.2 units/period. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and responsive inventory management. With only two periods remaining and a holding cost equal to the profit ($1.0), it is crucial to avoid overstocking while meeting the likely low demand. I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent late-autumn/winter demand baseline (~8.2 units), as the 10-period average includes the initial drop-off from 31 units which is no longer representative. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to reflect current volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, representing the year-end period. Demand for this item (Skinny Ankle Jeans) has been in a sustained low seasonal regime since late October. Over the last 11 periods (P36-P46), demand has averaged 10.3 units. More specifically, the last 5 periods (P42-P46) show an even lower average of 8 units per period (9, 9, 8, 11, 3). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Given the very low demand and high variance relative to the mean (coefficient of variation is high when demand is in single digits), I will use a conservative recent window (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents over-ordering during the lowest point of the winter season while maintaining enough safety stock to cover small fluctuations. The target base stock will effectively be mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, which at these levels should keep inventory lean to minimize holding costs which equal profit ($1.0 each).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 47: Late December demand has reached a seasonal nadir, averaging 8 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P42-P46), down from the previous late-autumn stabilization of ~14 units.
