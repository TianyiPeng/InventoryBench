Period 1 demand was 101 units, which is slightly below the historical average. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' paperwaist trouser, which typically sees consistent demand in early spring (February). 4. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline suggests 99 units.

Strategy: A target base stock for a lead time of 0 (covering current period demand) should be around the historical mean of ~134 plus a safety buffer.

Given the product (Women's Trousers) and the spring date (March 18), demand is likely to remain elevated compared to January/early February. 5. Strategy: A base stock level covering expected demand (~150) plus safety stock is needed. Using the recent average of 150, and accounting for the 25 units on hand, an order of 150 - 25 = 125 units would just cover the mean.

Demand has dropped from ~170 (Periods 6-7) to 146 (P8), 111 (P9), and finally 77 (P10). This downward shift coincides with the transition from early spring into late April. The garment (viscose blend paperbag waist trousers) may be seeing a seasonal dip after an initial spring release. The historical mean of ~139 is now heavily skewed by higher early demand that no longer reflects the current environment.\n3. **Inventory & OR Recommendation**: We currently have 84 units on hand. The OR recommendation is 76 units, which would result in a total inventory of 160 units for Period 11. Given that the most recent demand was 77, and the trend is sharply downward, 160 units (over 2x current demand) would likely lead to excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit).\n4. **Adjustment**: I will target a stock level of approximately 110-115 units to provide a safety buffer against the downward trend without incurring high holding costs.

The lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed.
