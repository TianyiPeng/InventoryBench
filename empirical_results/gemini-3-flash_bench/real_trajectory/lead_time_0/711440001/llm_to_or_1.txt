Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 11, 2019. The product is a 'Wrapover top in jersey' (Sweater/Womens Tailoring). Historical demand was stable around 10-11 units for January, but spiked significantly to 74 units on Feb 4, 2019. This coincides with the lead-up to Valentine's Day (Feb 14) and potentially the transition to Spring/workwear. Current period demand (Feb 11-17) is expected to remain high due to the holiday and seasonal shift. On-hand and in-transit are currently 0. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this sudden regime shift, as the historical mean is too low. I estimate mu_hat (1+L where L=0) to be around 75 units, reflecting the most recent demand level, with a high sigma_hat to handle the transition volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a massive demand spike (98 units) compared to the historical training data (average ~11, then one jump to 74). This product is a 'Wrapover top in jersey', and the date is mid-February, which aligns with the start of Spring/Pre-Spring fashion transitions. The Period 1 demand of 98 suggests a significant regime shift from the early January baseline. Since we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and the lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, we need to restock immediately to meet this higher demand level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to incorporate the recent 74 and 98 demand levels, setting the expected demand significantly higher than the January average to avoid stockouts. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to capture the increased volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-04: average jumped from ~11 to ~86 (based on last two observations of 74 and 98).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Womens Wrapover Top) has entered a significant demand regime shift starting in early February. Historical demand baseline was ~11, but recent observations for Period 1 and Period 2 are 98 and 107 respectively. Despite placing orders equal to the estimated mean, ending inventory has been 0, indicating lost sales and that the current mean is likely above 100. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on the last two 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to forecast for the next period (1+L = 1 period) at 110 units to account for the upward trend and capture the demand that has been exceeding our supply. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly at 15 to provide a buffer for the high variance observed during this growth phase. Since L=0 and OH=0, the backend will order approximately mu_hat - 0, truncated by the cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: demand increased from ~11/week to ~102/week (avg of P1 and P2) starting Feb 2019. Trend is currently upward.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Womens Wrapover Top) underwent a massive demand shift starting in February 2019, jumping from ~11 units/week to a high-volume regime. Looking at the last three periods (P1: 98, P2: 107, P3: 81), the average demand is 95.33 units. While P3 (81 units) was lower than P2, it remains significantly above the baseline of 11. Given this is a women's transition/fancy garment in early March, demand is expected to remain high during the spring season. The lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period as ordered). Lead_time L=0 implies mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations for (1+L)=1 period. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (N=3 captures the post-shift regime) and \u03c3_hat to allow for the observed volatility (range 81-107). Current on-hand is 29; the backend OR will subtract this from the base_stock to determine the order.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Jersey Fancy Wrapover top) experienced a significant demand spike starting February 2019, likely due to spring/transitional seasonality. Demand in the last four periods (Periods 1-4) has been 98, 107, 81, and 67, averaging 88.25 units per week. There is a noticeable cooling trend from the initial peak of 107. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. For Period 5 (March 11), demand is expected to remain in this elevated 'spring' regime but may continue to stabilize or decline slightly from the February peak. I will use a mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current mean while acknowledging the recent downward trend. Sigma_hat is also set using N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility of this high-demand period compared to the January baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: After the Feb peak (107), demand is mean-reverting toward ~80 units (Avg P3-P4 is 74).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Women's Wrapover Sweater) underwent a significant demand spike in February (peaking at 107 units), which has since entered a cooling phase as we move into mid-March. The last three periods show a clear downward trend: 81, 67, and 44 units. The average demand for the 'stabilized' regime mentioned in carry-over insights was ~80, but the most recent observation of 44 suggests the mean-reversion is deeper than initially estimated, or the item is losing seasonal momentum. Given the current on-hand inventory of 45 units and the 0-period lead time, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent deceleration (average ~64) while maintaining enough buffer for potential volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as lead time has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: March demand dropping significantly from February peak (P3: 81 -> P5: 44).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Women's Wrapover Jersey Sweater) experienced a significant demand spike in February (Periods 1-2, peaking at 107 units), but has since entered a cooling phase in March. Recent demand for the last four weeks (Periods 3-6) has been 81, 67, 44, and 55, resulting in an average of 61.75 units. The most recent demand (55) suggests a stabilization or continued moderate decline compared to the peak. We have 9 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the OR backend logic targets a 50% service level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent post-peak demand regime, setting \u03bc\u0302 to approximately 62 per period. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to account for the reduced volatility in this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed post-February peak: mean demand for Periods 3-6 is ~62 units, significantly lower than the ~102 units observed in early February.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a women's wrapover jersey top, which saw a significant demand surge in February (average demand ~102) but has since cooled down. Over the last four periods (Periods 4-7), demand has stabilized at a lower mean: 67, 44, 55, and 44, resulting in an average of 52.5 units per period. The recent N approach (N=4) captures this stabilization post-peak better than the total history. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will set L to 'default' (0), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to align with the current demand regime (~53 units per period), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the current volatility (std \u2248 10.6). With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock roughly equal to the expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: Demand for Periods 4-7 has settled around a mean of 52.5 units, down from the February average of ~100.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Wrapover top in jersey', a piece of women's tailoring. Historical demand showed a significant peak in early February (Periods 1-2, demand ~100) followed by a cooling trend in March. Currently, in early April (Period 9), demand appears to be stabilizing. Looking at the last 4 periods (P5-P8), demand was 44, 55, 44, 65, resulting in a mean of 52. Since P8 demand saw a slight uptick to 65 and we stock out frequently (ending inventory 0 in P1, P2, and P8), I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the last 4 periods to reflect this stabilized post-peak regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. Setting N=4 for mu_hat captures the recent stability while excluding the high-demand February outliers. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's sweater/wrapover top. We are in a post-peak seasonal phase. Recently, demand has shown a clear decline: Feb avg ~102, March avg ~57.5, and the latest Period 9 demand was 32. This indicates a weakening demand regime as we move further into spring. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current demand level (Eras 6-9: 55, 44, 65, 32; Mean=49) while excluding the much higher February spikes. Balancing the profit and holding cost (both $1.0) implies a target service level of 0.50, meaning the base stock should closely follow the mean demand. The on-hand inventory is 20, and the demand cooling is significant, so a more localized average is appropriate to prevent overstocking as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April demand is continuing the cooling trend observed in March (P9 demand: 32 vs March avg: ~57.5). Expect mean demand to stabilize around 40-50 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Women's Wrapover Sweater) is experiencing a clear post-peak decline as we move further into spring (April 22nd). Historically, demand spiked in February (~100 units/week) and has been steadily decreasing through March (~52 units/week) and now April (P9: 32, P10: 24). The current demand of 24 units confirms the transition out of sweater season. To avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit, $1.0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 'recent_N' of 3 to capture the most recent cooling phase (P8-P10 avg demand \u2248 40). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'arrived' messages in the same period as ordering. This strategy aims to bring base stock in line with the current lower demand regime while maintaining a tight inventory level.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: April demand (avg ~28) is significantly lower than March (avg ~52), reflecting seasonal exit for knitwear/sweaters.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Wrapover top... and long, cuffed sleeves', which is representative of late winter/early spring apparel. We are currently at Period 12 (2019/04/29), approaching May. Historical demand shows a clear peak in February (avg ~102) followed by a steady cooling trend through March (avg ~52) and April (avg ~27). The last three periods (P9-P11) have shown very stable, low demand: 32, 24, and 24 units. Given this terminal seasonal phase, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 3 periods (average = 26.66). Since L=0, (1+L)*26.66 \u2248 27. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by eleven consecutive 'conclude' messages. I am using recent_N for both mean and sigma to capture the lower volatility and mean of this current low-demand regime, preventing over-ordering on outdated winter peak data.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Jersey Fancy V-neck Sweater) has entered a clear seasonal cooling phase as we move into May. Demand has dropped from a February peak of >100 units/week to a steady decline through March and April. The last four periods (P9-P12) show demand values of 32, 24, 24, and 22, respectively, averaging approximately 25.5 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Given that Profit equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand for the lead period plus review period (1+L=1 total period). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this stabilized late-spring demand regime, ensuring the inventory levels are tight to minimize holding costs as the product exits its peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed for May: April to early May demand (P9-P12) has settled at a mean of ~25 units, significantly down from the March average of ~52 and February average of ~100.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Womens Sweater/Wrapover top) is in a clear seasonal decline typical for May. Demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) with a mean of 24.8 units (32, 24, 24, 22, 22). This is a significant drop from the February peak (~100) and March average (~50). Historical data from 2019-01-07 to 2019-01-28 showed a baseline demand of ~11 units per week before the spring transition. As we move further into May, demand is expected to remain low or continue a slow decline towards that baseline. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stabilized 'low-season' demand regime. The lead time remains consistently 0. Setting parameters to target a base stock around 25-30 units to satisfy demand while minimizing holding costs (which equal profit per unit) in a low-growth period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Jersey Fancy Wrapover top/Sweater) is in a post-peak seasonal cooling phase. Period 14 (May 13) unexpectedly saw a spike to 40 units (up from the preceding 4-week average of ~23). However, given the product type (long-sleeved jersey) and the date moving into late May, this spike is likely an outlier rather than a new upward trend. Historically, the lead time has remained stable at 0 periods. To account for the recent volatility while respecting the overall downward seasonal trend, I will use a recent_N window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent uptick (40 units) while still weighing it against the preceding lower demand weeks (22, 22, 24, 24), resulting in a balanced base stock for the period. The profit/holding cost ratio of 1.0 (Critical Ratio = 0.5) means the target service level is centered on the mean, keeping inventory lean as we move further into the warm season.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Wrapover top in jersey with long, cuffed sleeves', which is transitioning into late May (Period 16). Historical data shows that after the heavy February peak (avg ~100), demand cooled through March and April, settling into a stable regime in May. Recent demand for the last 4 periods (P12-P15) has been 22, 22, 40, and 25, averaging ~27 units. The outlier of 40 in P14 suggests some residual volatility, but the overall trend is stabilized. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture this May stabilization phase for the base stock calculation, ensuring we stay responsive to the lower late-spring demand levels while maintaining enough stock for periodic spikes.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-06-03. The product is a jersey wrapover top (sweater/knitwear), which has exited its peak February season and has been in a sustained decline through spring. Recent demand (Periods 12-16) has been: 22, 22, 40, 25, 9. Although there was a brief spike to 40 in Period 14, the most recent reading of 9 units in Period 16 confirms that demand is tapering off as summer begins. The mean of the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 23.6, but given the specific drop to single digits in the most recent period, I will use a shorter window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering during this seasonal transition where demand is at its lowest. Historically, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, so I will maintain 'calculate' for L. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for June: May demand average (~24 units) has further declined, with the most recent period (P16) dropping to 9 units, signaling a summer seasonal low for this knitwear product.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey wrapover top/sweater, currently in the summer season (June 10th). Historically, demand for this item has significantly declined from its February peak (avg ~100) to a May average of ~24 units. The most recent two periods (P16-P17) show a further dip (9 and 15 units respectively), suggesting a new seasonal low as we move into summer. I am using a recent window of 5 periods (P13-P17) to capture this lower mean (avg ~22) and variance while ignoring the higher spring and winter data. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The base stock will aim to cover the current week's estimated demand of ~20 units, adjusted for the 9 units remaining on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal low confirmed for June: Transition from May (avg ~24) to early June (avg ~12 for P16-P17) underscores a significant reduction in demand for jersey wrapover tops/sweaters.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (wrapover top/sweater) is in a confirmed summer low as of mid-June 2019. Demand have significantly dropped from earlier peaks (100+) to a recent average of approximately 12 units (P16-P18: 9, 15, 12). Current on-hand inventory is 11 units, which nearly covers one period of expected demand at the current rate. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should target the mean demand. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P16-P18) to reflect this summer trough, ensuring the OR backend maintains a lean inventory level to avoid holding costs during this low-demand season. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Jersey wrapover top/sweater) is currently in a summer seasonal low. Demand has consistently declined from a February peak of ~100 to a June average of approximately 12 units (Periods 16-19: 9, 15, 12, 12). Period 19 demand was 12, and ending inventory is 0. Given the 'Womens Tailoring / Jersey Fancy / Sweater' description and current date (June 24), we are in the peak of summer with very low relevance for this product. The 'promised' lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture this stabilized summer floor (~12 units) while keeping \u03c3\u0302 tight to avoid overstocking a low-demand item with high relative holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Emerald Sweater/Wrapover top) is in a clear summer seasonal low, coinciding with July (Date 2019/7/1). Demand has stabilized at very low levels over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), with sales/demands of 9, 15, 12, 12, and 9. The average demand for this summer regime is approximately 11.4 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 3 units with 0 in-transit. Given that lead time has consistently been 0, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this low-demand summer floor. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods will allow the OR backend to maintain a lean inventory appropriate for the low summer volume while accounting for the small fluctuations observed (between 9 and 15 units).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Jersey wrapover top/sweater) is in its summer seasonal low as expected for July. Since Period 16, demand has consistently stayed in the range of 8-15 units. Historical demand for the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) is 15, 12, 12, 9, 8, yielding a mean of 11.2 and a standard deviation of 2.7. The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time has consistently remained 0 in all concluded periods. Therefore, I will use recent_N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stable low-demand regime, ensuring we do not over-order and incur high holding costs, which are equal to the profit ($1/unit).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey wrapover top, which is experiencing a clear seasonal decline during the summer months (June-July). Demand has decreased from a peak of ~100 units in February to a recent average of approximately 8.6 units over the last 5 periods (P18-P22). The most recent demand was 4 units. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this low-demand regime, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5. This captures the current summer demand level (~8 units per week) while allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the low volatility observed recently. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a jersey wrapover top (sweater/knitwear), currently in the height of the summer season (July 22nd). Observed demand from Period 19 to Period 23 (mid-June to mid-July) has been consistently low: 12, 9, 8, 4, 4. This follows the previously identified seasonal decline. The mean demand over these last 5 periods (N=5) is 7.4 units. Given Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.00), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50, which means the base stock should target the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized summer low and prevent over-ordering as the demand has mean-reverted to a single-digit range.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor reached: July demand average (P21-P23) has settled at ~5.3 units, confirming the lower bound of the seasonal cycle for this knitwear product.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a knitwear/sweater item currently at its summer seasonal low (late July). Demand has consistently stabilized at a very low level for the past four periods (P21-P24 demand: 8, 4, 4, 5), establishing a new regime with a mean of approximately 5.25 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as every order has arrived within the same period. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the service level target (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to match this current seasonal floor while maintaining sigma_hat on the same window to capture the minimal volatility at this level.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-05. The product is a jersey wrapover top (knitwear), which has been in a summer seasonal low since June. However, Period 25 (July 29) showed a sudden demand spike to 18 units, compared to the July average of ~5.3 units. This likely signals the beginning of the 'Back to School' or early autumn transition for apparel. Demand is moving away from the summer floor of ~5 units. I will use a short-window recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this pivot while remaining cautious about the single-period jump. L is consistent at 0. Since Profit = $1.0 and Holding Cost = $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand. I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility increase.

Carry-over insight: Early autumn demand pivot detected: Period 25 demand (18 units) is 3x higher than the July average (~6 units), suggesting the end of the summer seasonal low.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Emerald Wrapover Jersey top (SKU 711440001) has entered a clear autumn upswing. Period 26 demand (30 units) follows Period 25 (18 units), both significantly higher than the July average of ~6 units. This confirms the 'autumn pivot' noted in the previous carry-over insight. Given it is now mid-August (2019/08/12), we are entering the primary sales season for long-sleeved jersey knitwear. The last two periods (mean=24) suggest a rapid return to levels seen in late Spring. To prevent the stockouts observed in the last two periods (sold < demand), I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 2 periods to capture the jump, but use an explicit higher value to account for the clear upward momentum and lead time protection against stockouts. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery confirmed: August demand (Periods 25-26) averaged 24 units, a 4x increase from July's low of 6 units, signaling the start of the A/W seasonal peak.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Emerald Wrapover Top (SKU 711440001) is currently in a sharp autumn recovery phase as we approach late August. Demand has increased from a summer low of ~6 units (July) to 18, 30, and most recently 64 units in Period 27. This confirms the seasonal trend identified in previous periods where late Q3 demand spikes similarly to the early Q1 peaks (February saw demand >100). The current mean demand of the last 3 periods is approx. 37 units (18, 30, 64), but the trend is clearly accelerating (+100% week-over-week). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid the stockouts seen in the last three periods (sold < demand), I will set mu_hat conservatively higher than the last observed demand to capture the upward trajectory, while sigma_hat is adjusted to account for the high volatility during seasonal transitions. Using Recent_N=3 for mu_hat would result in ~37 units, which is already obsolete given Period 27 demand was 64; therefore, I will use 'explicit' to forecast 75 units for the upcoming period to preemptively build stock for this A/W ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal surge confirmed: Demand has grown from 18 to 64 units over the last 3 periods (Period 25-27), indicating a rapid ramp-up towards Q1-like peak levels.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Women's Jersey Wrapover top) is currently in a rapid autumn recovery phase. Demand surged from single digits in July to an average of 52 units over the last three weeks (P26: 30, P27: 64, P28: 62). This trajectory suggests a return to the high-demand levels observed during February (~80-100 units). Given the Promised Lead Time is 0 and the Actual Lead Time consistently remains 0, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture this sharp upward trend. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility associated with the seasonal transition. This positioning ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate rather than the summer lows.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal recovery confirmed: Demand increased from ~6 units in July to a three-week average of ~52 units in August (P26-P28), signaling a return to peak season levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Wrapover top in jersey', which shows a strong seasonal pattern. We are currently in early September (2019/9/2), which is the beginning of the Autumn/Winter (A/W) retail season. Historical demand shows a significant surge starting in Period 25 (July 29), with demand increasing from ~6 units in July to an average of ~64 units over the last three periods (P27-P29). The most recent demand (P29) was 67 units, and we experienced a stockout (sold 52, demand 67). This indicates that demand has stabilized at a high 'peak season' level similar to the start of the year. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P27-P29) to capture this new high-demand regime while maintaining a high service level to prevent further stockouts during this ramp-up. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak season fully established: Demand for P27-P29 averaged 64 units, recovering from a summer low of ~6 units. Stockouts in 3 of the last 5 periods (P25, P26, P27, P29) confirm demand is outpacing previous conservative estimates.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Jersey wrapover top) is entering its peak Autumn/Winter seasonal phase. Period 30 saw a significant demand spike to 131 units, which is more than double the previous three-week average (~64 units). Since the product description is 'Womens Tailoring | Jersey Fancy | Wrapover top' and we are in early September, demand is expected to remain high and potentially increase as the weather cools. The inventory sold out in Period 30 (on-hand 0), and several stockouts have occurred recently (P25, P26, P27, P29, P30), indicating our 'mu_hat' has consistently lagged behind actual demand. To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I am shifting from 'recent_N' to an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 120 (reflecting the recent 131 spike moderated slightly but acknowledging the upward momentum) and use an 'explicit' sigma_hat of 30 to handle the high volatility seen in the transition to peak season (from 67 to 131 in two periods). Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent history.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal peak acceleration: Period 30 demand (131) doubled the August average (~64), showing significantly higher velocity than the initial Autumn ramp-up.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's wrapover top (knitwear), entering its peak Autumn/Winter season. Current demand is accelerating rapidly: Period 30 was 131 units and Period 31 was 164 units. We have stocked out in seven of the last eight periods (P25, P26, P27, P29, P30, P31), indicating our base stock calculations are consistently trailing the actual demand surge. The September average is now ~147 units, significantly higher than the August average of ~52. Given the stockouts, true demand is likely even higher than observed sales. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 180 to get ahead of the trend and prevent further lost sales, as the current momentum suggests demand will continue to climb toward or exceed the 164 units seen last period. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to account for the high volatility during this ramp-up phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand acceleration confirmed: Period 30-31 demand averaged 147.5 units, a 130% increase over the August average of 64 units. Frequent stockouts reflect demand consistently exceeding supply in the Q3 ramp-up.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Jersey Wrapover Top) is in its Autumn/Winter peak season. Demand in September has accelerated significantly, with the last three periods recording 131, 164, and 131 units respectively, giving a mean of 142 units. This is a substantial increase over the August average of ~64. Although demand dipped from 164 to 131 in the most recent period, it remains very high compared to historical levels, and stockouts in P30 and P31 indicate that previous ordering was still too conservative. The current on-hand inventory is 49 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (last 3 periods) to ensure we cover the current velocity of ~142 units. I will use N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and high mean of this peak phase.

Carry-over insight: September peak demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P30-P32 is 142 units, a 120% increase over the August average (~64 units), marking the full transition to Autumn/Winter peak levels.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Women's Jersey Wrapover top/sweater) has entered an intense Autumn/Winter peak phase. Period 33 demand spiked dramatically to 293 units, doubling the already high average of the preceding three periods (~142 units). This surge has resulted in another stockout (sold 142 of 293 demand). Given the product description and current date (2019/09/30), we are entering the core Q4 retail season where sweaters and long-sleeve items peak. I am shifting the mu_hat forecast to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the rapid acceleration from ~60 to ~290. Using a 4-period window (P30-P33) results in a mean of (131+164+131+293)/4 = 179.75. Since L=0 and lead time is consistently 0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover this higher velocity. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to account for the increased volatility (Standard Deviation 76.5) seen during this peak ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Peak A/W demand surge confirmed: Period 33 demand (293) represents a 100% increase over the September average (~142), indicating high-velocity Q4 seasonality for knitwear.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak Autumn/Winter demand regime for this knitwear product. Period 33 saw a massive demand spike (293), followed by a lower observation in Period 34 (96), which suggests high volatility or potential stockout-influenced reporting. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 143 units. Since the lead time is 0, we need to ensure the base stock (on-hand + arriving order) covers the upcoming period's demand. Given the stockouts in P30, P31, and P33, the observed demand likely underestimates true demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (capturing the September/October surge) to balance the high P33 value with the P34 correction, ensuring we maintain a high service level for this peak period where profit and holding costs are equal (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in peak A/W season: Period 33-34 saw a swing from 293 to 96 units, with a 5-period average of ~143 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the Autumn/Winter peak season for this knitwear product (wrapover jersey top). Demand has been highly volatile in recent periods: 131, 164, 131, 293, 96, and 60. While the most recent two periods (96 and 60) show a decline, the massive spike of 293 in Period 33 warns against underestimating the peak capacity. Currently, the mean demand of the last 6 periods (P30-P35) is approximately 129 units. Using recent_N=6 captures this peak volatility. On-hand inventory is 103, which is sufficient to cover about 0.8 periods of average demand, but given we have experienced several stockouts in the ramp-up (P30, P31, P33), maintaining a robust base stock is necessary to handle potential Q4 surges or weekly spikes. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to reflect this peak regime and sigma_hat similarly to account for the high standard deviation observed during the A/W transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high during the A/W peak: Period 33-35 demand sequence (293 -> 96 -> 60) shows extreme variance while maintaining a high average (~150) compared to summer months.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Jersey wrapover top/sweater) is in its Autumn/Winter peak season. However, recent demand observations (P34: 96, P35: 60, P36: 40) indicate a significant cool-down from the late September peak of 293. The current mean demand for the last 3 periods is roughly 65 units, while the peak average was much higher. In Period 36, demand dropped to 40, leaving an on-hand inventory of 106 units. Given the seasonal nature of sweaters, this drop suggests we are moving past the initial Q4 volume surge. With a lead time of 0, the current on-hand inventory (106) already covers over 2.5 periods of the most recent demand (40). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period window (N=4), which includes the extreme peak (293) and the recent troughs, providing a balanced but conservative estimate of 122.25 units per period. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility observed during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak A/W demand cooling detected: Demand has dropped for three consecutive periods (96, 60, 40) from a peak of 293. Mean demand for P34-P36 (~65) is significantly lower than the September peak average (~142).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Women's wrapover jersey top) is currently in the post-peak phase of the Autumn/Winter season. Demand has significantly cooled from the late September peak of 293 units. The last four demand observations are 96, 60, 40, and 63. While the most recent period saw a slight uptick from 40 to 63, the overall trend since Period 33 is downward. The mean demand for the last four periods (P34-P37) is 64.75 units. I will use a recent window of N=4 to capture this stabilization level, which is consistent with the early Autumn ramp-up levels and avoids overreacting to the extreme September peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory of 60 units is almost sufficient to cover one period of the current mean demand (~65), so a moderate replenishment order is expected from the OR backend to maintain safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak A/W demand stabilization: Following the September peak (293), demand has stabilized over the last 4 periods (P34-P37) at an average of ~65 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are in the Autumn/Winter peak season for this knitwear SKU. Demand has shown significant volatility in October, with the most recent Period 38 jumping to 110 units from a previous four-period average of ~65. This spike suggests that the 'cooling trend' noted in previous periods may have been premature or that a secondary peak is occurring as we enter November. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the high demand in P38 exceeding the conservative order. To restore service levels and capture this renewed demand velocity, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the higher volatility and specific October-November behavior (averaging ~74 units per period across P34-P38) rather than the long-term or summer averages. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level capable of handling the current ~110 unit bursts while protecting against the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in late Q4: Period 38 demand (110 units) represents a 75% increase over the P34-P37 average (~65), suggesting a secondary seasonal peak in November.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Jersey wrapover top/sweater) is in its Autumn/Winter peak season. Demand has been highly volatile in Q4: Period 38 saw 110 units and Period 39 saw 76 units, with stockouts in both periods due to inventory starting at 0 or near-zero levels. This suggests the recent 'cooling' trend noted in Periods 34-37 has likely reversed into a secondary November peak or stabilization period. The promised lead time is 0 and historical lead times have consistently been 0, so L is set to 0. To capture the current regime and recover from recent stockouts, I am using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (Avg P36-P39: ~72 units) to reflect the recent demand levels (40, 63, 110, 76), and a recent_N of 4 for sigma_hat to account for the high variance (Std Dev ~29) observed in this peak window. This aims to set a base stock that satisfies the current 70+ units/week demand while providing a safety buffer for the 100+ unit volatility seen in Period 38.

Carry-over insight: Late Q4 demand stabilization: Demand for Periods 37-39 has shifted from the October low (40 units) to a higher mean of ~83 units, confirming a secondary peak or stabilization in November.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019-11-11 was 72 units, which aligns with the trend observed in the last two periods (76 and 72). The average demand for the current November regime (Periods 39-40) is 74 units, indicating a stabilization following the secondary peak of 110 units in Period 38. With a promised lead time of 0 and actual lead times consistently at 0, I will set L to 0. For mu_hat, I am choosing the average of the most recent 2 periods (N=2) to reflect this stable 74-unit demand level while remaining responsive to any late-November volatility. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the standard deviation of the last four weeks (110, 76, 72 plus current) to account for the heightened variance seen in late Q4. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock to satisfy demand while minimizing holding costs in a period where we've recently experienced both stockouts and narrow inventory margins.

Carry-over insight: November demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 39-40 show a mean demand of 74 units, a decrease from the mid-November spike of 110 but significantly higher than the October trough (40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late November (2019/11/25), entering the final weeks of the A/W season for this 'Wrapover top'. Demand has stabilized significantly since the extreme September peak and October trough. Over the last three periods (P39-P41), demand was 76, 72, and 45 units respectively. While P41 shows a drop to 45, the average of this stabilizing regime (P39-P41) is approximately 64.3 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1, implying a 50% service level target in a simple model, but the capped policy logic targets higher), and the recent volatility, I will focus on the most recent three periods to set the forecast. This allows us to capture the current stabilization while acknowledging the slight downward pressure seen in the most recent week. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 throughout the history, so L is set to default.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '711440001' (a jersey wrapover top) is currently in a high-volatility late Q4 phase. In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked to 148 units, significantly exceeding the previous four-period average (~75 units). This follows the pattern observed in late October/early November (P38-P40) where demand fluctuated between 72 and 110 units. Given the transition into early December, we must account for a potential sustainment of this higher demand level before the end-of-year drop. I will use an N=5 recent average for mu_hat (P38-P42 average is ~90 units) to capture the recent mean, but use an explicit sigma_hat of 45 to account for the high variance (observed swings between 45 and 148). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the P42 stockout, the OR backend needs to place a substantial order to cover the current period's expected high demand.

Carry-over insight: Late Q4 volatility confirmed: Demand in late November (P42) spiked to 148 units, nearly double the early November average (~73 units), indicating significant pre-holiday variance.

The SKU 711440001 (Women's Jersey Wrapover Sweater) is in the middle of its Autumn/Winter peak season. Recent demand has been highly volatile: Period 42 saw a spike of 148 units (pre-Black Friday/Christmas ramp-up), while Period 43 dropped to 26 units. This variance is consistent with the late Q4 behavior observed in previous periods (e.g., the swing from 293 down to 96 in October). Given the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to maintain enough stock to cover these periodic surges without over-accumulating holding costs, which are equal to the profit ($1.00). Current on-hand is 65. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to capture the current late-year demand level (Average of P39-P43 is ~74 units), as the 40+ period historical average would be skewed by the summer lull. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the observed high volatility (standard deviation of the last 5 periods is ~48) to ensure a sufficient safety stock for potential pre-holiday spikes.

Carry-over insight: Late Q4 Demand Volatility: Demand remains erratic with significant swings (e.g., P42: 148, P43: 26). The mean demand for the last 5 weeks (P39-P43) has stabilized at approximately 74 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16) is approaching the mid-to-late December period. Historical demand for this 'Wrapover top/sweater' has been highly volatile in Q4, with recent periods showing a significant drop (P43 & P44 both at 26 units) following a late November spike (P42: 148 units). The 5-period average (P40-P44) is approximately 63 units, but the last two weeks suggest a cooling trend as the holidays approach. We currently have 48 units on hand. Given the 0-period lead time, we want to maintain a base stock that covers potential volatility but respects the recent lower demand observations. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (avg ~63) and a conservative sigma_hat will help manage the holding cost/stockout trade-off during this erratic transition period.

Carry-over insight: December demand deceleration detected: Late November/Early December demand has dropped significantly from the November average (~74) to 26 units in both P43 and P44.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-holiday/holiday week. Historical demand for this 'Wrapover top/sweater' has shown a significant deceleration starting in early December, stabilizing at exactly 26 units for the last three consecutive periods (P43, P44, P45). This represents a clear shift from the volatile November period which averaged around 74 units. Given this product is a knitwear item, demand typically trails off as the peak Autumn/Winter shopping season concludes and winter sales begin. I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period regime (N=3) to reflect this stabilized lower demand of 26. Lead time remains consistent at 0. With 38 units on hand and a mean demand of 26, the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to avoid excess holding costs, as we are entering a lower-demand seasonal phase.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime shift stabilized: Demand has remained constant at 26 units for three consecutive periods (P43-P45), down from the November average of ~74.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Women's Jersey Wrapover top) is in a clear seasonal deceleration phase as we conclude December. Demand has dropped from a November average of approx. 74 units to a stable level of exactly 26 units for three consecutive periods (P43-P45), followed by a further drop to 12 units in P46. This aligns with the seasonal lifecycle of autumn/winter knitwear exiting the peak holiday period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs in this decelerating regime, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the shift from the high-variance November period to the lower December levels. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the reduced volatility observed in the last four weeks compared to the extreme spikes seen in November (P42).

Carry-over insight: December demand deceleration stabilized: Mean demand for P43-P46 is ~22.5 units, confirming a significant drop from the November average (~74) as the product exits its peak season.
