The date is Feb 11, following New Year's resolutions but preceding the typical spring fitness surge. The product is a sports bra, which has relatively stable demand but can spike with fitness trends. Step 3: Inventory & OR Analysis: Current on-hand is 0. The OR baseline suggests 112 units based on historical mean.

Demand analysis: Historical demand samples (118, 136, 104, 95, 103) and the first period's actual demand (99) show a stable mean around 109 units. The product is a sports bra, which typically sees steady demand in early spring as customers prepare for fitness activities. 3. Inventory & Strategy: Current on-hand inventory is 13 units. Total demand for the current period is expected to be ~110 units. Since lead time is 0, orders arrive before demand resolution. To maintain a service level that reflects a 1:1 Profit-to-Holding-Cost ratio (critical fractile 0.5), we need to cover expected demand plus a small safety margin. 4. OR Comparison: The OR recommendation of 97 units, when added to the current 13 on-hand, provides 110 units for the period. Given the historical average is slightly higher (~109) and we saw 99 last week, 110 total units is a neutral-to-safe position.

The OR recommendation is 88 units. Applying base-stock logic: Target stock (for L=0) = mean demand + safety factor. Mean demand is ~114. OR's calculation seems conservative, likely due to the cap formula. Given that P2 saw a stockout with demand of 141, and current on-hand is low (26), I need to ensure we cover a high-demand scenario.

The date is June 24th, 2019.

Following the OR recommendation of 71 units would bring the available stock for Period 20 to 107 units (36 + 71). Given the historical mean (104.7) and the recent volatility, a stock level of 107 is slightly conservative but protects against holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0 makes the critical fractile 0.5, suggesting we should target the median demand).

Demand analysis: The historical demand shows a clear and sustained decline. Recent demand for the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is [25, 37, 35, 13, 25], averaging ~27 units per week. This is a significant drop from the OR agent's likely historical average (P1-P26 average is ~87). The OR recommendation of 58 is based on legacy high-demand volumes and doesn't fully capture the recent regime shift or the fact that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, yielding a critical fractile of 0.5 (meaning we should target the median demand). Strategy: Target a base stock level that covers the current period's demand (L=0). Using the recent average of ~27 plus a small safety buffer, a total availability of ~35-40 units is sufficient.

The OR recommendation is 88 units, which is calculated based on long-term historical averages (~80 units) and a safety stock factor. However, the carry-over insights correctly identified a significant downward regime shift starting in Period 21. While demand is recovering from its seasonal bottom, jumping immediately to 88 units (the OR recommendation) risks high holding costs (which are $1.0/unit) if the recovery is slow.

The OR recommendation of 77 units is based on the long-term historical mean (including the high Q1 demand), which is currently too high given the recent recovery pace.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The inventory for SKU 678687001 is currently 0 after a massive demand surge of 409 units in Period 45 (Dec 16). This surge followed a pre-holiday spike of 136 in Period 42, confirming that December is a high-volume period for this item. While the OR recommendation is 78 units based on historical averages, it fails to account for the extreme seasonality and the immediate need to restock to capture remaining holiday/year-end demand. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0, meaning an order placed now arrives in time for Period 46's demand resolution. Since Period 47 is the final period of the game, I need to balance capturing high demand with the risk of holding costs at the end. Given the previous surges (136 and 409), demand for Period 46 (Dec 23) is likely to be significant but perhaps slightly lower than the peak of Dec 16. I will order 150 units to meet this expected demand while remaining cautious about overstocking for the final period.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The current period is 47 (2019/12/30), representing the end-of-year peak for this sports bra. Historical data from December (P42, P45, P46) shows demand spikes of 136, 409, and 338 units, respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. The OR recommendation of 84 units is based on historical averages (mean 70.3, std dev 67.2), but it is heavily capped and fails to account for the extreme seasonal spikes observed in the last two weeks. Given that demand in the previous two weeks exceeded 300 units and the product has a high turnover during this seasonal peak, ordering only 84 units would result in a significant stockout. I will override the OR recommendation and order 300 units to capture the remaining end-of-year/New Year's resolution demand surge commonly associated with sports apparel, while balancing the risk of holding costs given we are at the end of the game (total periods: 47).",
