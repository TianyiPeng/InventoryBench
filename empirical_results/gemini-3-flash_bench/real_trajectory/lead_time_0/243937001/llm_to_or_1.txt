Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 243937001 (Women's Fine-knit socks). The current date is 2019-02-11. Historical demand data for the last 5 weeks shows a stable range between 70 and 91 units. Specifically: Jan 7 (70), Jan 14 (77), Jan 21 (91), Jan 28 (79), and Feb 4 (73). The mean demand across these 5 samples is 78.0, with a standard deviation of approximately 8.12. Given the product category (Socks) and the date (mid-February), there is no immediate reason to expect a massive seasonal spike or drop compared to January levels. The promised lead time (L) is 0. Since we have no observed history yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise, I will use 'default' for lead time (L=0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the most relevant recent five weeks of historical demand. This will result in an ordering policy that covers one period of demand (1+L=1) based on a mean of 78 and a standard deviation reflecting recent volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Straight Edge 5p Socks', a soft cotton blend fine-knit sock. This is a basic apparel item. Historical demand (P-5 to P-1) was: 70, 77, 91, 79, 73, and the actual demand for Period 1 was 54. The average demand across all 6 data points is 74. In Period 1, we ordered 92 units with an actual lead time of 0 (same period arrival), confirming the promised lead time of 0 is currently stable. On-hand inventory is 38. The OR backend uses a service level based on the Critical Ratio (19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for demand (mu_hat) to capture all seasonal context including the recent Period 1 dip, and 'default' for lead time and sigma, which works well for this stable category.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3 (2019/2/25), we are managing SKU 243937001 (Women's Fine-knit socks). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data + Period 1 and 2 confirms actual lead time is indeed 0. Demand for the last 7 weeks has been: 70, 77, 91, 79, 73 (pre-game) and 54, 72 (game history). The mean of all 7 samples is ~73.7, with a standard deviation of ~11.3. There is no significant evidence of a regime shift or seasonality shift yet, although demand in Period 1 was slightly lower than average. Since lead time is 0, we only need to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). I will use recent_N=7 to capture the full recent history for both mean and volatility to ensure a stable base stock level that targets high service levels given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). For SKU 243937001 (Women's cotton blend socks), historical demand samples (70, 77, 91, 79, 73) and recent game performance (54, 72, 48) show a mean of approximately 71.4 units/week. No significant seasonal trend or regime shift is detected in early March for this staple item. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (0) plus the review period (1). With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical ratio is 0.95, justifying a healthy safety stock. I will use recent_N=3 for demand parameters to capture the most recent game volatility while incorporating the prior samples through the default sigma calculation to ensure stability.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a pack of fine-knit cotton blend socks, a stable staple item. Historically, demand has shown a slight downward trend over the last 4 weeks (54, 72, 48, 38) compared to the initial seed data from Jan/Feb (avg ~78). The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (optimal q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), I will base the demand forecast on the most recent 5 samples (P1-P4 plus the last seed sample) to capture the current lower volume. I will use 'calculate' for lead time since the 0-period arrival is reliably demonstrated.

Daily Reward (R_t): $657.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '243937001' (Womens Socks) is transitioning from February into March/April. Historical demand initially averaged ~78 units (Jan-early Feb), but has dropped significantly in the last three periods (Period 3-5: 48, 38, 37) to an average of ~41. This suggests a post-winter seasonal decline for this specific cotton-blend sock SKU. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving immediately. I will adjust mu_hat using a recent_N window of 3 to capture this lower demand regime (avg ~41) and prevent overstocking, as holding costs ($1) relative to the current lower sales volume could erode profit. Sigma_hat is also updated using recent_N=3 to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 3: average weekly demand decreased from ~78 to ~41 (-47%) as the season moves into spring.

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, transitioning into mid-spring. The product (cotton blend socks) has shown a sustained decrease in demand compared to the initial January/February period. Demand over the last 4 weeks (Periods 3-6) has averaged 38.5 units (48, 38, 37, 31), confirming the regime shift noted in previous carry-over insights. Historically, lead time has remained stable at 0 periods (all orders from P1 to P6 arrived in the same period they were placed). Currently, on-hand inventory is 21 units with 0 in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (~95% quantile). I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this lower spring demand level and avoid overstocking while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the end-of-period demand resolution.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-04-01. The product (Fine-knit socks) has entered a lower demand regime since early March. Looking at the history from Period 3 onwards, demand values are [48, 38, 37, 31, 38], which averages approximately 38.4 units per period. This confirms the carry-over insight of a significant drop from the pre-period 3 average of ~75. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 7 concluded periods. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 13), so we need to order to cover upcoming demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable regime (Period 3-7). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that targets a high service level (profit/ratio approx 95%) while reflecting the lower current demand volume and volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/08 (Period 9). The SKU is 'Fine-knit socks'. Historically, demand dropped around Period 3 as winter transitioned to spring. Over the last 6 periods (Periods 3-8), demand has stabilized at a lower level with a mean of 37.6 units and a standard deviation of approximately 5.8 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with no lost or delayed shipments observed. I am using recent_N=6 to capture this lower spring demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock reacts to the current lower sales volume rather than the higher winter sales (70-90s). The stock and sales logic should target a safety stock appropriate for this 38-unit average demand.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a 5-pack of fine-knit cotton blend socks. Historically, demand was higher in January and February (avg ~78) but shifted to a lower regime starting in Period 3 (late February). In the last 7 periods (P3-P9), demand has stabilized at a lower level with a mean of 39.57 and standard deviation of 5.91. Specifically, recent demand is: 48, 38, 37, 31, 38, 34, 31. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use N=7 to capture this mid-spring demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that reflects the current lower consumption rate while avoiding excess holding costs for this stable, low-volatility period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the demand history, there have been two distinct phases: Phase 1 (Jan-Feb) with an average demand of ~78 units, and Phase 2 (March onwards) where demand dropped significantly. Within Phase 2, the most recent four periods (Periods 7-10) show a further decline with demand levels of 38, 34, 31, and 20 (average ~31). The Period 10 demand of 20 units is the lowest observed yet, suggesting a tapering off as late spring approaches for these cotton-blend socks. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 10 concluded cycles. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent downward trend in Phase 2 demand (approx. 31 units per period) to avoid overstocking and incurring unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this high-margin (95% critical ratio) item.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering further in late April (Periods 7-10): average demand dropped to ~31 units compared to the early Phase 2 average of ~41.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product (Cotton-blend socks) continues to show a declining demand trend as the weather warms. Historical demand has transitioned from ~75 units/week in February down to ~30-40 units in March, and most recently averaged ~22 units over the last three periods (P9: 31, P10: 20, P11: 17). This indicates a sustained tapering as we enter May. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all 11 concluded periods. Given the on-hand inventory of 27 units, which already covers more than one week of the current demand regime, the goal is to optimize parameters to avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent local demand average (~23 units), and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower-demand regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current spring levels rather than the higher winter volumes.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed through late April: Period 9-11 average dropped to ~23 units, representing a second downward shift from the ~41 average seen in March.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/06. The SKU is 'Fine-knit socks in a soft cotton blend,' which shows a clear downward seasonal demand trend as we move from winter into late spring/early summer. Previous carry-over insights identified demand shifts at Period 3 (avg ~41) and Period 9 (avg ~23). Analysis of recent demand (Periods 10-12: 20, 17, 19) confirms a sustained lower regime averaging 18.6 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' (which results in 0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (covering Periods 9-12) to capture this most recent stable, low-demand regime. This approach minimizes holding costs while maintaining sufficient service levels for the currently low sales volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late April/early May (Periods 9-12) at an average of ~19 units per week, down from the ~41 average seen in March.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 243937001 (Fine-knit cotton blend socks) has shown a clear downward trend from February peaks (~70 units/week) to a stabilized low-demand regime in late April/early May. The last four periods (Periods 10-13) show demand values of 20, 17, 19, and 17, averaging 18.25 units per week. This aligns with the seasonal shift towards warmer weather where demand for knit socks typically plateaus or declines. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order placed arriving in the same period. For Period 14, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this stabilized low-demand regime. This provides a more accurate mu_hat and sigma_hat than the full historical average, which is heavily skewed by the high demand in February.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit socks in a soft cotton blend,' which shows a clear downward seasonal trend as the weather warms up. Historical demand samples (before Period 1) averaged around 78 units. From Period 1-9, demand averaged ~42 units. Since Period 10, demand has dropped further and stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, from Period 10 to 14, demand was [20, 17, 19, 17, 21], resulting in an average of 18.8 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent low-demand regime (approximately 19 units/week) while ignoring the higher legacy demand levels from early spring and winter. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in early May (Periods 10-14) at an average of ~19 units per week, representing a clear seasonal baseline for late spring.

Daily Reward (R_t): $418.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we experienced a stockout (demand 33, sold 22) because the inventory level was insufficient to meet a sudden late-May spike. This increase from the previous ~19 units/week baseline to 33 units suggests a potential Memorial Day effect or early summer shift for socks. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent upward trend (P11-P15 demand: 17, 19, 17, 21, 33; average = 21.4). While the long-term spring baseline was ~19, the last period's demand was significantly higher (33), necessitating a more responsive forecast. Sigma_hat is also updated using the last 5 periods to account for this increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Slight upward shift in late May demand detected: Period 15 demand spiked to 33 units, pulling the 5-period average from ~19 to ~21 units (+10%).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we are moving into the summer season for lightweight socks. Recent demand has been volatile: 33 units in Period 15 (leading to a stockout) followed by 15 units in Period 16. The 5-period average (P12-P16) is 21 units. Although demand dipped last week, the stockout in P15 suggests we should maintain a base stock level that accounts for these intermittent spikes. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use N=5 for demand forecasting to capture the recent slight upward trend from the late April lows, while acknowledging the return to a lower volume in Period 16. This provides a balanced mu_hat of ~21 units and a sigma_hat that reflects recent variance.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' has shown a significant seasonal decline from an average of ~78 in February to a baseline of ~19 units in May. Recent demand in the last three periods (P15-P17) has been 33, 15, and 12 units (average 20). Period 15 was an outlier/minor spike, but the subsequent periods (15 and 12) confirm a return to the low-demand late-spring/early-summer regime. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). On-hand inventory is 21 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately one week of current demand levels. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the most recent stabilized regime (avg ~19.2) while acknowledging the slight uptick from Period 15 to ensure adequate stock without over-purchasing as we enter summer.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' has entered a low-volume stable regime consistent with summer (June). Over the last 4 periods (Periods 15-18), demand has been 33, 15, 12, and 9 units respectively. While Period 15 showed a spike (33), the subsequent three periods have shown a clear downward trend and stabilization at a very low level (average of 12 units for P16-P18). Historical promised and actual lead times have consistently been 0 periods, with no missing shipments. With 25 units on-hand and current demand averaging ~12 units, the system already has enough inventory for roughly 2 periods. To avoid overstocking during this low-demand summer phase, I will use a recent window (N=4) to capture the current mean and variance, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that reflects the current ~18 unit/period mean (heavily influenced by the P15 spike) while being responsive to the recent single-digit/low-teen arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline confirmed (June): average demand has dropped to ~12 units (Periods 16-18) following a late-May spike.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' (a cotton-blend sock) has reached a seasonal floor in June. Historical demand for the most recent June periods (17, 18, 19) shows a steep decline: 12, 9, and 4 units respectively. This aligns with the 'Summer demand baseline' insight noted in Period 19. Average demand over these last 3 periods is ~8.3 units. Given that cotton socks typically see their lowest demand during the hottest summer months (June/July), I will shift the \u03bc\u0302 calculation to focus on this most recent 3-period regime (N=3) to prevent over-ordering as demand bottoms out. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. The current on-hand inventory of 31 units is significantly above the expected demand for the upcoming period, so the OR backend should naturally minimize ordering to deplete excess stock while maintaining the optimal service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a seasonal low in late June: average demand for Periods 17-19 dropped to ~8 units, down from the ~12-15 unit range seen in early June.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' has consistently decreased as we move into summer, reaching a seasonal low in late June. Over the last four periods (Periods 17-20), demand has been 12, 9, 4, and 7 units respectively, resulting in a mean of 8.0 units per period. In Period 20, I intentionally ordered 0 units to reduce the ending on-hand inventory of 31 units down to 24 units. With current on-hand inventory (24) still significantly exceeding the current demand regime (avg 8.0, 1-period coverage target around 12-15 units), the OR engine should continue to minimize ordering. Since the pipeline is empty and on-hand is high, I will set L to 'calculate' (historically 0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent summer demand baseline. This will likely result in a 0-unit order again, allowing current stock to bleed down toward a more cost-effective level.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' is in a summer seasonal low. Current date is 2019-07-08. Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward trend from the year-start highs (~70-80 units) to a late-spring average (~19 units), and finally to a mid-summer baseline. Over the last five periods (P17-P21), demand has been 12, 9, 4, 7, and 9 units, resulting in an average of 8.2 units per week. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true. With an on-hand inventory of 15 units and the current demand average around 8-9 units, the existing stock covers approximately 1.8 weeks of supply. To maintain a high service level while avoiding excess holding costs (given the low summer demand), I will set lead time (L) to 0 and use a recent_N of 5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current summer demand regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, which is mid-summer. Customer demand for socks ('Straight Edge 5p Socks') has stabilized at a seasonal low. Over the last 4 periods (P19-P22), demand has been 4, 7, 9, and 11 units, respectively, averaging 7.75 units. This follows a significant decline from the spring peak. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations confirm that orders consistently arrive in the same period (L=0). Lead time is stable. Demand is currently in a stable low-regime. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this current summer baseline (approx. 8 units per week). This setting ensures we maintain enough stock to meet this low demand while minimizing holding costs on an item that is currently in its off-season.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 243937001 (Straight Edge 5p Socks) is currently in a stable low-demand summer phase. Recent weekly demand from Period 19 to 23 has been 4, 7, 9, 11, and 7 units, respectively. This averages to approximately 7.6 units per week. The summer demand baseline described in the carry-over insights (approx. 8-12 units) remains accurate. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 6 units and no units in transit, we need to order enough to satisfy demand for the upcoming period. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) captures the current 7.6 unit average, while sigma_hat (N=5) accounts for the slight variability observed in July. This conservative approach balances the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1) by aiming for a high service level without overstocking during the seasonal trough.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Fine-knit socks' has reached a seasonal low during the summer months (June and July). Over the last five periods (P20-P24), demand samples are [7, 9, 11, 7, 4], resulting in a mean of 7.6 units per week. The historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels are currently low (8 units on-hand), and since the product is low-value/high-profit (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), we should maintain a safety stock to prevent stockouts despite the declining demand trend. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable summer baseline of approximately 7-8 units per week while filtering out earlier, higher spring demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th (Period 26). The SKU is 'Fine-knit socks in a soft cotton blend,' which exhibit a clear seasonal decline from high demand in February-March to a sustained low throughout the summer. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Demand in the most recent regime (Periods 19-25) has averaged 6.14 units per week, with a very low standard deviation. The summer baseline (~6-8 units) appears stable. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current low-demand summer regime, setting L to calculated (which will be 0) to ensure the OR engine targets current-period demand plus a small safety buffer for this stable but low-volume period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline (July/August) confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~6 units (Periods 21-25) following the June trough of ~8 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019-08-12), and the product is women's socks, which is currently in a summer seasonal low. Demand has been extremely stable over the last 6 periods (Periods 21-26), averaging 7.5 units per week (9, 11, 7, 4, 5, 9). Inventory is low (on-hand: 3), but the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' ordering. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 6-period average to capture the current summer baseline, ensuring we maintain enough stock to meet demand while avoiding excessive holding costs as we transition towards late August.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/19, moving into late August. Demand for 'Fine-knit socks' has shown a notable uptick in the most recent period (Period 27 demand = 18), compared to the summer baseline of ~6 units established in July/August. This likely signals the beginning of 'back-to-school' or early autumn seasonal demand. Historical data from early 2019 showed much higher demand (initial samples ~78), suggesting a return to higher volume is expected. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 27, where we only sold 12 out of 18 units demanded. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this immediate upward trend (average of last 3 periods: 5, 9, 18 is 10.6, significantly higher than the summer average of 6) while allowing for further expansion. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early autumn demand shift detected: Period 27 demand spiked to 18 units, a 200% increase over the summer baseline of ~6 units, suggesting seasonal recovery for the socks category.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' is entering the late August/early September transition (Period 29, 2019/08/26). Following a summer baseline of ~6 units, demand spiked to 18 in Period 27 and remained elevated at 13 in Period 28. This signals the start of the autumn seasonal recovery as temperatures cool. The current on-hand inventory is 9 units. To capture this increasing demand trend and prevent stockouts (as seen in Period 27), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to reflect the shift from summer (6) to autumn (~15). Sigma_hat is set using the last 5 periods to account for the increased volatility during this transition. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal recovery confirmed in late August: Demand increased from a summer baseline of ~6 units to an average of ~15 units over the last two periods (P27-P28), a +150% shift.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. We are entering the autumn season for the 'Straight Edge 5p Socks'. Historical data from the beginning of the year (Feb/March) showed demand levels in the 40-70 unit range. Recent demand has confirmed a recovery from the summer low (avg ~6) to a new upward trend (P27-P29 demand: 18, 13, 14; avg ~15). Given this item's seasonal nature (socks/nightwear), I expect demand to continue climbing as cooler weather approaches. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this recent recovery, while maintaining a default lead time of 0 as established by history. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility observed during this transition phase.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' is entering a clear autumn recovery phase as of September. Period 30 saw a significant demand spike to 34 units, which is the highest since Period 15. The summer baseline of ~6 units has been replaced by an autumn upward trend: demand in the last four periods (P27-P30) has been 18, 13, 14, and 34, averaging ~20 units/period. The Period 30 spike specifically suggests that demand is accelerating into the colder months. To capture this shift while responding to the recent spike, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat (N=4 captures the start of the autumn shift) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal acceleration confirmed: Demand spiked to 34 units in Period 30, with the 4-period average (P27-P30) rising to ~20 units compared to the August average of ~15 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' is currently in a rapid seasonal upturn as we move into September (Autumn). Period 31 demand reached 39 units, marking the fourth consecutive period of increase (13 -> 14 -> 34 -> 39). The autumn seasonal acceleration is confirmed. Average demand over the last two periods (P30-P31) is 36.5 units, which is significantly higher than the August average of ~15 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid the stockouts seen in P30 and P31 where demand (34, 39) exceeded starting on-hand (20, 36), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 2-period average to capture this sharp upward trend, while increasing sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility during this transition. Using recent_N=2 for mu_hat projects a demand of ~36.5 units for the upcoming period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak acceleration: Demand in early September (P30-P31) has reached an average of ~36.5 units, a 140% increase over the August average (~15 units).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Fine-knit socks' is currently in a strong autumn seasonal acceleration phase. In Period 32 (mid-September), demand reached 53 units, following a trend of 34 and 39 units in the preceding two periods. The 'Autumn seasonal peak acceleration' insight accurately reflects this, showing a sharp rise from the August average of ~15 units to a recent 2-period average of 46 units. Given the date (2019/09/23) and the product type, we are entering the peak demand season for hosiery/socks as temperatures drop. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-velocity regime (avg: ~42, std: ~10). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in the history. The low on-hand inventory (4 units) necessitates an immediate replenishment order to meet the anticipated high demand for the coming week.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak confirmed: September demand (P30-P32) has averaged ~42 units, a 180% increase over the August average of ~15 units, indicating a high-velocity seasonal regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' has significantly surged as we move deeper into autumn (late September). The most recent period (P33) saw a demand of 93 units, which is a massive jump from the previous weeks (34, 39, 53). This indicates we are entering the peak seasonal phase for this category. My current on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in P33 (demand 93 vs total supply 59). To capture this growth and avoid further lost sales (which are high margin at $19 profit), I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to look at the most recent 4 periods (P30-P33) where the average is approx 55 units, and then applying an explicit adjustment to account for the clear upward trend which likely places current demand closer to the 80-90 unit range. I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high-velocity autumn regime while being sensitive to the volatility seen in the last period. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak acceleration confirmed: Period 33 demand spiked to 93 units, a 120% increase over the early September average of ~42 units, signaling a transition into a highest-velocity seasonal peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' has entered a highest-velocity seasonal peak as of October. Demand jumped from an average of ~40 in mid-September to 93 in Period 33 and 108 in Period 34. This aligns with the transition into autumn/winter, where socks and knitwear demand typically peaks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent arrivals. To capture this rapid acceleration and avoid stockouts (like those seen in Periods 30, 31, and 33), I am using N=3 for mu_hat to focus on the most recent high-demand signals (averaging ~85 units/week) and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. Setting L to calculate to maintain alignment with the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn peak confirmed: Demand has exceeded 90 units for two consecutive periods (P33-P34), establishing a new high-velocity regime (~100 units/week) compared to the early September average of ~42.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak autumn/winter season for socks. Demand has surged significantly over the last three periods: P33 (93), P34 (108), and P35 (113). The 3-period average is now ~105 units. With the date at October 14th, we are in the heart of the high-velocity season. Since the promised lead time is 0 and consistently arrives as 0, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual performance. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this new high-demand regime (~105 units) while filtering out the much lower summer/early autumn data. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility associated with higher volume, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $19 profit.

Carry-over insight: High-velocity autumn regime confirmed (October): Demand has exceeded 100 units for two consecutive periods (P34-P35), with a 3-period average of ~105 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 243937001 (Women's socks) has entered a sustained high-velocity autumn regime as of October. Demand in Period 36 was 126 units, with the last three periods (P34-P36) averaging ~115 units. We are currently stocked out (Ending inventory P36 = 0), and actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit and avoid lost sales during this peak, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-period regime (P34-P36) to capture this current high-demand level (~115 units/week). The 'calculated' lead time method is used as it accurately reflects the 0-day lead time observed throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: High-velocity autumn regime (Oct) confirmed: 3-period average (P34-P36) reached ~115 units, up from ~100 units previously recorded, indicating continued seasonal strength.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' is currently in a high-velocity autumn peak which has shown consistent growth over the last four periods (P34-P37: 108, 113, 126, 130). The average demand over these four periods is 119.25 units. There is a clear upward trend as October progresses, with Period 37 reaching a peak of 130 units. Given that we are now on October 28th and heading into November, demand is expected to remain high or continue increasing as winter approaches. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts which have occurred in 3 of the last 5 periods (P33, P36, P37), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4-period high-growth regime (N=4) to capture the ~120 units/week baseline, while using sigma_hat to provide a buffer for the observed volatility and potential for further spikes in demand.

Carry-over insight: High-velocity autumn regime (Late Oct) confirmed: Demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P34-P37), with the latest demand reaching 130 units. The current regime average is ~120 units/week, up from the early October average of ~105.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-velocity autumn/winter demand regime for socks (Date: Nov 4). Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demands were 108, 113, 126, 130, and 101. While P38 showed a slight dip to 101, the overall five-period average is approximately 116 units per week. Given the date (Early November), we anticipate demand to remain near this level or potentially increase further as the peak winter shopping season (Black Friday/Holiday) approaches. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To maintain sufficient stock and avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 36 and 37, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this high-velocity regime (~116 units/period). This provides a more responsive forecast than the full history while acknowledging the recent high volume. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this peak season.

Carry-over insight: High-velocity autumn/winter regime stabilized (Nov): 5-period average (P34-P38) is ~116 units, with demand consistently exceeding 100 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the high-velocity autumn/winter regime for socks. However, Period 39 demand (71) showed a significant drop from the previous 5-period average (~116). Period 38 demand was also lower at 101 compared to Period 37's 130. This suggests we may have passed the peak or are entering a temporary lull before holiday shopping spikes. With on-hand inventory at 65 and lead time consistently at 0, I will use a shorter window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this recent deceleration (Average P36-P39 \u2248 107) while maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for potential volatility as we approach the end of the year. Lead time remains pinned at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected in early November: Period 39 demand dropped to 71 units, bringing the 4-period average (P36-P39) to ~107 units, down from the October average of ~120.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 243937001 (Socks) is currently in a transitional phase as the high-velocity autumn peak (which peaked at ~130 units in late October) begins to decelerate in November. Period 39 demand was 71 units and Period 40 was 87 units, resulting in a 2-period average of 79 units. This is a significant drop from the October average of ~120 units. With Black Friday and the holiday season approaching in late November/December, I expects a potential secondary surge, but the immediate trend is downward. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (covering Periods 37-40) to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining enough coverage for the end-of-year peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to balance the high profit margin ($19) against holding costs ($1) during this shift in demand velocity.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration in November confirmed: Average weekly demand dropped to ~79 units (Periods 39-40), a ~34% decrease from the October high-velocity regime of ~120 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 243937001 (cotton blend socks) shows a clear deceleration from the October high-velocity peak (avg ~115-120) to a more moderate November regime. Over the last three periods (P39-P41), demand has been 71, 87, and 92 units, yielding a 3-period average of 83.3 units. This suggests demand is stabilizing at a level approximately 30% lower than the autumn peak but significantly higher than the spring/summer baseline. Given the upcoming transition into December (winter), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this stabilized 'late autumn' baseline while remaining responsive to potential holiday spikes. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility (std dev of 71, 87, 92). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late November (P39-P41) at an average of ~83 units/week, following the October high-velocity peak of ~120 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering December (Period 43). Recent demand for 'Fine-knit socks' has shown a significant spike (127 units in Period 42) following a stabilization around 83 units in late November. This aligns with seasonal expectations for socks & tights as holiday gifting and winter weather drive demand. However, Period 42 resulted in a stockout (sold 102 units of 127 demand), meaning on-hand inventory is currently 0. While the average of the last 4 periods (P39-P42) is 94.25 units, the jump to 127 indicates we are moving back into a high-velocity regime similar to the October peak (~115-120 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid further lost sales during the December peak, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the expected holiday demand (approx. 130 units) and set sigma_hat conservatively using the recent volatility to ensure high service levels during the stock-out recovery.

Carry-over insight: December seasonal demand spike detected: Period 42 demand reached 127 units (+53% vs P39-P41 average of 83), indicating a return to high-velocity regime for the holiday peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 occurs in early December (2019/12/9). Historically, December shows significant volatility: Period 42 spiked to 127 units (Pre-Christmas/Holiday demand), while Period 43 dropped to 65 units. This suggests the high-velocity holiday peak is underway but may fluctuate wildly due to shopping deadlines. The 2-period average (P42-P43) is 96 units, which is consistent with the late-autumn regime. L remains 0 based on consistent history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current holiday regime (avg ~88 units) while keeping volatility (sigma_hat) high to account for the potential of another pre-Christmas spike similar to Period 42. Setting mu_hat slightly above the simple average covers the high-service-level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: December holiday peak confirmed: High volatility observed (P42: 127, P43: 65), regime average stabilizing around 90-100 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), the peak holiday season for socks. Looking at the last three periods (P42-P44), demand has been 127, 65, and 84 units respectively, averaging 92 units per week. This aligns with the 'December holiday peak' insight of a regime between 90-100 units. The previous October/November data showed higher levels (110+ units), but current demand suggests a slightly lower but highly volatile baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period regime (P42-P44) to capture this holiday velocity. Sigma_hat is also calculated over these 3 periods to account for the high volatility (65 to 127 units), ensuring a sufficient service level for the remaining holiday weeks.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), which is right before Christmas. In previous periods (P42-P45), demand for 'Fine-knit socks' has been high and volatile, ranging from 65 to 127 units, with an average of approximately 93 units. Given the seasonal nature of socks as a gift category and the observation of the 'holiday peak' in carry-over insights, demand is expected to remain firm through the final week of the year but will likely drop significantly immediately after December 25th (starting Period 47). Since the simulation ends at Period 47, I need to ensure sufficient stock for the current period (P46) while avoiding excessive holding costs for the very final period. Lead time remains consistently at 0. I will use a 4-period mean (P42-P45) for mu_hat to capture the most recent holiday velocity (~93 units), but I will adjust sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility seen in the last few weeks (std dev is significant). L is set to default as the promised 0-day lead time is consistently met.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), which is typically the end of the peak holiday shopping season and the start of the post-holiday sales or winter clearance period. Looking at recent demand: P44 (84), P45 (96), and P46 (72), the 3-period average is approximately 84 units. This is slightly lower than the early December peak (which saw 127 in P42) but still robust. As we move into January, historical data from similar apparel cycles suggests demand will likely revert toward pre-holiday levels (~70-80 units) before potentially dipping further in late Q1. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure we have enough stock for the first week of January without over-committing during the post-holiday slowdown, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=5: Periods 42-46) which captures the holiday high and the start of the cooling phase, resulting in a mean of approximately 88.8 units. I will use N=5 for sigma to account for the high volatility seen in December (standard deviation of ~24). This conservative setting manages the risk of a sharp post-holiday demand drop while maintaining service levels for remaining winter interest.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration detected: Period 46 demand (72 units) is 25% lower than the P45 peak (96), suggesting a transition from the December holiday regime to a January baseline.
