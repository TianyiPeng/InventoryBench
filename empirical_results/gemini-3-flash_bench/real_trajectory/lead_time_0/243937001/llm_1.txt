February 14th is Valentine's Day, which typically doesn't cause a massive spike for basic socks, so I will base the forecast on the historical average. Promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now arrive during this period and are available to satisfy demand before the period conclude. To cover the current period's demand (approx 80 units) and maintain a small safety buffer against variability (bringing total stock to ~100), I need to order 100 units immediately since on-hand is currently 0.",

Period 15 saw a spike to 33, but Period 16 (last week) returned to a lower volume of 15.

The actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Inventory is currently at 20 units. To balance the risk of another spike (like Period 15) against the holding cost and recent low demand (Period 16), I will target an inventory level of 35 units.

  "rationale": "The product is 'Fine-knit socks in a soft cotton blend,' a seasonal staple for colder months. Calendar date is Dec 30, which is the post-Christmas/New Year transition period. Historically (from initial data provided in the prompt), demand in early January starts high (70, 77, 91). Recent demand has fluctuated between roughly 65 and 96 units, with the most recent Period 46 showing 72 units. While the late-October peak (~120+) has passed, the winter demand remains strong and aligns with the historical Jan levels of ~70-85 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 33. To cover expected demand of ~80 units for the coming period (balancing recent trends and historical Jan data) and maintain a small safety buffer, I will order 57 units to target a starting inventory of 90 (33 on-hand + 57 ordered).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand regime stabilized: Mid-to-late December demand (Periods 44-46) averaged 84 units, aligning with historical early-January levels (avg ~80). This confirms the transition from the holiday peak to the steady high-demand winter regime.",
