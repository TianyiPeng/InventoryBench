The average of the most recent two weeks is 64. Given the date (Feb 11), we are moving into the spring fashion season where demand for denim typically increases. Additionally, Valentine's Day falls within the upcoming period, which can drive retail spikes for fashion items. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive in the current period's resolution phase. To cover the current period's demand (projected ~75 units) and maintain a small safety buffer against the rising trend without over-ordering (given $1.00 holding cost), I will target an inventory level of approximately 85 units. Since on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0, the order amount is 85.",

For Period 2 (L=0), I need enough inventory to cover the current period's demand (approx 65-70 units) plus a safety buffer, as the lead time is short but demand is volatile.

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The item is a 'Push Up Jegging', a denim product. Current date is December 23 (Period 46). Historical lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Inventory logic: Demand peaked during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday period (P42: 183 units) and significantly dropped thereafter (P43: 35 units). Since then, demand has stabilized in a post-holiday range of 69-75 units (P44-P45). Given we are now in the week of Christmas, demand is likely to remain relatively stable or slightly taper off as the primary holiday shopping season concludes. With 11 units on-hand and an estimated demand of ~70 units for Period 46, an order of 70 units is placed to maintain a high service level while minimizing excess inventory heading into the likely lower-demand January period.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-holiday demand stabilization: After the late-November peak, demand has settled into a 65-75 unit range (avg 72 over P44-P45), significantly higher than the initial post-peak slump (P43: 35 units).",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU '658030006' is a ladies' 5-pocket jegging. We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30), which is the final week of the year and transition into the New Year. Historical data from early January 2019 (provided in setup) shows demand values of 39, 38, 59, 55, and 73. Recent demand has been volatile following the holiday spike: 183 (P42), 35 (P43), 69 (P44), 75 (P45), and 31 (P46). The low demand in P46 (Christmas week) is typical as retail slows immediately after the holiday peak. Looking forward to Jan-Feb, demand previously stabilized around 40-70 units. With 50 units on-hand and a confirmed lead time of 0, I will order enough to cover a projected demand of approximately 45-50 units while maintaining a small safety buffer for the start of the New Year, similar to the 2019 baseline.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-holiday volatility confirmed: Following the Dec 2 drop to 35 units, demand fluctuated (69, 75) before dropping to 31 units on Dec 23, mirroring the late-spring/early-summer distribution of 30-45 units.",
