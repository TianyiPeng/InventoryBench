The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available for this period's demand (Resolution Phase 2). With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to cover Period 1 demand immediately. Looking at the trend, 130-140 units is a reasonable expectation.

Demand history for the last three weeks (Periods 13, 14, 15) shows 138, 170, and 185 units, confirming the 'second spring surge' noted in Carry-over insights. Since we have consistently stocked out in the last two periods (ending inventory 0), the true demand is at least 170-185 and likely higher. Comparing current performance to a similar peak in early April (Period 8 demand was 220), I estimate current Period 16 demand to be around 170-190 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current on-hand is 0. To meet forecasted demand and provide a small buffer for variance, I will order 180 units. This avoids excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit) while maximizing profit capture ($4.0/unit).",

  "rationale": "The current date is December 30, 2019. Historical data and Carry-Over Insights indicate that the high-volume Autumn/Winter regime and holiday peaks have concluded. The most recent demand (Period 46: 83 units) shows a significant seasonal deceleration compared to the October/November average (~160-170). This SKU, a long-sleeved blouse, is likely entering a mid-winter low similar to (though perhaps not as extreme as) the July summer low, as consumer focus shifts away from late-autumn styles. I estimate demand for the coming week to be approximately 80 units. On-hand inventory is currently 47 units. Given the actual lead time is 0 periods and the holding cost is $1.0 vs. a profit of $4.0, maintaining lean inventory is prudent to avoid high carrying costs during this decelerated demand phase. I will order 43 units to target a total supply of 90 (forecast of 80 + a small safety buffer).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Mid-winter demand deceleration confirmed: Demand has dropped below 100 units (P46: 83) as the December holiday peak/stocking phase concludes, signaling a return to a lower baseline regime.",
