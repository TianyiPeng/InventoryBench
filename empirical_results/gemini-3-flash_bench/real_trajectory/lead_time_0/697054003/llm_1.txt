  "rationale": "Product Description: A women's everyday blouse ('Despacito'). Date context: Mid-February, post-Chinese New Year but pre-Spring peak in many retail regions. Historical data (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a declining trend from a high of 186 down to roughly 86-89 in the most recent weeks. This suggests a post-holiday normalization or a clearing of initial stock. Recent demand (Feb 4) was 89. Demand analysis: The last two weeks (86, 89) suggest a stable baseline around 90 units per week. Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period and be available for this period's demand. Inventory status: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. Strategy: Order enough to cover the expected immediate demand (target 100 to allow for slight variance/safety stock) plus a buffer. Since Lead Time = 0, the order arrives and is consumed in the same period. I will target a stock level of 100 units to meet the current regime's expected demand.",

However, recent actual demand shows 79 (P1) and 130 (P2). P2's high demand (130) resulted in a stockout (sold 101, needed 130), meaning there is unmet demand. Calendar analysis: late February often sees a transition toward spring collections. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals in P1 and P2 confirm actual lead time is indeed 0 (same-period arrival). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. To meet demand for Period 3, I need to order enough to cover the expected demand. Given the stockout in P2 (demand 130) and the upward trend from P1 to P2, I will forecast P3 demand at approximately 130-140 units. Since lead time is 0, the order placed now will arrive and be available for this period's demand.

Historical Analysis: Demand from samples (Jan/early Feb) ranged from 86-186. Recent demand (P1: 79, P2: 130, P3: 150) shows a steady upward trend. Note that in P2 and P3, sales were capped by stockouts (sold 101/demand 130 and sold 140/demand 150), meaning true demand is likely higher than the 'sold' units. Lead Time: Consistently '0' for P1, P2, and P3, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Target: Given the stockout in P3 (demand 150+) and the seasonally favorable timing (Early March), I estimate Period 4 demand to be between 160-180. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the penalty for overstocking equals the penalty for stocking out, so I will target a slightly aggressive stock level to capture growth.
