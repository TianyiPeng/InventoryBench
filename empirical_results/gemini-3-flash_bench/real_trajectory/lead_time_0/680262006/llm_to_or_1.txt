Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 680262006 (Supreme Tights). Historically, demand has shown a clear upward trend from 52 units (Jan 07) to 141 units (Jan 28), then slightly dipping to 125 (Feb 04). The product is 'Ladies H&M Sport' tights, which likely sees sustained demand during the winter/spring fitness season (New Year resolutions continuing through Feb). The average demand over the 5 known samples is 102 units, but the recent three samples (123, 141, 125) average 129.6. Given the growth trend from early January, 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) will better reflect the current regime than the full history. The promised lead time is 0; I will start with 'default' L until empirical evidence suggests a logistics delay.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the SKU 680262006 (SUPREME tights), the historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 52, 69, 123, 141 (end of Jan), and 125 (start of Feb). The most recent period (Period 1) had a demand of 127. This suggests a demand regime shift occurring around late January, likely due to increased fitness activity in the new year. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time was 0), confirming reliability for now. Current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). Given the consistent higher demand over the last 3 samples (141, 125, 127), I will use N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this 'high' regime (averaging ~131 per period). Since L=0, mu_hat should target (1+0) * 131 = 131 units.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. We are looking at a sports leggings SKU (SUPREME tights). Historical samples (Jan 7 - Feb 4) showed an upward trend: 52, 69, 123, 141, 125. In the actual game periods, Period 1 (Feb 11) saw 127 demand and Period 2 (Feb 18) saw 165 demand. This indicates a sustained higher demand regime likely driven by post-New Year fitness habits or a specific seasonal push for sportswear. The lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use the last 3 samples (including the game periods) to estimate mean and volatility, as they represent the current 'high' demand phase better than the early Jan data. N=3 is chosen because the jump from sub-100 to the 120-160 range happened roughly 3-4 periods ago.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from an average of ~60 in early Jan to ~130+ starting late Jan, peaking at 165 in Period 2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is SUPREME sports tights. Demand has significantly increased from the initial samples (average ~99 across all history) to a recent high-demand regime (last 3 periods average: [127, 165, 168] = 153.3). This lines up with the onset of spring and increased fitness activity. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, ensuring same-period arrival. In Period 2 and 3, demand (165, 168) exceeded supply, resulting in lost sales. To maximize profit and meet this higher demand (mu_hat), I will set N=3 to capture the recent regime more accurately. Given the volatility and stockouts, I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to provide a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: Average weekly demand increased from approx 60 units (Jan) to 153 units (Feb) as of Period 4, likely driven by spring fitness seasonality.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/3/11. The product is sports tights, which typically see high demand during the spring 'fitness' season. Historical demand grew from ~60 in Jan to a consistent high in Feb/March: P1(127), P2(165), P3(168), P4(146). The average over these last 4 periods is 151.5. On-hand inventory is very low (8 units). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (orders consistently arrive in the same period they are placed). To capture the current sustained high-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using a limited window ensures the OR backend reacts to the Feb-March shift rather than the lower Jan figures.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'SUPREME tights' is currently experiencing high demand likely associated with spring fitness seasonality. Looking at the history since early February (Period 1-5), demand values have been [127, 165, 168, 146, 127], with an average of approximately 146.6 units. The most recent demand (127) suggests a slight cooling from the peak late February volatility, but remain significantly higher than the initial January data (avg ~60). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1 through 5. Because the profit ($1) equals the holding cost ($1), the OR engine's critical ratio q = 0.5, which sets the base stock at the median of the demand distribution. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture this February/March regime while ignoring the low-demand January data, ensuring the base stock reacts to the current seasonal level (approx 147 units per period).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-25 (Period 7). The product is 'SUPREME tights', a spring fitness category. In Jan, demand was low (~60-70). Since mid-Feb (Period 1), demand shifted to a higher regime: P1=127, P2=165, P3=168, P4=146, P5=127, P6=131. The average over these 6 periods is ~144. Performance has stabilized between 127 and 168. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this entire high-demand regime, as it represents the current 'spring fitness' phase. Predicted actual lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed and arrived in the same period for all 6 active periods). Profit and Holding cost are both $1.0, resulting in a target service level of 0.5 (q = 1 / (1+1)). This means the base stock policy will aim for the median demand. With a lead time of 0, the engine needs to cover Period 7 demand (current decision phase). Using recent_N=6 for both mu and sigma ensures we ignore the low-volume Jan data and focus on the current sustained regime.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/4/01 (Period 8). The product is 'SUPREME tights', which saw a demand spike in late January/early February (the spring fitness season). However, demand has since stabilized. The average demand over the last 4 periods (Periods 4-7) is 137 units per period (146, 127, 131, 144). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, ensuring same-period arrivals. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in transit. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q = 0.5) implies the base stock should roughly equal the expected demand over the lead + review period (1+L = 1 period). I will use the recent 4 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stable post-peak demand regime, ensuring we cover the expected demand of ~137-140 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized following the spring fitness spike; average demand for Period 4-7 is 137 units vs the earlier peak of 165.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Historical demand for the 'SUPREME tights' shows a significant recent spike in Period 8 (178 units) compared to the previous stabilization at ~137 units. This corresponds with early April, a period typically associated with increased fitness activity. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all history (Periodic conclude shows same-period arrivals). With profit and holding cost equal ($1.0), the backend's critical ratio q = 0.5, directing the policy toward the median demand. To react to the recent spike while acknowledging the stable Feb-Mar base, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering Periods 4-8) to capture the trend of 146, 127, 131, 144, 178 (avg ~145). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=5 to properly account for the increase in volatility observed at the start of April.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in early April (Period 8 demand 178 vs prev 4-period avg 137).

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant shift from January (~60) to a higher stability zone starting in February. Over the last 9 periods (Feb 11 - April 8), demand has averaged 146.8 units with a peak of 178 in Period 8. The most recent demand (Period 9) was 136. Inventory is currently low (10 units) and lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same week. To capture the current stabilized demand level which remains significantly higher than the initial January data, I am using a recent window of N=9 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window focuses solely on the post-January regime. Since lead time is consistently 0, the backend will calculate base_stock as (1+0) * mean + z * sqrt(1+0) * std. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand to minimize total costs, though the OR engine's cap provides some protection against stockouts.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22nd. Demand has significantly decelerated in Period 10 to 81 units, down from the 130-140 average observed in March/early April. This decline follows the typical post-Easter/spring fitness spike drop-off. Current on-hand inventory is 66 units. I need to adjust mu_hat downward to reflect this new demand level to avoid overstocking, as holding costs are equal to profit ($1.00). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent slowdown more heavily while still accounting for the higher demand from Period 8 and 9 to ensure we don't stock out if demand rebounds slightly. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected starting mid-April (Period 10 demand drop to 81, a ~40% decrease from the previous 4-period average of ~148).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'SUPREME tights' (H&M Sport) has significantly decelerated over the last two periods (81 and 83 units), compared to the previous March/early-April average of ~148. This suggests the spring fitness peak has subsided. As we move into May, demand is likely to remain at this lower level or stabilize. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (which equal profit at $1/unit), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward shift (avg of ~100 units/period). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current variability in this new regime while maintaining a responsive service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed through late April: Avg demand dropped from ~150 (spring peak) to ~82 (Periods 10-11), a decrease of approx 45%.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'SUPREME tights' has entered a new lower-demand regime following the spring fitness peak. Demand for the last three periods (P10-P12) has been 81, 83, and 97, averaging approximately 87 units per week. This is a significant drop from the ~140-150 unit average observed in March and early April. Transitioning into May, I expect this stabilized lower demand to continue. On-hand inventory is currently very low (3 units). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To align with this new regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=3 (the length of the new regime) to quickly adjust the base stock downward and avoid excessive holding costs, as Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, requiring a 50% service level balanced by the OR backend.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear regime shift: following a spring peak (averaging ~150 units in March/early April), demand has decelerated significantly since mid-April (Period 10), dropping to an average of ~84 units over the last four periods (81, 83, 97, 74). The most recent demand (Period 13) was 74, suggesting a continuing lower-demand trend as the spring athletics season fades. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Inventory metrics show an on-hand balance of 13 units. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the current lower demand level (~84 units), which helps prevent overstocking and high holding costs in this decelerating regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical data Shows a clear demand regime shift that occurred in Mid-April (Period 10). Before the shift (Periods 4-9), demand averaged ~148 units. Since Period 10, demand has stabilized at a lower level: the average demand for the last five periods (P10-P14) is 83.6 units (81, 83, 97, 74, 83). The product is 'SUPREME tights', which saw a spring fitness spike that is now subsiding as we move into late May. Pipeline and on-hand inventory are very low (On-hand: 1, In-transit: 0), so we must order to meet this new demand level. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a 5-period window (recent_N where N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'post-peak' demand regime accurately while minimizing the influence of the earlier high-demand spring period.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stability confirmed: From Period 10 to 14 (late April to mid-May), demand has stabilized at an average of 83.6 units, representating a consistent ~45% reduction from the spring peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical data shows that demand for SUPREME tights stabilized after the spring fitness peak (Jan\u2013April). Specifically, from Period 10 to 15 (covering mid-April to late May), demand has fluctuated within a tight range of 74 to 97 units, with a mean of 82.16 units. The most recent period (P15) saw a demand of 75. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with orders arriving the same period they are placed. Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the OR backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median demand. To capture this stabilized post-peak regime, I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 (covering the stable period from P10-P15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the high-volatility spring peak data and ensure the order quantity reflects current late-spring demand levels.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. This product (SUPREME tights) experienced a significant demand drop in early April (Period 10) and had stabilized around 83 units for several weeks. However, Period 16 (last week) saw a sharp decline to 40 units, which is a second significant step down (approx 50% drop from the already reduced average). Looking at the June date, we are heading into summer where full-length sports tights often see a seasonal lull in demand compared to the spring fitness rush. Since high volatility is present and the most recent data point is less than half the previous mean, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to weigh the recent slowdown more heavily without overreacting solely to one week of data. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Second demand deceleration detected Period 16 (2019/5/27): Demand dropped to 40 units, a ~50% decrease from the secondary baseline of ~83 units established in Periods 10-15.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262006 (SUPREME tights) shows a significant and sustained demand drop. We are now in June, and demand has fallen from a spring peak of ~150 to a late-spring baseline of ~83 (Periods 10-15), and has now dropped further to an average of 34.5 units over the last two periods (40 in P16 and 29 in P17). This aligns with a typical post-spring fitness seasonal decline for sports tights. My strategy is to adjust \u03bc\u0302 to reflect this new lower demand regime to prevent excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit: $1.0/$1.0). I will use the last 3 periods (N=3) to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, which captures the shift starting at Period 16 while providing a small buffer. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Second demand deceleration confirmed: Demand dropped significantly starting Period 16 (avg ~35 units), a ~58% decrease from the previous stabilized level of ~83 units (Periods 10-15).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'SUPREME tights' is experiencing a sustained reduction in demand, likely due to the post-spring fitness period and late-June seasonality. Periods 16-18 show demand values of 40, 29, and 29, confirming the second deceleration described in the carry-over insights. The average demand for these last three periods is approximately 32.7 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful deliveries. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, making the base stock equivalent to the mean demand for the period plus lead time. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this new, lower demand regime (avg ~33) while allowing for slight volatility. This strategy aims to minimize ending inventory and associated holding costs as interest in spring/early summer sportswear fades.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'SUPREME tights' is experiencing a sustained low-demand regime after a significant spring peak. We observed a second demand deceleration starting in late May (Period 16). For the last four periods (P16-P19), the demand has been 40, 29, 29, and 24, resulting in a mean of 30.5 units and a standard deviation of 6.7 units. This represents a distinct regime compared to the previous stabilized level of ~83 units. Since the lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, I will set L to 'default' (promised). To align the OR backend with this new reality, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which focuses on this most recent four-period low-demand cluster. This will lower the base stock level to prevent excessive inventory holding costs during what appears to be a summer seasonal dip.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime shift confirmed (Summer lower-bound): From Period 16-19, demand has further stabilized at an average of 30.5 units, a 63% reduction from the mid-spring 'intermediate' level and an 80% reduction from the early spring peak.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. This SKU (Supreme Sports Tights) has shown a clear seasonal decline from a spring peak (~150 units) to a current summer low. In the most recent period (Period 20), demand dropped further to 10 units, below the 4-period average of 30.5 units established from Period 16-19. Given the Profit/Holding ratio of 1.0/1.0, the target service level is 50%, which naturally reduces stock to minimize holding costs as demand softens. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N (N=5) to capture the established summer baseline while acknowledging the most recent low data point, and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the current lower volatility level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Summer Trough): Demand for Periods 16-20 has averaged 26.4 units, dropping significantly from the previous baseline. Period 20 recorded the lowest demand of 10 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a 'Summer Trough' demand regime. As of Period 22 (2019/7/8), demand has consistently trended downward and stabilized at a low level. Over the last six periods (Periods 16-21), demand has been 40, 29, 29, 24, 10, and 20 respectively, resulting in a mean of 25.33 units. This is a significant drop from early spring peaks. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently confirm a 0-period lead time. With profit ($1.0) equal to holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, roughly targeting the median demand. I am using recent_N=6 to capture this lower summer demand regime, ensuring the OR backend uses the current mean and volatility to set a safe base stock without over-ordering into late summer, while maintaining enough stock (On-hand is currently 7) to meet expected demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-July (Period 23). The product, SUPREME sport tights, has seen a significant seasonal decline from its spring fitness peak (~150 units/week) to a summer trough. For the last 7 periods (Periods 16-22), demand has averaged 23.3 units, with the most recent two weeks showing very low activity (20 and 11 units). The carry-over insights confirm this 'Summer Trough' regime. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. This means the OR backend targets the median demand, and we should be very careful not to over-order and incur high holding costs during this low-demand period. I will use the last 7 periods (from Period 16 onwards) to set our demand parameters, as this represents the current stagnant summer regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'SUPREME tights' has stabilized at a very low summer trough level. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 19-23), demand has been 24, 10, 20, 11, and 9 units, averaging 14.8 units. The most recent three periods (21-23) show an even lower average of 13.3 units. Given that the product is a sports tight and it is mid-July (2019/7/22), we are in the deepest part of the summer lull. On-hand inventory is currently 15, which already covers the most recent average weekly demand. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid unnecessary holding costs (which match the profit per unit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this low-demand regime without being overly reactive to the single-digit outliers of the last two weeks, ensuring the base stock level remains lean yet safe.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262006 (Supreme Tights) is currently in a deep summer trough. Demand has consistently declined from its spring peak (~150 units) and has further decelerated over the last 9 periods (Period 16-24), averaging 19.7 units. The most recent demand samples are even lower: 10, 20, 11, 9, 6 (Period 20-24, average 11.2). Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the system must be very lean to avoid carrying excess stock during this low-demand phase. I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent extreme lows (average ~11), preventing the backend from over-ordering based on the slightly higher averages from June.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Summer Trough intensification): Average demand for Periods 20-24 dropped to 11.2 units, a 57% decrease from the early-summer baseline of ~26 units established in Periods 16-20.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262006 (SUPREME tights) is currently in a deep summer trough. The date is August 5th, which traditionally marks the end of summer sales and precedes the 'Back to School' or 'Fall Fitness' transition in later August/September. Demand has been extremely low for the past 6 periods (Periods 20-25), with an average of 11.2 units (samples: 10, 20, 11, 9, 6, 11). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. While we expect a shift back toward higher demand as fall approaches, there is no statistical evidence in the demand history yet to justify an 'explicit' forecast increase. Therefore, I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime while maintaining a small buffer. Lead time remains at 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a deep summer trough (low demand period for sports tights). The most recent demand regime (Periods 20-26) shows an average demand of approximately 8.7 units (10, 20, 11, 9, 6, 11, 4). The last five periods (22-26) show even lower stability at around 8.2 units, with the most recent demand being only 4 units. Given that on-hand inventory is 8 units and there is no in-transit stock, and the lead time remains consistently 0, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 samples (N=7) to capture this current low-demand baseline. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect the reduced volatility in this period. This approach ensures we don't over-order during the seasonal lull while maintaining enough stock for the current low-demand pace.

Carry-over insight: Summer Trough stability confirmed (Periods 20-26): Demand has stabilized further at an average of ~8.7 units, reflecting a post-July intensification of the seasonal low.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-19, deep in the summer season for 'Supreme Tights' (fast-drying functional vest/leggings). Historical demand confirms a sustained 'Summer Trough' since Period 20 (late June). Specifically, the last 8 periods (P20-P27) show an average demand of 10.5 units with low volatility, compared to the spring peak of ~150. Period 27 demand was 13 units, causing a stockout as available inventory (11 units) was insufficient. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and maintain service levels during this low-demand stability phase, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current stable regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~11 units plus a small safety buffer, minimizing holding costs while preventing further stockouts.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/26. We are in the 'Summer Trough' period for sports tights, characterized by very low and stable demand. Since Period 20, demand has consistently remained in the single digits or low teens, with a recent average of approximately 8 units per period (Periods 20-28 avg: 10 units, Periods 24-28 avg: 8 units). On-hand inventory is 5 units, and in-transit is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to slightly above the recent moving average to provide a small buffer for slight volatility (e.g., the 13 units seen in P27), while keeping sigma_hat low to reflect the reduced variance of this low-demand regime. Using recent_N with N=5 captures the most recent stability since late July.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Historically, this SKU (Supreme tights) follows a clear seasonal pattern: high demand in spring (Feb-Apr, ~150 units), stabilizing at an intermediate level in May (~80 units), and hitting a summer trough from June through August (~8-11 units). Since late July (Period 24), demand has remained very low, averaging approx 7.5 units over the last 6 periods. As we enter September, we may start to see a minor uptick for autumn fitness, but there is no evidence of this yet in the data. With Profit=Holding=1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning we should aim to hold exactly enough for the expected demand. I will use the most recent 10 periods (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable 'summer trough' regime while remaining responsive to any early September shifts. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262006 (sports tights) is currently in a sustained 'Summer Trough' demand regime. Since Period 20, weekly demand has consistently remained in the single digits or low teens, with an average of approximately 8.3 units over the last 11 periods (P20-P30). The most recent demand was 11 units. There is no evidence of a 'Back to School' or 'Fall Fitness' surge yet (September 9th date). The inventory currently sits at 0 on-hand. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level (q = p/(p+h)) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use the last 11 periods (N=11) to capture this stable low-demand era (P20-P30), which provides a mu_hat of approx 8.3 per period (16.6 for 1+L) and appropriately scaled sigma_hat.

Since demand is stable at this low level, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the contemporary low-demand environment and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for these low volumes.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is sports tights, which experienced a significant peak in spring (Feb-April) followed by a steady decline through summer. Since Period 20 (late June), demand has entered a 'Summer Trough' regime, stabilizing at a very low level. For the last 13 periods (Period 20 to 32), the average demand is approximately 8.5 units. The most recent 5 periods (Periods 28-32) show an average demand of 6.6 units, indicating the trough persists as we transition into early autumn. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a service level for this low-demand phase, I will use a recent_N window (N=13) for mu_hat to capture this entire summer/post-summer baseline, and a shorter window (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect the current low volatility. This balances historical context with current stability.

Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern: high demand in Feb/Mar (avg ~140-150), followed by a step-down in May (avg ~80), and a deep trough starting in June through September. For the last 14 periods (Periods 20-33), demand has been extremely low and stable, averaging 8.7 units per period. The recent 5 periods (29-33) show demand of 5, 11, 8, 3, and 8 (mean 7.0). As we are moving out of September, there might be a slight uptick for 'Back to Sport' autumn demand, but the data does not yet show a sustained regime shift. Therefore, I will use a recent_N method with N=14 to capture the stable low-demand regime established since June, while maintaining a low lead time of 0 as consistently observed.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Historical demand shows the product (Supreme Tights) underwent several significant regime shifts throughout the year, with a massive spring peak (avg ~153 units) followed by a gradual decline and a 'Summer Trough' stabilization. Since Period 27 (mid-August), demand has been exceptionally stable at an average of approximately 7.1 units per period (Periods 27-34). Specifically, the last four periods show demand of [8, 3, 8, 8], which averages 6.75 units. There is no evidence of an autumn recovery yet, but given the stability of the current low-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the stabilized summer/early-autumn baseline. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the backend will naturally target using the base stock formula.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand for 'SUPREME tights' has remained in a stable 'Summer Trough' regime since late July (Period 27), with occasional minor fluctuations. Over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), demand has averaged 6.6 units, with a maximum of 11 and a minimum of 3. There is no evidence yet of an autumn recovery for this specific SKU. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. With on-hand inventory at 5 units and profit equal to holding cost (z-score will target the 50th percentile), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average (~6.6) and use a recent window for sigma to account for the current low volatility. This prevents overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the observed demand range.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product is SUPREME tights (sports leggings), which typically see high demand in the spring fitness season (Feb-April) and a significant trough in the summer months. Historical demand confirms this pattern: demand peaked at ~165 in spring, dropped to ~83 in early summer, and intensified its trough to ~8.7 units from Period 20 (late June) through Period 36 (mid-October). Period 36 demand was 8, consistent with the low-demand stability observed since late July. While autumn gym-based fitness usually triggers a small secondary peak, there is no evidence of this starting in the historical data yet. I will maintain the current low-demand parameters (base_stock calculation for L=0) using a window that covers the current stable period (N=10) to avoid reacting to minor weekly noise while ensuring we meet the consistent ~8 unit demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Summer Trough' period (roughly Periods 20-37) has consistently remained low. The average demand over the last 10 periods (N=10, Periods 28-37) is 6.7 units, and over the last 5 periods (Periods 33-37) is 7.4 units. While the carry-over insight from Period 27 noted a stabilization around 8.7 units, recent data slightly fluctuates around this level. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. As we are moving into late autumn/winter, there is no immediate indication of a seasonal spike for 'Supreme Trights/Sport' yet (which saw its primary peak in Feb/Mar). I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime, selecting N=10 to balance recent trends with enough variance data.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'SUPREME tights', a fitness-related item. Current date is November 4, 2019. Historically, demand for this SKU saw a major peak in early spring (Feb-Apr) followed by a gradual decline and a very low 'Summer Trough' starting in July. Since late August (Period 29), demand has stabilized at a very low level. Looking at the last 10 periods (Period 29-38), the average demand is 7.1 units. Specifically, for the last 5 periods (Period 34-38), the average is 7.6 units. There is no evidence of a late-autumn or pre-holiday spike yet, which aligns with typical gym-wear seasonality where the main surge occurs with New Year's resolutions/early spring. Inventory is currently at 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this low-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current stable mean of ~7 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262006 (Supreme Tights) has been in a sustained low-demand period (Summer Trough) since August. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P30-P39), demand has averaged 7.1 units per week with a standard deviation of approximately 2.8. The current date is November 11, which marks the beginning of the late autumn/winter season. While there is no historical data yet to confirm a winter athletics or 'Black Friday' spike for this specific SKU, demand has slightly ticked up from the August lows (averaging ~8-10 in Oct/Nov compared to ~5 in Aug). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect this current stable baseline. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1 each), the OR backend will target a 50% service level plus the safety stock buffer. Maintaining a safety stock based on recent volatility (sigma_hat) is prudent to capture any early winter demand shifts.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is SUPREME tights (fitness apparel). Since Period 27 (mid-August), demand has been extremely stable in a 'Summer/Autumn Trough' regime. Reviewing the last 10 periods (P31-P40), demand has averaged 6.6 units (range 3-10). Currently, there is no evidence of a pre-holiday or winter spike for this specific SKU, which saw its primary peak in spring (Feb-April). On-hand inventory is 4, and lead time is consistently 0. Given the low demand and 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, the base stock should target approximately 7-8 units to cover the current period's expected demand while minimizing stockout risk for the weekly variation (std dev is approx 2.5). Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat captures this current low-demand stability.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'SUPREME tights', a fitness item. We are currently in late November (Period 42: 2019/11/25). Historically, demand for this SKU showed a massive peak in early spring (Feb-April) around 130-160 units, then stabilized around 80 in mid-spring, and collapsed into a summer trough of roughly 10 units. From Period 20 to Period 41, demand has been extremely low and relatively stable, with a mean of approx 7 units. While Black Friday and the holiday season are approaching, this specific SKU (ladies' sports tights) has not yet shown any preemptive seasonal lift in the November data (Periods 39-41 demand: 3, 4, 6). Therefore, I will maintain the base stock level around the current stable mean to avoid high holding costs, but I'll use a slightly longer window (recent_N = 10) for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand baseline (~7.3 units) while ignoring the spring peaks. I'll use default lead time (0) as it has been consistent throughout the history.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is H&M Sport 'SUPREME tights'. Historical data in Jan/Feb showed demand between 130-165 (Spring fitness spike). Demand then stabilized and dropped significantly through Summer. Period 42 (Ending Nov 25) showed a sudden spike to 30 units (from a trailing average of ~6). This aligns with 'Black Friday' (Nov 29, 2019) and the start of the holiday shopping season. Given the product category (Sport Tights), we can anticipate a 'New Year, New Me' fitness resolution spike beginning in late December/early January. Since we are at Period 43 (Dec 2), and the trailing 3-week average jumped from ~5 to 13.3 due to the BF spike, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the upward momentum while acknowledging the likely volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike detected (Period 42: 30 units), coinciding with Black Friday/Holiday season onset. This marks an exit from the 'Summer/Autumn Trough' (avg ~8) into a holiday/pre-New Year regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (2019/12/9). The previous period (Period 42) showed a demand spike to 30 units, coinciding with Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. Period 43 demand dropped back to 3, but this is likely due to the post-Cyber Monday lull before the Christmas/Holiday peak typically escalates mid-December. Since the product is 'SUPREME tights' (H&M Sport), fitness/New Year's resolution demand is expected to surge shortly (as seen in early 2019 samples). I will use an explicit forecast to bridge the gap between the summer trough (avg ~8) and the anticipated holiday/fitness ramp-up. Given Period 42 hit 30, and we are moving into the peak holiday shopping weeks, I'll set mu_hat based on an expected average of 30 units per period to ensure sufficient stock for potential surges, while keeping sigma_hat slightly elevated to handle the volatility observed during transitions.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Fitness ramp-up detected: Demand spiked to 30 units in Period 42 (Black Friday week). Expecting transition from 'Summer Trough' (avg ~8) to a higher holiday/New Year baseline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for the 'SUPREME tights' product has shown extreme seasonality over the year, peaking at ~165 in early spring and hitting a trough of ~8 in summer/autumn. We recently observed a holiday spike of 30 units (Period 42), followed by a cooling in Periods 43 (3) and 44 (4). However, the carry-over insights and product category (sport tights) suggest we are entering the 'New Year Fitness' ramp-up phase, which historically saw demand jump from ~50-60 in early January to over 120+ by mid-February. Lead time remains stable at 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 26. To prepare for the imminent January ramp-up, I will use an explicit forecast that anticipates the pre-New Year stocking. Based on the start of the previous year's data (Jan 7: 52, Jan 14: 69), I expect demand to rise toward the 50-60 range very soon. Setting mu_hat to 65 to ensure sufficient stock for the transition from December to January, and explicit sigma_hat to 20 to account for spike volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), leading into the final week of December. Historical evidence from early Jan 2019 (History Samples: Jan 7 = 52, Jan 14 = 69, Jan 21 = 123) suggests a very strong demand ramp-up for fitness apparel (SUPREME tights) immediately following New Year's Day. While actual demand for the last few weeks has been low (Periods 43-45: 3, 4, 6 units), the spike to 30 units on Black Friday (Period 42) and the imminent 'New Year, New Me' fitness surge require a proactive increase in inventory. In early 2019, demand doubled from 69 to 123 between Jan 14 and Jan 21. Currently, we have 59 units on-hand. To prepare for the imminent Jan 1st surge (Period 47/48), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values to bypass the lagging effect of the recent low-demand autumn/winter data. I am forecasting a baseline for next period of approximately 60 units (aligned with 2019-01-07 data) to ensure we aren't caught understocked. Lead time L is consistent at 0.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/30, marking the transition into the New Year. This product (SUPREME tights) is a sports fitness item, which historically showed a massive demand surge starting in early January (Period 1 had demand of 127). Although demand over the last 4 periods (P43-P46) has been low (averaging ~4.5 units), we are at the precipice of the 'New Year, New Me' fitness resolution peak. Historical data from the beginning of 2019 shows demand jumped from ~52-69 to 123-141 within three weeks. To avoid the stockouts experienced in P2 and P3 of last year, I am aggressively setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to 130 and sigma_hat to 30. This anticipates the seasonal regime shift that aligns with both product type and calendar context. Inventory on hand is currently 55, so this will trigger a replenishment order to meet the imminent spike. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: New Year Fitness Peak Anticpated: Based on 2019 historical data (Jan demand 120-140) and product type (H&M Sport tights), a significant demand regime shift from <10 units to >120 units is expected starting Period 47/48.
