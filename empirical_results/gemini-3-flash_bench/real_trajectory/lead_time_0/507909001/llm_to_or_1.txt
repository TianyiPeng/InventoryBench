Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data for SKU 507909001 (Women's Blouse) shows a clear demand pattern: starting at 80 (Jan 7) and peaking at 194 (Jan 21), then tapering down to 129 (Feb 4). This suggests a post-holiday/early-spring peak that is now stabilizing. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately. The promised lead time is 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (all available history) to capture the current average demand level (approx 145 units), and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility. L is set to 'default' (0) as we have no arrival history to suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 182 units with a lead time of 0. These arrived immediately, but demand was 250, resulting in a stockout (sold 182, ending inventory 0). The actual lead time is confirmed as 0. The historical demand samples (80, 144, 194, 176, 129) and the actual Period 1 demand (250) suggest an increasing trend or higher volatility than the initial samples. The mean of the 5 samples is 144.6, but the recent demand of 250 is significantly higher. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent upward trajectory in demand while acknowledging the limited sample size. Period 2 starts with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I will set L=0 explicitly to match the observed lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. We have observed a significant demand surge over the last two weeks: Period 1 (250) and Period 2 (454), which are much higher than the January historical average (~144). This product (blouse) is likely benefiting from the transition into Spring retail season. In both Periods 1 and 2, we stocked out (on-hand 0, lost sales), meaning real demand is at least the observed levels. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=2 to focus on this new high-demand regime for both mean and volatility to ensure the base stock is high enough to meet the current trend and prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 11 (Period 1): demand spiked from Jan avg of ~144 to >350 (+140%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1086.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/4. The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a significant shift starting in Period 1 (Feb 11), likely entering a spring seasonal peak. Demand was suppressed in Periods 1 and 2 due to stockouts (sold < demand), with true signals being 250, 454, and 312 respectively. Average demand over these 3 periods is 338.7. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived in same period). On-hand inventory is 162. mu_hat should reflect the current regime (N=3) to handle the higher volume. Since we experienced stockouts in 2 out of 3 periods, I will use recent_N for both mean and volatility to ensure the OR backend captures this higher variance and mean to maintain service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $643.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507909001' is a 'Gently tailored shirt in a stretch cotton blend', a classic women's office-wear item likely seeing a seasonal uptick in February/March as consumers refresh work wardrobes for spring. Demand history shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 1: Jan demand averaged ~148, whereas Feb/March demand (Periods 1-4) averaged ~307.5. Specifically, demand values were 250, 454, 312, and 214. The recent drop to 214 suggests the peak of the initial spike may be subsiding, but demand remains significantly higher than the January baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 213, and the average demand over the last 4 periods is ~308, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime while allowing the recent lower data point (214) to temper the forecast. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. Mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 4 samples to reflect the higher mean and volatility seen since Feb 11.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 18, 2019. The SKU is a women's stretch cotton shirt. Historical demand analysis shows three distinct phases: a pre-simulation baseline (Jan) averaging ~144 units, a high-demand spike in Feb (Periods 1-3) averaging ~338 units, and a recent cooling off in March (Periods 4-5) averaging ~202 units. Lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as seen in all concluded periods. Since demand has stabilized significantly lower than the February peak, using a 3-period lookback (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is the best approach to capture the current March regime (approx 200 units) while still reflecting recent volatility. This prevents over-ordering based on the February surge while ensuring adequate stock for the current localized demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized in March: demand decreased from the Feb peak of ~338 to ~202 units (Periods 4-5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $571.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (March 25). Examining the history, the product ('Rebecca or Delphine shirt') saw a massive demand spike in late February (Periods 1-3 average: ~338) which has since stabilized to a lower level in March (Periods 4-6 average: ~192). The current date is late March, and there are no immediate seasonal holidays in the upcoming week that usually spike cotton shirt demand. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods, confirmed by every order from Period 1 to 6 arriving in the same period. For OR parameters: L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent stabilized March demand regime (Avg: 192.3). sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the current reduced volatility relative to the February spike. This inventory management approach balances the moderate $4 profit against the $1 holding cost by focusing on the most relevant recent consumption pattern.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507909001' is a stretch cotton shirt. Historical demand reflects a significant peak in February (avg ~338), followed by a stabilization in March (avg ~192 for Periods 4-6). However, the most recent period (Period 7, March 25) saw demand jump to 255 units, leading to a stockout (on-hand is now 0). Given the date (April 1), we are entering the spring season where shirts/blouses often see increased demand. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and prepare for potential spring growth, I will use a window of the last 4 periods (Periods 4-7) for mu_hat to capture the most recent March average plus the recent uptick (mean = (214+190+173+255)/4 = 208). I will set L to 'calculate' as history confirms the 0-period lead time. Sigma_hat will also be based on the recent 4 periods to reflect the current volatility (std dev of 214, 190, 173, 255 is approx 35.6).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing in late March/early April: Period 7 demand (255) vs previous 3-period avg (192), representing a 33% increase.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. We are seeing a significant demand surge in late March and early April (Easter season timing). Demand in Period 8 was 354 units, following 255 units in Period 7. This is significantly higher than the March average of approximately 192 units. The 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt' (Women's Blouse) is experiencing a seasonal spike. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (8/8 observations), so I will maintain L=0. To capture this recent upward trend and prevent stockouts (which occurred in P7 and P8 with 0 ending inventory), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the most recent regime shift (Periods 6-8: 173, 255, 354) which averages 260.67 units, better reflecting the current high-demand environment than the long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for April: Demand increased from March avg (~192) to early April avg (~305), a ~58% increase likely due to seasonal spring/Easter trends.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15. The 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt' is a spring/summer blouse. Historically, we saw a demand spike in April (Period 8: 354), but Period 9 demand dropped significantly to 147. This drop might indicate the passing of an Easter-related peak or a temporary correction. On-hand inventory is 190. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the high volatility observed in April (354 vs 147), I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period window (N=4: Periods 6-9) to capture the April transition while smoothing out the extreme fluctuations. This window gives a mean demand of approximately 232 per period. L is set to default (0). Sigma_hat uses the same N=4 window to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $779.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 22nd. The product is a women's blouse, which experiences seasonal shifts. Recent demand history shows significant volatility: P8 (354), P9 (147), and P10 (218). This fluctuation suggests we are transitioning out of the early April (Easter) peak observed in carry-over insights. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is 239.67 units. However, looking at the broader April regime (P7-P10), the mean is 243.5 units with a high standard deviation. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true (all orders from P1-P10 arrived same-period), I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most current, albeit volatile, demand trend while reacting slightly to the recent drop from the P8 peak. This balances the risk of stockouts against the holding costs for a product with a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's tailored shirt. We have observed consistently that the actual lead time is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Looking at the demand history since the April shift (Period 8 onwards), demand shows high volatility with values of 354, 147, 218, and 140. While there was a peak in early April (likely Easter-related), the most recent two periods (Periods 10 and 11) have averaged 179 units, showing a cooling trend as we move towards May. The current on-hand inventory is 189 units, which is sufficient to cover this recent average. To avoid overstocking while holding costs are significant ($1/unit), I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (April data) to capture the current regime's mean (~215), but use the 'recent_N' method for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in early April. This balances the risk of stockouts during occasional spikes against the cost of carrying inventory during the post-holiday dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high following the April peak; post-Easter demand (Periods 10-11) has stabilized at a lower average of ~179 units compared to the early April surge.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507909001' is a tailored stretch cotton shirt, likely a staple workwear item but subject to seasonal fluctuations. Current date is May 6, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant peak in April (Easter/Spring refresh), followed by a stabilization in late April. Looking at Periods 10, 11, and 12, demand has been 218, 140, and 148, respectively. The average of these 3 post-peak periods is ~169 units. Since the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (arrived in the same period as ordered), the OR backend needs to cover just the current period's demand (L=0, so mu_hat should reflect the demand expectation for 1+0=1 period). I will use a recent_N approach with N=3 to capture this post-peak stabilization level, which prevents over-ordering based on the high April demand while still maintaining a safe stock level (on-hand is 151, which is close to the recent average). Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Historical demand data shows a clear post-Easter decline. Recent demand for the last four periods (P10-P13) has been 218, 140, 148, and 112, averaging approximately 154 units per period. The most recent observation (P13) shows demand at 112, reinforcing a downward trend as we move further into the post-holiday spring season. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining sufficient service levels (given Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use a recent_N lookback of 4 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current demand regime of ~154 units while acknowledging the high volatility observed in the month of May.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized in May: May demand (P12-P13) reflects a further reduction to an average of ~130 units, down from the post-Easter April average of ~179.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's tailored shirt. We are currently in a declining demand regime following the April/Easter peaks. Demand for the last three periods (P12-P14) has been 148, 112, and 86, showing a clear downward trend towards the late-May baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To reflect this recent reduction in demand and avoid excess holding costs (Holding Cost = $1.0 vs Profit = $4.0), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand average (~115 units) and volatility. This helps the OR backend adjust the base stock level down to align with the current May performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized in late May: Demand continues to decline from the early May average (~130) to a more recent 3-period average of ~115 (P12-P14), with the most recent observation at 86 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear downward trend since the April peak. Demand has transitioned from an early May average of ~130 units (Periods 12-13) to a late May average of approximately 93 units across the last three weeks (86, 97, and the Period 14/15 trend). The most recent demand was 97 units. Given the transition into early June, which typically sees relatively stable demand for tailoring/blouses before potential summer sales, I will use a recent_N approach to capture this stabilized lower regime. Setting N=4 covers the transition from May (Periods 12-15), capturing the mean of approximately 110 units (148, 112, 86, 97). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. This strategy ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower demand environment, minimizing holding costs for this $1.0/unit item while maintaining a target service level based on recent volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a women's tailored blouse. Historically, we have observed a consistent decline in demand from the Easter peak in April (avg ~305) through May (avg ~130, then ~115) down to the most recent two periods (P15: 97, P16: 64). As we enter June, demand for this specific 'garment upper body' item appears to be stabilizing at a lower summer baseline. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0 periods, ensuring immediate replenishment. Given the clear downward trajectory and recent low observations (64, 97, 86 over the last three periods), I am narrowing the forecast window to the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the most current demand regime and avoid overstocking while holding costs are $1.0 vs $4.0 profit. The OR backend will use these recent samples to calculate a base stock that covers the next period's demand (L+1=1) at an 80% service level (4/(4+1)).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for June: Early June demand continues to decline, averaging ~81 units over the last 3 periods (P14-P16) compared to the mid-May average of ~115.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), demand unexpectedly spiked to 189 units, which is significantly higher than the average of the previous four periods (~82 units). This jump occurred at the beginning of June, suggesting a possible summer seasonality shift or a late spring promotion. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are no units in-transit. All historical orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, which is consistent with the promised lead time. To capture the recent volatility and the potential start of a higher-demand June regime, I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=4. This includes the spike and the preceding stabilized low-demand periods, providing a balanced but responsive forecast for the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in early June: Period 17 demand (189) is significantly higher than the mid-May to late-May average (~82), potentially marking a new summer demand regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a renewed demand regime in June. After a period of decline through May (averaging ~81 units), demand spiked to 189 in Period 17 and remained high at 176 in Period 18. This suggests a transition from spring to summer demand for this 'Gently tailored stretch cotton shirt'. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this new summer regime while accounting for the recent volatility, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=2 for mu_hat specifically targets the last two high-demand weeks (mean: 182.5), while setting N=3 for sigma_hat (including the last low week) ensures the OR backend accounts for the sudden shift in volatility. This aggressive replenishment is necessary to avoid further lost sales during this apparent June surge.

Carry-over insight: Sustained June demand regime confirmed: Period 17-18 average (182.5) is +125% higher than the late May average (~81).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt' has entered a higher-volume summer regime. For the last three periods (P17-P19), demand has been 189, 176, and 277, averaging 214 units. This is significantly higher than the late May average of ~81 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are no units in-transit. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (P1-P19) consistently show an actual lead time of 0. Given the recent upward surge (specifically the 277 units in P19), I will use the last 3 periods (P17-P19) to set the mean and volatility to capture this peak summer demand while maintaining enough stock to avoid the stockouts seen in the last three consecutive weeks.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a sustained summer demand regime (July 1st). The last four weeks (Periods 17-20) have shown demand levels of 189, 176, 277, and 205, averaging 211.75 units. This is a significant shift from the late-May lows (~81 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages for all previous periods. Given the product is a 'garment upper body shirt/blouse', demand is likely to remain steady or slightly increase through the peak summer season. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this current regime mean (~212) and volatility. The inventory position is currently 56 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Setting parameters to reflect this recent high-demand cluster will allow the OR backend to place an order that restores the base stock for the upcoming week.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime continues at a elevated level: P17-P20 average is ~212 units, confirming the summer spike previously noted.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th. Historical demand data and carry-over insights indicate that we are in a summer demand regime that began around early June (Period 17). Demand for this moderately tailored stretch cotton shirt has stabilized at an elevated level. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 209.4, with the last four periods specifically showing 189, 176, 277, 205, and 200 units. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (ordered and arrived same-period). Given the high demand compared to the current 50 units on-hand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this current summer regime while minimizing the influence of the lower demand seen in May. This approach aims to maintain a high service level for this profitable item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost) while responding to the recent stabilization in the 200+ units range.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909001 (Women's stretch cotton blouse) is currently in a sustained summer demand regime (July). Reviewing the historical demand since the June shift (Period 17 onwards): P17: 189, P18: 176, P19: 277, P20: 205, P21: 200, P22: 178. The 6-period average for this summer regime is approximately 204 units. The most recent demand (P22) was 178, indicating a slight softening but remaining within the high-volume summer bracket. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 65 units and a target replenishment level based on the summer average, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current stable summer regime (P17-P22) for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The OR backend's service level calculation (80% based on $4 profit and $1 holding cost) will handle the buffer required for the observed high volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a women's tailored blouse. Demand analysis shows a significant July summer regime (Period 17-22) with average demand around 209 units. However, Period 23 (July 15) shows a sharp decline to 105 units. This suggests the peak summer demand might be tapering off as we move into late July. Historically, demand for this product has shown volatility and distinct multi-week regimes followed by shifts. I will transition from the high-demand summer average (~209) to a more conservative recent average to account for the Period 23 drop. I will use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 18-23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer regime while weighting the recent decline. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak appears to be tapering: Period 23 demand (105) is ~50% lower than the P17-P22 average (209).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late July (Period 25). Historical data shows a clear breakdown of demand into regimes: a significant summer peak from early June (Period 17) through mid-July, which has now begun to taper off. In Periods 17-22, demand averaged approximately 204 units. However, in the last two periods (P23-P24), demand has dropped significantly to 105 and 117 units (average ~111), confirming the carry-over insight that the summer peak is tapering. Given this downward shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent trend while still acknowledging some variability. The promised lead time of 0 has been consistently met (actual lead time 0), so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed: late July demand (P23-P24) averaged 111 units, a ~45% decrease from the June/July peak average of ~204.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507909001 (Women's Blouse) is entering a post-summer tapering phase. The high-demand June/July regime (averaging ~209 units) has shifted to a lower late-July/early-August regime. Specifically, the last three periods (P23-P25) have seen demands of 105, 117, and 92, averaging 104.7 units. This matches the carry-over insight that the summer peak is tapering. For Period 26, I will use a N=3 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining a sufficient buffer, as lead time remains consistent at 0. Profit ($4) vs Holding Cost ($1) suggests a target service level of 80%, which the OR backend will handle using the provided parameters.

Carry-over insight: August demand regime shift confirmed: demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~105 units (P23-P25) following the June/July summer peak (~209 units), representing a ~50% reduction.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-August (Period 27). Historically, demand for this 'Gently tailored shirt' has shown distinct seasonal regimes: a spring peak (April), a late spring trough, and a summer peak (June/July). Period 26 demand (144) was higher than the late-July/early-August average of ~105, but still significantly below the mid-summer peak (~209). In Period 26, the system ran out of stock (sold=116, demand=144), meaning the observed demand of 144 is likely a floor for actual demand. Since August demand appears to be stabilizing at a lower level than summer but remains somewhat volatile (P23-P26: 105, 117, 92, 144), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current post-summer-peak regime while accounting for the recent uptick. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period), so L is set to default.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for August shows a surprising upward trend (P26: 144, P27: 212), contradicting the earlier observation of a post-summer tapering. The average demand over the last three periods (P25-P27) is approximately 149 units, which is significantly higher than the early August average of ~105. This surge may be related to late-summer promotions or 'back-to-work' shopping for blouses as we approach late August. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time remains 0, I will adjust the demand parameters to reflect this recent uptick using the last three periods (N=3) to capture the current momentum while maintaining a high service level, as stockouts occurred in both P26 and P27.

Carry-over insight: August demand increase: Late August (P26-P27) demand averaged ~178 units, a significant increase from the early August average of ~105 units, likely due to late-summer/back-to-work seasonality.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 507909001 (a tailored cotton-blend shirt) shows a significant recent uptick in late August. Demand increased from an early August average of ~105 (P23-25) to a late August average (P26-28) of 196 units. The most recent demand (P28) reached 232. This pattern likely reflects 'back-to-work' or late-summer transition seasonality for professional attire. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in-transit, I must set parameters to satisfy this elevated demand immediately. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific late-August demand regime (P26, P27, P28). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods according to conclusive historical records.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand regime (P26-P28) confirmed: average demand increased to 196 units, a ~85% increase from the early August base (~105), likely driven by back-to-work seasonality.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909001 (Women's stretch cotton shirt) is currently in a 'back-to-work' seasonal surge that began in late August (Period 26). The demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 144, 212, 232, and 255 respectively, showing a clear upward trend with an average of 210.75 units. Period 29 demand (255) specifically matched the high end of previous peaks. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent high-demand regime using N=4. I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=8) to capture the volatility observed during transitions between the summer low and the current autumn peak, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (P26-P29) confirmed: demand has increased for four consecutive weeks, averaging ~211 units, which is a ~100% increase over the early August base (~105).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909001 (women's blouse) is currently in a significant autumn/back-to-work demand regime. Demand has increased consecutively over the last five weeks: 144, 212, 232, 255, and 344 in Period 30. Significant stockouts have occurred in the last five periods (P26-P30), with sales limited by total on-hand inventory. The current regime (P26-P30) has a mean of 237.4, but the most recent observation of 344 is the most relevant given the clear upward trend. To capture this momentum and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the recent acceleration, and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with this growth. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by history.

Carry-over insight: September demand acceleration confirmed: Demand has increased for five consecutive weeks (P26-P30), peaking at 344 units, representing a sustained upward trend compared to the early August average of ~105.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1196.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt' is currently in a high-growth phase associated with September's back-to-work/autumn seasonality. Demand has risen consistently over the last six periods (P26-P31), effectively tripling from ~100 units to a peak of 344 units, with the most recent observation at 329 units. The average demand for the September cluster (P29-P31) is approximately 309 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To capture this sustained upward trend while accounting for the high volatility shown in recent stock-outs (P26-P31 were mostly sold out), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 (covering P28-P31) to set mu_hat, providing a base stock level that reflects the current high-demand regime of ~290 units per period. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the increased variance observed during this acceleration phase, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer against further spikes.

Carry-over insight: September demand plateau confirmed: Demand has maintained a high level for three consecutive weeks (P29-P31), averaging ~310 units, compared to the early August average of ~105.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909001 (Women's Blouse) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime, likely driven by autumn/back-to-work seasonality. Demand has remained consistently high for the past four periods (P29-P32), with observations of 255, 344, 329, and 339 units. The mean demand over these last four periods is approximately 317 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals and no stockouts caused by delivery delays (stockouts are currently due to demand exceeding ordered capacity). Given the stable but high demand plateau, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current plateau while ignoring the lower August ramp-up. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) targets the current elevated run-rate.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507909001 (a stretch cotton blouse) has been in a sustained upward trend throughout September, likely driven by late-summer/autumn professional wear seasonality ('back-to-work'). The last five periods (P29-P33) have shown high, accelerating demand: 255, 344, 329, 339, and most recently 378 units. The average demand over the last three weeks (P31-P33) is approximately 349 units, which is significantly higher than the August base. Stockouts have occurred in the last four consecutive periods because demand has consistently exceeded the inventory levels calculated by the OR backend. To capture this 'September peak' and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 360 (per period, totaling 360 for L=0) to reflect the most recent demand level (378) while slightly smoothing. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this high-demand regime. Actual lead time has consistently remained at the promised 0 periods, which I will continue to use.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand regime confirmed: weekly demand has stabilized at a high level (average ~349 units over P31-P33), representing the peak of the autumn professional wear season.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. This SKU (Womens Tailoring Blouse) has been in a high-demand regime since late August, peaking in mid-to-late September with demands exceeding 300 units. However, Period 34 (September 30) showed a significant drop in demand to 208 units, compared to the previous 3-period average of ~349. This likely indicates the post-peak phase of the autumn professional wear season. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while holding costs are relatively high ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to a more recent window (N=4) to account for the potential downward trend observed in Period 34 while still respecting the elevated baseline of the current season. Promoting a recent sigma_hat (N=4) also captures the high volatility seen during the peak-to-taper transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak appears to be tapering: Period 34 demand (208) is ~40% lower than the P31-P33 average (349).

Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507909001 (Women's Blouse) is clearly tapering off following the autumn professional wear peak observed throughout September. Period 34 demand was 208, and Period 35 demand further dropped to 128, compared to the P31-P33 average of approximately 349 units. This represents a significant and rapid decline as we move mid-October. The current on-hand inventory is 248 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand observation (128). To avoid excessive holding costs during this downtrend, I am shift the demand estimation methods to a shorter lookback. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this sharp reduction in mean and volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, which is confirmed by the 'Period 35 conclude' message showing that the order placed in P35 arrived in P35.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak for professional wear has ended: Demand has dropped for two consecutive weeks (P34: 208, P35: 128) from the September peak (~349), suggesting a return to a lower baseline.

We currently have 219 units on-hand, which already exceeds the last two weeks of demand. To avoid excessive holding costs in this lower-demand regime, I will use a shorter window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current baseline of ~130 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Gently tailored shirt' has passed its autumn professional-wear peak (Sept average ~349) and is settling into a lower, more stable regime for late October. Recent demand observations (P34-P37) are 208, 128, 127, and 158. This suggests a new mean demand level of approximately 155-160 units (average of P34-P37 is 155.25). The most recent jump to 158 indicates that while the peak is over, demand is not collapsing to early-summer lows. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'concluded' messages. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this new post-peak stabilization period (approx late October context) and ensure the OR backend adjusts the base stock level to match this reduced demand volume, preventing excess inventory holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak regime confirmed (P34-P37): Demand stabilized at ~155 units, down ~55% from the September peak (~349).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

The autumn peak for professional wear (September-October) has clearly concluded. Since Period 35, demand has settled into a lower regime, with the last four periods averaging approximately 130 units (128, 127, 158, and 106). The most recent observation (106) suggests demand may be returning to the baseline levels observed at the start of the year. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect this post-peak stabilization. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The 'Gently tailored shirt' for women has transitioned out of the autumn professional wear peak (Sept/Oct) and is now in a lower, more stable late-autumn regime. Demand over the last 6 periods (P34-P39) has averaged approximately 138 units, significantly lower than the ~350 units seen during the September peak. The last two periods (P38 and P39) have been very stable at 106 and 104 units respectively, suggesting a secondary downward shift or stabilization towards a winter baseline. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level for this relatively low-holding-cost item, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the post-peak mean and volatility, which provides a representative sample of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak regime (P34-P39) demand has settled to an average of ~138 units, with the most recent two weeks (P38-P39) showing further stabilization around ~105 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909001 (a tailored blouse) is currently in a stable post-autumn regime. After the significant September peak for professional wear, demand has stabilized over the last few periods (P38-P40 averaged ~102 units). The most recent demand was 96. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' replenishment. I will use a recent window of N=4 (P37-P40) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stabilization following the October drop (P37: 158, P38: 106, P39: 104, P40: 96). This choice of N captures the gradual downward trend toward a late-autumn baseline. The OR backend will use these to maintain a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand regime (P37-P40) has shifted lower, with demand stabilizing around ~100 units (avg 102), a further decrease from the mid-October average of ~138.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has shifted into a lower-volume post-autumn regime (P37-P41), averaging approximately 114 units over the last five weeks (158, 106, 104, 96, 105). The most recent four weeks (P38-P41) show even tighter stabilization around 103 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for small fluctuations, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the current low-demand stability. The on-hand inventory is 35 units, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to meet the base stock level for the upcoming period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Historical data and product description (professional tailoring/blouses) show clear seasonal peaks in early autumn (Sept) and early spring (Feb/April), likely driven by professional/workwear cycles. We are currently in a post-autumn trough. Recent demand has stabilized: Period 38-41 averaged ~103 units. Period 42 showed a jump to 150, which likely reflects the start of December holiday shopping or promotional activity (Black Friday/Cyber Monday period). However, demand typically tapers after this initial December spike before the January lull. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (including the recent spike) to provide enough buffer for early December demand while recognizing the overall lower regime compared to autumn. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Early December demand spike observed (P42: 150 units), likely driven by seasonal holiday shopping, interrupting the stable ~100 unit baseline seen in late fall.

The SKU 507909001 (Women's Blouse) is currently in the holiday shopping season (December 9). After a spike in Period 42 (150 units), demand dropped significantly in Period 43 to 50 units. However, looking at the lead-time history, actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 81 units. Given the proximity to the December holiday peak, the low demand in Period 43 (50) might be a weekly fluctuation rather than a full regime shift downward, especially considering the 150-unit demand observed just two weeks prior. To balance the risk of a pre-holiday surge against high holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 (covering the late Nov/early Dec window: 105, 150, 50, and the current forecast context) to stabilize the mean. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to capture the recent volatility (150 vs 50). L remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Holiday season demand shows high volatility (P42: 150, P43: 50); while Period 43 was low, a secondary pre-Christmas surge is possible.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), approaching the final weeks of the year. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Demand over the last three weeks has been volatile (150, 50, 103), likely reflecting holiday-induced variance. The current on-hand inventory is 32 units. Given the 'Gently tailored shirt' description and the historical autumn peak (Sep/Oct), we are now in a lower baseline regime compared to the autumn, but must account for holiday spikes. I will use a recent_N window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current holiday-season variance (average ~102) and a slightly wider window (N=6) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed since late November. This setting should maintain a safe stock level to capture any late-December surge without excessive overstocking as we approach the game's end.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). We are in the immediate pre-Christmas/Holiday week. Looking at the demand history for December (P42-P45), demand has been volatile but shows a moderate upward trend from the late-autumn baseline of ~100 units (P42: 150, P43: 50, P44: 103, P45: 114). The average demand over these 4 weeks is 104.25 units. Historically, after Christmas, professional wear (blouses) can experience a slight drop followed by a 'back-to-office' resolution spike in early January. For Period 46, I expect demand to remain similar to the recent 2-week average (~108 units). I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current holiday regime mean, which keeps the forecast around 104 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period responsive ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: December holiday demand (P42-P45) has stabilized at an average of ~104 units, maintaining the late-fall baseline despite weekly volatility (standard deviation ~41).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on December 30, 2019. Historically, demand for this professional blouse SKU exhibits high volatility during the December holiday season (P42-P46) with a mean of ~107 units and a high standard deviation (approx 40). Looking ahead to early January, historical demand samples from 2019-01-07 through 2019-02-04 show an average of 144.6 units, starting with 80 in the first week of Jan and ramping up to 194 by mid-month. Given that we are entering the New Year/Back-to-Work period, I anticipate a return to this higher baseline (~145 units) compared to the late December level. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent holiday volatility but adjust for the expected January uptick by using a slightly higher baseline of 145 based on historical Jan samples. However, to stay within the permitted method constraints, I select recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent mean (~107) and sigma_hat (~40). Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1 (q=0.8), the backend will maintain a healthy safety stock. No evidence of lost shipments as L=0 is consistently maintained.
