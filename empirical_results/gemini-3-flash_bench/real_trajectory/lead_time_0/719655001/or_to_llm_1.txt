Historical demand from the last five weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows an average of 112.6 units per period (99, 127, 104, 87, 146). The current date is 2019-02-11. Valentines Day is Feb 14th, which typically sees a spike in lingerie/underwear demand, followed by potential post-holiday normalization. The OR recommendation of 113 units is based on the running average. Given the 0-period promised lead time, I will follow the OR recommendation for this initial period. Inventory is currently at 0, so getting stock in immediately is critical. The OR cap is 113, and since profit equals holding cost (fractile 0.5), it aims for the median demand.

However, it fails to account for the recent surge to 173 and the fact that we completely stocked out. 5. **Strategy**: Since lead time is 0, the order placed now will satisfy Period 2 demand.

Lead-time inference: Period 1 and Period 2 both showed 'lead_time was 0 periods', confirming the promised 0-period lead time is active. Inventory analysis: We started with 0 on-hand and have 0 in-transit because everything ordered in previous periods arrived and was immediately sold out. Specifically, in Period 1, we ordered 113 but demand was 173; in Period 2, we ordered 160 but demand was 199. Both periods resulted in stockouts and lost sales. Historical samples (Jan/Feb) showed an average demand of 112.6, but the actual demand in the last two periods (173, 199) suggests a significant upward shift or seasonal trend for late February. The OR recommendation of 134 units is too low because it looks at the long-term historical mean (~113) and doesn't account for the recent surge.

The product is a pack of cotton hipster underwear, a staple with relatively stable but currently elevated demand compared to the initial January samples. 3.

Strategy: The critical fractile is 0.5 (Profit 1.0 / (Profit 1.0 + Holding 1.0)), suggesting we should target the median demand. A target inventory (base stock) based on the recent average of 173 seems appropriate. To reach 173 units available for the period with 53 on hand, I need 120 units.

The specific 'Greta Ch hipster 3p' (underwear) shows a sharp decline from Feb peaks to P4 (96), suggesting the high Feb demand regime (avg 173) noted in carry-over insights is cooling down as we move into March. \n3.

OR Comparison: The OR recommendation of 89 units is based on a blend of all historical data. Given the current 39 units on hand and a recent demand average of ~100, we need approximately 61 units to cover immediate demand. However, to maintain a safe buffer against the variability seen in February, I will target a slightly higher stock level. 5. Strategy: I will order 101 units.

The product is cotton hipster underwear, which is a staple item with relatively stable demand outside of promotional windows. \n4. Strategy & OR Adjustment: The OR recommendation is 118 units. This is based on a mix of high Feb demand and recent stable demand. Given that demand has hovered between 92-115 for the last 5 weeks, and the current on-hand is nearly zero (5), we need to cover the upcoming period's demand fully. The critical fractile for this item is 0.5 (Profit 1.0, Holding 1.0), meaning the base stock should technically target the median demand to minimize total cost. However, since lead time is 0 and demand is stable, following the OR recommendation of 118 provides a small safety buffer (approx 10-15 units) against a slight uptick without incurring high holding costs. I will follow the OR's 118 units to replenish stock and meet the steady 100-115 demand observed recently.",

However, in the last two periods (P9 and P10, dates April 8 and April 15), demand has dropped significantly to 53 units/period. This suggests a new demand regime shift downward following the early spring stabilization. April demand appears much lower than March.\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: I currently have 65 units on-hand. With a current demand of 53, I already have over a week's worth of stock. No units are currently in transit.\n\n4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR baseline suggests 49 units, but this is based on historical samples starting from January, which are heavily skewed by the high February peaks. The OR doesn't react quickly enough to the recent drop to 53 units.\n\n5. **Strategy**: The critical fractile is 0.5 (as Profit=1 and Holding=1), meaning the goal is to target the median demand. Recent evidence suggests the median is now near 53. If I order 49 units as suggested by the OR, I would have 114 units available, which is double the current demand. To avoid high holding costs while protecting against a modest rebound, I will reduce the order significantly.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The current period is December 30th (Period 47). Looking at the product history, there was a massive demand spike in Period 42 (Black Friday/late November) reaching 385 units. However, demand has since returned to a mid-to-high range (~105-140 units) during the December holiday weeks. The OR recommendation is 116 units, which is based on historical averages and capped to prevent over-ordering. Given that on-hand inventory is very low (11 units) and lead time is consistently 0 periods, we need to order enough to cover the immediate demand of this final holiday/New Year transition week. Recent demand over the last four periods (P43-P46) has averaged ~118 units. Ordering 120 units aligns closely with both the OR recommendation (116) and the recent demand average, ensuring we satisfy current customers without incurring excessive holding costs on a potentially cooling post-holiday market.",
