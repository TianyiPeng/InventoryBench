  "rationale": "Product Description: 'Luna skinny RW' (Women's denim jeans). Seasonality: This is an 'Everyday Collection' staple, typically seeing stable demand, though early February (current date) is post-New Year and pre-Spring, often showing a climbing demand trend as retailers transition to new collections. Historical Data Analysis: The demand samples show a clear upward trend from 96 (Jan 7) to 140 (Feb 4), increasing by roughly 10-15 units per week. The average over the last 5 weeks is 119.4. Forecast for Period 1: Following the trend, I expect demand to be between 145 and 155 for the week starting Feb 11. Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive in the same period to satisfy this week's demand. Inventory: Current on-hand is 0. Decision Logic: I need to cover Period 1's expected demand (approx 150) plus a small buffer for Period 2, as I don't want to stock out immediately if the trend continues. Ordering 160 units provides coverage for the forecasted week plus a 10-unit safety margin.",

In P5, we sold out completely (starting inventory 300 vs demand 312), resulting in lost sales. Lead time is reliably 0 periods.

Period 30 saw a significant demand spike to 300 units, significantly higher than the late-August average of ~180. This aligns with seasonal patterns where denim demand surges as cooler weather approaches. Given that on-hand inventory is currently 0 and lead time is consistently 0 periods, I must order enough to cover this new high-demand regime. The demand jumped from 163 to 300; while 300 might be a slight peak, the 'Spring' peak reached up to 312.
