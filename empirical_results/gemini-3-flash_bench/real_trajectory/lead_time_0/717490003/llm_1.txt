  "rationale": "a) Product Analysis: The item '717490003' is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt in soft jersey). As of Feb 11, we are moving into the spring season in many markets, though demand for basics like jersey tees is often somewhat stable but prone to seasonal lifts. b) Demand Analysis: Historical data shows a significant drop from early January (49, 47 units) to late January/early February (19, 15, 14 units). This suggests a post-holiday slump or a specific seasonal shift. The current demand level seems to have stabilized around 14-15 units/week. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand within this same period (Period 1). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. e) Decision: I need to cover Period 1 demand immediately. Given the recent trend (14-15 units), and the fact that stockouts are costly (profit $1 vs holding cost $1), I will aim for a conservative but sufficient quantity. I'll order 25 units to satisfy immediate demand and provide a small buffer for Period 2, as I have 0 starting stock.",

However, Period 1 (Feb 11) had a demand of 21, and Period 2 (Feb 18) jumped significantly to 43. This suggests a potential return to the higher demand regime seen in early January (~45-50 units). In Period 2, we stocked out, selling only 30 units because demand was 43. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). To maximize profit and meet the resurgent demand while minimizing stockout risk, I will target an inventory level that covers the high-end demand seen recently.

However, recent game history shows a significant and rapid escalation: Period 1 demand was 21, Period 2 was 43, and Period 3 reached 79. My previous orders (25, 26, 50) have consistently underestimated this growth, resulting in lost sales (stockouts in P2 and P3). The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by 'conclude' messages. For Period 4 (March 4), demand is trending upward sharply (+100% then +83% week-over-week). Given the seasonal shift towards spring and the clear momentum, I forecast Period 4 demand to be at least 100-120 units. To capture this growth and avoid another stockout, I will order 120 units. Since lead time is 0, these will arrive in the same period to meet this demand.",

Currently, in Period 5 (March 11), we have 81 units on hand. Considering the lead time is consistently 0 periods, we can react instantly to demand. Given the recent drop to 39 units and the historical baseline of 15-50 units for this time of year, 81 units already provides more than 2 periods of coverage.

(b) Demand regime analysis: We have seen a massive upward shift in demand. After stabilizing in the 40s in mid-March, demand spiked to 122 in Period 6 and 148 in Period 7. This represents a sustained high-demand regime, far exceeding the February baseline of ~15-49.

Looking at the demand history, we have seen two distinct peaks: an early-April peak (~130 units) and a mid-May peak (up to 160 units). However, Period 13 showed a sharp drop in demand to 45 units. This pattern of 'sawtooth' demand (peaks followed by sudden drops) suggests either high volatility or a clearing out of local demand after a surge. Historically, late April to mid-May has been very strong (104, 160 units), but the most recent data point (45) suggests a cooling off or a temporary lull. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is currently 115 units. Given the holding cost is $1.00 (equal to profit), carrying excess stock is risky. A demand of 45-60 units is likely for the coming week if the peak has indeed subsided, but because weather-driven demand can be erratic, I will maintain a safety buffer.

Historical data from early 2019 shows demand in January was around 47-49 units before dropping to ~15-20 units as later winter set in. Analysis of the late-summer transition suggests a return to a lower baseline as the peak summer/back-to-school season ends. Period 30 demand (51) reflects this cooling. With on-hand inventory at 59 units and 0-period lead time, I plan for a demand of approximately 45-50 units in Period 31. Current inventory (59) already covers this anticipated demand plus a small safety buffer.

However, as this is the final decision period (P47/47), the primary goal is to maximize total reward, specifically Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory. Since the lead time is 0 periods, any order placed now will arrive for Period 47's demand resolution and be charged holding cost if not sold. Looking at the historical context for the first week of January, demand rose toward ~49. To capture this expected demand while minimizing the risk of holding costs on the very last day of the game, I will target a stock level of 49 units. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 49 units.",
