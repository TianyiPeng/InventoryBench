Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for product '715624001' (Becka hoodie) shows a significant upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 37, 22, 53, 215, 302. This sharp increase coincides with late January and early February, likely driven by seasonal demand for hoodies or a new product launch phase. The promised lead time is 0. Given the rapid shift in demand, the most recent samples (last 2-3 weeks) are more representative of the current regime than the earlier, much lower numbers. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this recent spike (average ~190, std ~124) while ensuring enough inventory to meet the 300+ demand observed in the most recent week. The promised lead time (0) will be used as the starting point until actual lead times are observed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a basic hoodie. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 37, 22, 53, 215, 302, and most recently 131 in Period 1. The spike starting late January (Period -1 and 0) suggests a seasonal shift or promotion. Period 1's demand (131) is lower than the immediately preceding weeks but significantly higher than the early January levels. Given the product type (hoodie) and the February date, we are likely in a high-demand winter/spring transition period. I will use the most recent 3 periods (Jan 28, Feb 4, Feb 11) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time of 0 was confirmed in Period 1 (ordered 398, arrived 398 in the same period).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. We have historical demand data for the 'Becka hoodie' showing a clear upward trend: January started in the 20-50 range and spiked to 215 (Jan 28) and 302 (Feb 04). In Period 1 and 2 (Feb 11 and Feb 18), demand stabilized at exactly 131 units each week. This suggests we are in a post-peak stability phase or a localized plateau. The promised lead time is 0, and the last two periods confirmed actual lead time is indeed 0. On-hand inventory is 226 units, which is roughly 1.7 weeks of the recent 131-unit demand. Given the product is a hoodie (seasonal/winter item) and we are moving into late February, demand might soften further or stay steady before spring. I will use a conservative mu_hat reflecting the recent regime (131 units/period) while acknowledging the higher volatility seen in the total historical sample to ensure a safe buffer. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (P1, P2, and the high Jan 28/Feb 04 samples are too distant) to capture this lower, stable demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: After peaking at 302 (Feb 04), demand has stabilized at 131 units for the last 2 consecutive periods (Feb 11-18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1163.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (March 4) shows a significant demand drop to 76 units compared to the previous stable regime of 131 units observed in Period 1 and 2. This coincides with early March, where demand for a 'Becka hoodie' (soft brushed inside sweatshirt fabric) typically begins to soften as winter transitions to spring. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 281 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand (76). Since the OR engine uses \u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + \u03a6\u22121(0.95)\xb7\u03c3\u0302/\u221a(1+L) as a cap, I will adjust mu_hat using the last 3 samples (131, 131, 76) to capture the cooling trend while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. N=3 is chosen for both mu_hat and sigma_hat because it captures the post-peak regime (Feb 11 - Feb 25). My previous insight about stabilization at 131 is now being challenged by the 76 unit demand, so I'm updating my forecast logic to react to this softening.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-winter demand softening observed from Period 1-3, dropping from an average of ~131 to 76 in Period 3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/11. The product is a 'Becka hoodie', which typically sees peak demand in winter and tapers off as spring approaches. Historical demand confirms this trend: demand peaked at 302 (Period -1, Feb 04), then followed a clear downward trajectory: 131, 131, 76, and finally 48 in Period 4. This represents a sustained regime shift from high-winter demand to spring-transition demand. The current on-hand inventory is 233 units, which is significantly overstocked given the most recent demand of 48. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time = 0). Since demand is trending downwards and we are moving into warmer months (March), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=2 to weight the most recent low-demand observations (76 and 48) more heavily, as they are most representative of the current spring regime. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the current, lower volatility. This will signal the OR backend to restrict ordering until the current high inventory is worked through.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-winter demand has fallen from an average of 131 units in Feb to a current level of ~48 units in early March, consistent with seasonal hoodie demand tapering.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Becka hoodie', which is experiencing a seasonal sales decline as we transition into spring (mid-March). Historical demand shows a clear downward trend: after peaking at 302 in early February, demand fell to ~131 (P1-P2), then to 76 (P3), and has now stabilized at approximately 48.5 units over the last two weeks (P4: 48, P5: 49). Current on-hand inventory is 184 units, which at the current demand rate of ~49 units/week, represents roughly 3.7 weeks of supply. Given the promised lead time is 0 and the actual lead time has consistently been 0, we have significant excess inventory. My strategy is to set lead time to 0 and use use mu_hat based on the most recent demand regime (last 2-3 periods) to reflect the new lower baseline. The OR backend will see that (on-hand + in-transit) > base_stock and will naturally order 0 units, allowing us to burn down the current surplus and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~49 units/week since Period 4 (early March), confirming the end of the winter peak for hoodies.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. We are managing the 'Becka hoodie', which is a seasonal winter/early spring item. Historical data shows a clear demand tapering from the winter peak (over 300 units in early February) to a stable spring regime. For the last three periods (P4-P6), demand has been incredibly stable at 48, 49, and 51 units respectively, establishing a current mean of approximately 49.3 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods when orders were placed. We currently have 133 units on hand with no units in transit. Given the current demand (approx. 50/week), our stock covers nearly 3 weeks of demand. Since L=0, we only need to cover (L+1)=1 week of demand. The OR backend will see that our inventory (133) exceeds the base stock level calculated from the current regime, resulting in no order, which is appropriate as we bleed down excess inventory from the previous higher-demand period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8 (April 01), transitioning deeper into Spring. The product is a 'Becka hoodie,' which typically sees higher demand in cold weather. Historical data and recent observations show a clear regime shift: demand averaged 206 in late Jan/early Feb, dropped to ~131 in mid-Feb, then stabilized significantly around ~49 units/week from Period 4 (March 04) to Period 7 (March 25). My carry-over insights confirm this steady state. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (as observed in Periods 1-3), the inventory needs to cover only the current period's demand. With 84 units on-hand and an average demand of 49.25 units over the last 4 periods, we are over-stocked relative to current demand, but the system will compute an order if the calculated base stock exceeds on-hand. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this stable March regime while excluding the high winter peaks, ensuring the OR backend targets the current demand level of ~49 rather than the historical average of ~111.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a hoodie, and we have entered a stable spring demand regime of approximately 50 units per week. Specifically, for the last 5 periods (Period 4-8), demand has been 48, 49, 51, 49, and 52, which gives an average of 49.8 units and very low variance. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory has finally depleted to 32 units on-hand with nothing in-transit, which is below our expected weekly demand. To maintain the service level while minimizing holding costs in this stable low-demand regime, I will set L to 0 and use the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to place a replenishment order that covers the immediate demand without overstocking as the winter season ends.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Demand for the Becka hoodie has remained remarkably stable for the last 6 periods (since Period 4), with an average demand of approximately 50.0 units (48, 49, 51, 49, 52, 51). Period 9 demand was 51. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as confirmed by the Period 9 order arriving in the same period. Since on-hand inventory is now only 2 units and there is no inventory in transit, a fresh order is required to meet the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encompasses the entire stable period following the seasonal winter peak decrease.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. We are selling the 'Becka hoodie', a seasonal upper-body garment. Historical demand has transitioned from a winter peak (302-131 units) into a stabilized spring regime. Since Period 4 (early March), demand has hovered around a mean of ~45-50 units per week. However, in Period 10, demand dropped significantly to 19 units, possibly indicating a further seasonal tapering as spring advances or a random fluctuation. The on-hand inventory is 34 units. With a lead time of 0 (confirmed by recent arrivals in P9 and P10), the system orders to meet the base stock target within the same period. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the stable spring regime while acknowledging the recent dip. This covers periods from P4 to P10 (mean \u2248 45). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=7) to capture the lower volatility observed during this stable period compared to the high-variance winter peak. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock to satisfy the current average demand (around 45 units) without overstocking as the hoodie season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: Potential secondary seasonal softening in late April with demand dropping to 19 units, compared to the previous stable spring mean of ~50.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory was fully depleted (65 units sold vs 87 units demand), resulting in 22 units of lost sales. This indicates a significant demand rebound at the end of April (2019-04-22), contrary to the previous expectation of a secondary softening. Demand jumped from 19 to 87 units. Historically, after the winter peak, demand stabilized around ~50 units for several weeks (Periods 4-9). The recent jump to 87 might be a pre-summer transition or a specific promotion. Given the stockout, I need to restock decisively. I will use the last 3 periods (including the dip to 19 and the spike to 87) to capture this new volatility and mean. N=3 is chosen to balance the recent extreme low and extreme high values while prioritizing responsiveness to the current stockout situation. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late April: Period 10 dropped to 19 followed by a Period 11 spike to 87 (+350%), causing a stockout of 22 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are managing SKU 715624001 (Becka hoodie). Currently, it is early May (2019/5/06). The product is a hoodie, which typically sees high demand in winter and a decrease in spring. However, we have observed a significant unexpected surge in demand over the last two periods: Period 11 (87 units) and Period 12 (129 units), causing consecutive stockouts. This contradicts the earlier seasonal downward trend. In Period 12, we sold 109 units but the demand was 129, leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To recover from stockouts and capture the current high demand volatility (likely a late-spring clearance or a specific fashion trend), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3: 19, 87, 129) to roughly average 78, but since the trend is sharply upward, I will use an explicit forecast. I expect demand for Period 13 to remain high, potentially matching or exceeding the recent 129. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 130 to ensure sufficient stock-up. I will also use explicit sigma_hat based on the high variance observed in the last three weeks (std of 19, 87, 129 is approx 55).

Carry-over insight: Unexpected late-spring demand surge confirmed: Demand rose from 19 (P10) to 129 (P12), a 570% increase, contrary to typical seasonal tapering for hoodies.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14 (May 13, 2019). The product is a 'Becka hoodie,' which typically sees peak demand in winter (Jan-Feb) and tapering in spring. However, we recently observed a significant demand surge in late April (P11=87, P12=129), followed by a retreat to 68 units in Period 13. This suggesting the late-spring surge may have peaked. Since on-hand inventory is 153 units and the lead time remains stable at 0 periods, we need to set mu_hat to cover this new, higher baseline while accounting for recent volatility. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent shift (averaging roughly 95 units/period) while ignoring the much lower March/early April demand. This helps the OR engine maintain a safety buffer against the higher observed volatility (std dev ~31) following the recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in May: After an unexpected peak of 129 (P12), demand retracted to 68 (P13), establishing a more volatile late-spring regime compared to the stable March/April baseline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-20. We are observing high volatility in late spring for this hoodie SKU. After a significant demand peak in Period 12 (129 units) and a subsequent drop, demand has stabilized over the last two periods at 68 and 70 units respectively. This suggests a new late-spring mean of approximately 69-70 units, which is higher than the early spring baseline of ~50. On-hand inventory is 83 units with no units in transit. Since the promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the recent volatility and the stabilization around 70 units, covering Period 12, 13, and 14 (Avg: 89 units). This provides a buffer against the recent high-demand spikes while reflecting the current higher-than-March levels. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased variance seen in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Late-spring demand (May) has stabilized at a higher level (~70 units/week) compared to the March-April baseline (~50 units/week), despite high volatility in late April.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Becka hoodie (SKU 715624001) is currently in a late-spring regime (May 2019). While historically a winter item, we have observed a sustained shift in demand since Period 13 (early May). The last three periods of demand have been 68, 70, and 82, showing an upward trend and relative stability compared to the mid-April volatility. The mean of these last three periods (N=3) is approximately 73.3 units. Given the recent spike to 82 units, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this latest slightly higher baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as seen in the game history (most recently confirmed in P15). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the current period-over-period volatility in this new May regime, which is higher than the stable March/April period but lower than the April-to-May transition peak.

Carry-over insight: Late-spring demand (May) has stabilized and is trending upwards (82 units in Period 15), confirming a baseline shift from ~50 units in April to ~73 units in late May.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for the 'Becka Hoodie' (715624001) has transitioned from a stable March/April baseline of ~50 units/week to a higher, albeit volatile, late-spring/early-summer level. In the last four periods (Periods 13-16), demand has been 68, 70, 82, and 64, averaging 71 units/week. This confirms the previously noted regime shift and provides a stable basis for recent_N forecasting. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will continue to use the 'default' lead time method. To capture the current demand level while accounting for the recent volatility observed in late April/May, I will use a N=4 period lookback (the length of the new regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we cover the current ~71 unit/week demand while providing enough safety stock (sigma_hat) to protect against the fluctuations seen in this seasonal period. On-hand inventory is currently low (22 units), so this configuration will trigger an order to restore the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Early June demand regime confirmed: Average demand has settled at ~71 units/week (Periods 13-16), up from the spring baseline of ~50 units, despite the seasonal expectation for hoodie demand to decline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand for the Becka hoodie has shown a recent stabilization following a late-spring surge. After the surge to 129 units in Period 12, demand has settled into a moderately volatile range. The last five periods (P13-P17) show demand of 68, 70, 82, 64, and 48 units respectively, giving a 5-period average of ~66 units. Notably, Period 17 showed a drop to 48 units, which aligns with the expected seasonal cooling for a sweatshirt product in June. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. With on-hand inventory at 36 units and lead time at 0, I will use a 5-period lookback (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-spring/early-summer regime while discarding the extreme spike from April. This approach allows the model to adjust for the recent softening in demand (48 units) while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility (~12.8 std dev in the last 5 periods) and ensuring we don't over-order as summer temperatures rise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in June: Post-surge demand has transitioned from a May average of ~73 units to a lower early-June level of 48 units in Period 17, suggesting seasonal hoodie demand is finally commencing its summer decline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for the 'Becka hoodie' has shown significant volatility in late spring but appears to be settling into a lower early-summer regime. The last two periods (P17 and P18) saw demands of 48 and 58, averaging 53 units, which is a decline from the May average of ~73 units. This aligns with the expected seasonal trend for hoodies in the Northern Hemisphere as temperatures rise. Currently, on-hand inventory is 29 units with nothing in-transit. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while acknowledging the downward trend, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 (capturing data from mid-May onwards) to balance the high May demand against the recent June softening. This N selection provides a conservative forecast that covers the recent stabilization around 50-60 units while maintaining enough safety stock to handle minor volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24 (late June). Demand in Period 19 dropped significantly to 18 units, following a Period 17 drop to 48. This confirms a clear downward trend in hoodie demand as we enter summer. The previous May/Early June average of ~70 units is no longer relevant. The last three periods (P17-P19) show a declining demand of 48, 58, and 18, averaging 41 units. However, the drop to 18 in P19 is a strong signal of seasonal tapering. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. Given current on-hand inventory of 66 units and the observed drop to 18 units, we are likely overstocked for the summer baseline. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this downward shift in mu_hat and sigma_hat, which allows the OR engine to reduce orders while maintaining a buffer for late-June volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in late June: Period 19 demand dropped to 18 units, confirming a definitive summer decline from the previous May/early-June baseline of ~70.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (July 1st), the demand for the Becka hoodie continues to reflect a structural summer decline. The demand in the last two periods was 18 and 19 units, respectively, which is a significant drop from the May/early-June average of ~70. This aligns with the seasonal transition into mid-summer where demand for sweatshirt fabrics is typically at its lowest. Current on-hand inventory is 57 units, which is approximately three times the current weekly demand. Given the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, the current stock levels provide significant coverage against the lower summer demand regime. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this latest stabilization at ~19 units per week (Periods 19, 20, and the expected demand for 21). This provides a conservative base stock that avoids over-ordering while the seasonal trend is downward.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Demand has stabilized at ~19 units/week over the last 2 periods (late June), down from the early-June average of 53 units (-64%).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '715624001' (Becka hoodie) experienced an unexpected demand surge in Period 21 (July 1st) of 104 units, which significantly exceeds the established 'summer decline' regime of ~19 units/week identified in late June. This surge resulted in a stockout (sold 70 of 104 demand). Because hoodies are out-of-season in July, this spike is likely either an outlier or a clearance-driven event rather than a sustained regime shift. However, since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time is consistently 0, I must replenish to cover safety stock against this increased volatility. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the average of the low-demand periods and the recent spike, which balances the risk of another surge against the high probability of a return to low summer demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for this recent high volatility (18, 19, 104). Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Unexpected demand surge in Period 21: Demand spiked to 104 units (July 1st) despite the established summer decline regime (~19 units), resulting in a stockout.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '715624001' (Becka hoodie) has entered an extremely volatile demand phase in early July (mid-summer). Despite the general expectation of low summer demand for hoodies, demand spiked significantly to 104 units in Period 21 and further accelerated to 201 units in Period 22, resulting in consecutive stockouts. This surge (July 1st and July 8th) suggests a major mid-summer sale event or a significant change in consumer behavior for this 'Basics' jersey product. Because actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period), I will set L to 'default'. To capture this rapid acceleration and mitigate further stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat to weight the current surge (avg ~152 per period) and setting an 'explicit' sigma_hat of 70 to provide a wider safety buffer for the OR engine, accounting for the massive jump from 104 to 201 units (+93%).

Carry-over insight: Significant mid-summer demand surge for jersey hoodies: Demand accelerated from ~19 units (late June) to 104 (P21) and 201 (P22), possibly indicating a seasonal clearance or mid-summer retail peak.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '715624001' (Becka hoodie) has entered a significant mid-summer demand surge. Demand increased from a baseline of ~19 units in late June to 104 (P21), 201 (P22), and 199 (P23). This 10x increase is sustained over three periods, indicating a clear regime shift potentially linked to a mid-summer clearance or localized trend. We are currently in Period 24 (July 22nd). Given the stability of the surge over the last two weeks (201 and 199 units), I will set mu_hat to reflect this high demand level. I am using recent_N with N=3 to capture the average of the surge (avg \u2248 168 units). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. This strategy aims to prevent further stockouts (which occurred in P21 and P22) while maintaining high service levels for this profitable hoodie ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Demand has shifted from a late-June baseline of ~19 units to a high-volume regime averaging ~168 units over Periods 21-23 (+780% increase).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24 (July 22), demand dropped significantly to 66 units, down from the mid-summer peak average of ~168 units observed in Periods 21-23. This suggests the high-volume surge (likely a summer clearance or promotion) has concluded. However, 66 units is still substantially higher than the late-June baseline of ~19 units. I will prioritize the most recent data to capture this downward transition. Using recent_N with N=4 includes the peak and the subsequent drop (201, 199, 66), plus the lead-in (104). The OR backend calculation for the base stock level (\u03bc + z*\u03c3) with current lead time L=0 will use this window to lower the order quantity, preventing overstocking as demand retreats, while maintaining a safety buffer in case the drop was an outlier. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge ended at Period 24: demand dropped from a 3-period average of 168 to 66 units (-60%), suggesting a transition out of the peak clearance/seasonal period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1945.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Becka hoodie is currently in a post-surge transition phase. After a massive mid-summer spike (reaching 201 units), demand fell to 66 in Period 24 but rebounded to 110 in Period 25. This suggests that while the absolute peak has passed, late-summer demand remains significantly higher and more volatile than the early-summer 'lull' of ~19 units. Given the date (August 5th), we are likely entering the 'Back to School' season, which historically drives demand for hoodies and basics. The last two periods (66, 110) average 88 units. I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture this post-surge level while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 145, setting parameters based on this recent average allows the OR backend to maintain a buffer for potential August volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs if demand tapers toward autumn.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand (Late July/Early August) has stabilized at a higher level than the June lull: Average demand for Periods 24-25 is 88 units, compared to the previous 'lull' of 19 units, likely driven by early 'Back to School' activity.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Becka hoodie has experienced a significant 'Back to School' spike, jumping from 110 units in Period 25 to 208 units in Period 26. This confirms the 'post-surge' stabilization mentioned in Carry-over Insights was actually the beginning of a larger autumn ramp-up. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). Given the date (August 12th) and product type (brushed jersey hoodie), demand is entering its peak seasonal window. I am shifting the mu_hat to reflect this high-demand regime using the last 3 samples (Periods 24-26: 66, 110, 208) which average ~128 units, but given the trajectory, I expect Period 27 to remain high. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this acceleration while maintaining the lead_time (L) as 'calculate' since history shows a consistent 0-period delivery.

Carry-over insight: Back to School demand spike confirmed: Demand increased from 66 to 208 units over 3 periods (late July to early August), indicating a transition into the autumn peak regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 715624001 (Becka hoodie) has entered its autumn peak, driven by 'Back to School' activity and seasonal cooling. Demand has surged significantly over the last two periods, increasing from 208 (P26) to 322 (P27), representing a 55% week-over-week increase and a clear regime shift into high-volume peak demand. We have experienced stockouts in both Period 26 and Period 27 due to this rapid acceleration. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on Period 27's successful same-period arrival. To mitigate further stockouts during this peak, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to 350, anticipating continued high demand as we move deeper into August. Sigma_hat is set to 80 using 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the high volatility observed during this transition into the autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime shift: Demand has surged from 110 (P25) to 322 (P27), confirming the start of the primary autumn/winter hoodie season with high volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late August 'Back to School' peak, which is a major demand driver for jersey hoodies. Demand history shows a massive surge in Period 27 (322 units), followed by a pullback to 83 units in Period 28. This high volatility is characteristic of the start of a seasonal peak. Period 28's low demand (83) likely represents a temporary pause before the September autumn peak begins. The 'Autumn peak regime shift' identified in Period 28 suggests demand will remain high and volatile. To avoid stockouts while managing the risk of the recent demand drop, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the high-volume regime of August (Periods 25-28: 110, 208, 322, 83), which averages ~181 units per week. This provides a robust base stock that accounts for the potential return of demand >300 units seen two weeks ago. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 715624001 (Becka hoodie) has transitioned from a sharp 'Back to School' peak (P26-P27, demand 208-322) into a consolidation phase (P28-P29, demand 83-63). Historically, hoodie demand in early September (current date 2019/9/2) often softens temporarily before the primary autumn/winter climb. Current on-hand inventory is 379 units, which is high relative to the last two weeks of demand, but justified given the upcoming cooler season. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the post-peak stabilization while maintaining a cautious buffer, as the autumn ramp-up is imminent. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the extreme volatility observed during the transition from peak demand to the current level. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School consolidation: Demand has retracted from a peak of 322 (Period 27) to an average of 73 units (Periods 28-29), a 77% decrease, marking a temporary lull before the autumn/winter season.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9th, 2019. We are in the post-Back-to-School consolidation phase where demand has settled from the August peak (322) to a more moderate level. Over the last three periods (P28-P30), demand was 83, 63, and 97, averaging 81 units. This confirms the 'Post-Back-to-School consolidation' insight. As we transition deeper into September, we expect demand for hoodies to gradually increase again with cooling autumn temperatures, though we are currently in a relative lull. On-hand inventory is 282 units with no orders in transit. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage current stock against the observed 81-unit average while preparing for potential seasonal upswings, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand regime. With an on-hand of 282 and a lead time of 0, the current inventory covers approximately 3.5 weeks of demand at the recent average, which is sufficient but warrants maintaining a proactive base stock as we enter late September.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand (late Aug/early Sept) stabilized at an average of 81 units (Periods 28-30), confirming a transition out of the August peak-season volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical data for this hoodie SKU shows significant volatility leading into mid-September. After a massive 'Back to School' peak in August (Period 27: 322 units), demand retracted to a 'consolidation phase' averaging ~81 units (Periods 28-30). However, Period 31 saw a sharp drop to 17 units. Given the \uc81c\ud488 (Product) category 'Hoodie' and the date (mid-September), we are entering the primary autumn sales window. While Period 31 was low, the seasonal expectation is for demand to climb as temperatures drop. Current on-hand inventory is 265 units. I will set mu_hat based on the post-peak average (N=4, Periods 28-31) which is approximately 65 units. This provides a baseline that respects the recent 'lull' while maintaining enough stock to cover a seasonal rebound. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the recent decrease in volatility compared to the August spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for the 'Becka hoodie' has significantly cooled following the August 'Back to School' peak, with the last two periods (P31-32) recording only 17 and 34 units respectively. However, we are entering late September, a time when autumn temperatures typically begin to drive sustained demand for fleece/sweatshirt products. The carry-over insights note a stabilization around 81 units post-peak, but the immediate trend is lower (avg ~25 units over the last 2 periods). I am adjusting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 28-32) which averages ~59 units per period. This captures the post-peak lull while remaining sensitive to the expected seasonal uptick in October. On-hand inventory is currently 231 units, which is ample to cover several weeks of demand at the current rate (approx 4-5 weeks of coverage). As the lead time is 0, the OR backend will correctly see that no new orders are required until inventory levels align more closely with the base stock calculated from this updated mu_hat and sigma_hat. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand lull deepened in mid-September (Periods 31-32) with demand dropping to an average of 25.5 units, significantly below the previous late-August consolidation of 81 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. We are in the post-Back-to-School phase moving into October. Historical demand over the last 6 periods (late August to late September) has show significant fluctuation (83, 63, 97, 17, 34, 84), averaging approximately 63 units/week. While there was a 'lull' in mid-September (Periods 31-32), Period 33 demand recovered to 84 units, suggesting the lull was temporary or seasonal volatility. As this is a hoodie, we anticipate demand to climb as we enter autumn/winter. On-hand inventory is 147 units with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 0, our inventory level currently covers about 2.3 weeks of the recent average demand. To prepare for the upcoming seasonal rise while managing the current high volatility, I will use a shorter window (recent_N where N=6) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the post-BTS stabilization and the recent upward tick in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Mid-September demand lull ended at Period 33: demand recovered from an average of 25.5 (P31-32) to 84 units, suggesting a return to the post-BTS baseline of ~60-80 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7th, 2019. We are moving deeper into the autumn season, which is favorable for hoodie sales. The 'Back to School' peak (Aug) has subsided and stabilized into a post-BTS baseline. Over the last two periods (P33 and P34), demand has risen from a mid-September lull (~25 units) to an average of 91 units (P33: 84, P34: 98). This suggests a transition back to the baseline observed in late August. On-hand inventory is currently 49 units, which is insufficient to cover one period of the current demand level (~90+). The promised lead time is 0 and historical lead times consistently show 0, so I will maintain L=0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent recovery from the September lull (average of P32-P34 is 72 units), ensuring the OR engine orders enough to replenish stock for the current upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Post-lull recovery confirmed in late September/early October: Demand increased from an average of 25.5 (P31-32) to 91 (P33-34), signaling a return to the autumn baseline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/14. We have entered the peak autumn season for the Becka hoodie. Demand has shown a significant upward trend over the last three periods: 84 (P33), 98 (P34), and 131 (P35), confirmng the transition out of the September lull and into a high-demand regime. We currenty have 0 units on-hand after a slight stockout in Period 35 (demand was 131, we only had 128 available). The promised lead time continues to be 0 and has been consistently met. To capture the current upward momentum and avoid further stockouts during this seasonal peak, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to specifically capture the last three weeks of growth (average ~104 units). For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=3 to reflect the recent variance as we scale up. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the rising seasonal uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand acceleration confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods from 84 (P33) to 131 (P35), indicating a move into the high-volume late-October/November season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2195.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Becka hoodie is entering the peak autumn/winter season (late October). Over the last four periods (33-36), demand has shown a clear upward trend (84, 98, 131, 117), averaging 107.5 units. This is a significant increase from the mid-September lull of ~25 units. While Period 36 showed a slight drop from 131 to 117, it remains consistently high compared to the previous regime. Given the product category and the date (Oct 21), further acceleration is expected as temperatures drop. I will use a conservative recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this autumn baseline (~108 units per period). Due to the high volatility seen during peak periods (e.g., the August BTS peak), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 40 to ensure a sufficient service level and avoid the stockouts experienced in Period 35. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand acceleration confirmed: Demand averaged 107.5 units over Periods 33-36, establishing a high-volume regime for the late-October/November season.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the late-autumn hoodie season. Historical demand shows a clear acceleration: Demand in the last four periods was 98, 131, 117, and 160 units (avg 126.5), confirming the high-volume regime identified in carry-over insights. Total on-hand inventory is low (14 units) with 0 in-transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, ensuring same-period replenishment. To maintain service levels during this growth phase, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current 126.5 average and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility (std ~26). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand spike for late October/early November.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand growth confirmed: Demand accelerated from a mid-September average of 25.5 to a late-October average of 126.5 units (+396%) over the last 6 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the peak autumn/winter season for hoodies. Demand has been accelerating since mid-September. Over the last 6 periods (P33-P38), demand has averaged 112 units (84, 98, 131, 117, 160, 93). While Period 38 saw a slight dip to 93, the overall trend remains high compared to the September lull (~25 units). The actual lead time consistently confirms a 0-period delivery (arrived same period). With on-hand inventory at 77 and an expected mean demand of ~112 units, we need a safety stock buffer to handle the high volatility (sigma) observed in this season (std dev of last 6 periods is approx 27). I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volume autumn regime while ignoring the September outliers. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand and historical variance of the current growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand high-volume regime confirmed: Average demand for Periods 33-38 is ~112 units, compared to the mid-September lull of ~26 units (+330%).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the peak hoodie season (Autumn/Winter). Over the last seven periods (P33-P39), demand has shifted from a mid-September lull to a high-volume regime, averaging 94.8 units/week. More specifically, the last five weeks (P35-P39) show a sustained high-volume average of 116.4 units. While demand retracted slightly in the last two weeks (93 and 81 units) from the P37 peak of 160 units, we must maintain a high base stock to prevent stockouts during late autumn volatility. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime performance while allowing for the slight recent cooling; N=5 covers P35-P39. This balances the risk of stockouts during seasonal peaks against excessive holding costs as we move further into November.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the peak autumn/winter season for the Becka hoodie. Demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime, with recent observations being 160, 93, 81, and 104 units (Periods 37-40). The average demand over these last 4 periods is 109.5 units. While there was a slight dip in Periods 38-39, Period 40 shows a recovery to 104 units. Given that we are approaching late November (traditionally a high-demand period for sweatshirts), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 8-period average (capturing the full autumn acceleration from Period 33 onwards) to ensure enough stock for potential spikes while accounting for recent stabilization. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. sigma_hat will also be calculated using the recent 8 periods to reflect the current seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-volume regime stabilized: Average demand for Periods 33-40 is ~108 units/week, confirming a sustained seasonal baseline for the late-year peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the heart of the autumn/winter retail season for sweatshirts/hoodies. Demand over the last 9 periods (since Period 33) has established a stable high-volume regime with a mean of approximately 107 units per week (98, 131, 117, 160, 93, 81, 104, 95). While there is some week-to-week volatility, the average has remained remarkably consistent. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the regime is stable and we are entering the peak holiday shopping period (Black Friday/Cyber Monday week), I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this established autumn/winter baseline. This ensures \u03bc\u0302 reflects the ~107 unit mean and \u03c3\u0302 accounts for the observed seasonal volatility, maintaining a high service level for the $19 profit margin while managing the $1 holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2nd, entering the peak winter season for hoodies. Historical demand for this 'Becka hoodie' showed a surge in early February (up to 302 units in the first year's data), suggesting that as we move deeper into December and January, demand will likely increase from the current baseline. Over the last 10 periods (P33-P42), demand has averaged 110.9 units. However, given the seasonal category (hoodie) and the upcoming peak winter weeks, I will use a shorter window (recent_N with N=5) to capture the late November acceleration (P42 demand was 148, significantly above the 10-period average). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that accounts for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95% service level) and the anticipated seasonal climb.

Carry-over insight: Early December regime: Demand is accelerating into the winter peak, with Period 42 reaching 148 units, well above the previous 8-week average of ~108.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, and we are in the peak winter season for the 'Becka hoodie'. Demand has been highly volatile but generally elevated, with an average of ~102 units over the last 11 periods (P33-P43). While Period 43 saw a drop to 65 units, Period 42 was much higher (148), and we must anticipate the 'Holiday' shopping rush in mid-December. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To capture both the recent average and protect against peak-season spikes, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand with N=11 (covering the established autumn/winter regime) and use 'recent_N' for volatility to account for the frequent demand swings observed since October.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing the high-volume winter peak for hoodies. Historical demand over the last 10 periods (P35-P44) has an average of ~108 units, but volatility is high due to the season, with recent demand fluctuating between 65 and 148 units. Period 42 showed a significant pre-holiday spike (148 units). As we approach the final weeks of December, demand is expected to remain elevated or potentially spike further for Christmas/New Year sales. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am setting L to default (0). I will use a mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current late-autumn/winter regime (~108 units/week), while using sigma_hat over the same N=10 period to account for the increased volatility (std dev ~33). This produces a base stock level that cushions against another Period 42-style spike without excessive overstocking as we approach the end of the game (P47).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019 (Period 46). Demand in Period 45 spiked to 233 units, confirming a significant pre-Christmas/Winter peak surge for hoodies, which significantly exceeded the previous 5-period average of ~92 units and wiped out all on-hand inventory. Given this clear holiday peak, I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this higher volume regime. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period. Since we are entering the final high-volume week of the year and are currently at zero stock, I will set mu_hat to 233 to prevent further stockouts during this critical peak, and use recent demand volatility (N=4) to set sigma_hat, as the standard deviation has widened alongside the volume increase.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: High-volume winter holiday peak confirmed: Demand surged to 233 units in Period 45, a 150% increase over the previous late-autumn baseline of ~92 units, resulting in a stockout.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the end of December (Period 47, Dec 30). Historical data for this hoodie SKU shows that demand in Period 45 (233 units) and Period 46 (214 units) represents the peak holiday season. As we enter January, retail patterns typically show a significant seasonal cooling for autumn/winter garments after the end-of-year clearance and gifting period. Looking at the start of the simulation (February 2019), demand was around 131 units, which then tapered to ~50 units by March. Period 46 saw a slight decrease from Period 45 (214 vs 233). I expect a continued decline toward the post-holiday baseline. However, to avoid another stockout like Period 45, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P44-P46 average = (90+233+214)/3 = 179) to maintain a buffer, while using a recent_N sigma to capture the high holiday volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand decline initiated: Demand decreased from 233 (P45) to 214 (P46), suggesting the winter peak has passed and demand is beginning to revert toward early-year levels (~131 units).
