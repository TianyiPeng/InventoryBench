Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 685816001 (Men's Basic Jersey Round-necked T-shirt). The current date is February 11, 2019. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks ranges from 33 to 56, with a mean of 42.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 8.9. Since basic t-shirts have relatively stable demand and there are no immediate seasonal spikes expected in mid-February, I will use the recent history to set parameters. The promised lead time is 0. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering all available history) to capture the current demand regime. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using the unit profit ($19.0) and holding cost ($1.0), resulting in a high service level (0.95), which is appropriate for a basic staple item with low holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 58 units which arrived immediately (lead time 0). However, demand was 88 units, resulting in 30 units of lost sales and ending the period with 0 on-hand inventory. The available historical demand samples (36, 56, 33, 45, 42) have a mean of 42.4. Comparing this to the observed demand of 88 in Period 1 suggests a significant upward shift or a seasonal spike for this basic jersey T-shirt. Given the product is a 'Jersey Basic' and it's mid-February, we may be seeing the start of spring demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to prioritize the most recent observed demand (88) to avoid further stockouts, while keeping L=0 as confirmed by the Period 1 conclusion.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816001 (Men's Round-necked T-shirt) has exhibited two distinct demand spikes significantly higher than the initial historical data (mean ~42). Demand in Period 1 was 88 and in Period 2 was 113. This suggest a high-growth regime or seasonality not fully captured in the early samples. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (arrived same period), confirming the promised lead time. I will use recent_N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent high demand periods more heavily. Since L=0, mu_hat should cover (1+0) periods. The average of the last two periods [88, 113] is 100.5. I'll use method 'recent_N' with N=2 to allow the backend to catch this upward trend while maintaining some variance awareness.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2470.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a Men's basic round-neck T-shirt. Observed demand for Period 1-3 (88, 113, 135) shows a clear upward trend and is significantly higher than the initial historical data (avg ~42). The historical samples (36, 56, 33, 45, 42) are no longer representative. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since demand is currently accelerating (averaging 112 over the last 3 periods with a peak of 135), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this higher volume and volatility. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that accounts for the trend and protects against the increasing demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected from Period 1: local average (112) is ~160% higher than initial historical context (~42). Lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1509.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816001 (Men's Basic Jersey T-shirt) has exhibited a significant demand shift. Initial historical data suggested a mean of ~42, but observations from Period 1-4 show a drastically higher mean demand of 104.75 units (88, 113, 135, 83). The current date is mid-March (spring), often a period for replenishing basics. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. The OR engine calculates base stock as base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat. With L=0, mu_hat should reflect the expected demand for the upcoming period. Given the recent variability\u2014high demand peaks followed by a slight dip in Period 4\u2014I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current state while smoothing the Period 3 peak and Period 4 drop. sigma_hat will also be set via 'recent_N' to reflect this current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1235.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic cotton T-shirt, which typically has stable demand unless affected by seasonal shifts. Historical samples (Jan-early Feb) showed a mean demand of ~42. Starting from Period 1 (mid-Feb), demand spiked significantly to an average of ~98 (88, 113, 135, 83, 69). Periods 4 and 5 show a slight cooling from the initial spike but remain much higher than the initial historical data. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all 5 completed periods. I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current active regime (Period 1 to Period 5), which averages 97.6 units. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough for the current mid-to-late winter/early spring market in 2019, while the z-score (q=0.95) from profit/holding cost logic handles the stockout risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $999.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. Based on the product description (Basic Round-necked T-shirt) and historical data, we initially saw a sharp demand spike in late February/early March (Periods 1-3, avg ~112), likely a seasonal 'spring basics' lift or promotion. However, demand in the last three periods (P4-P6: 83, 69, 57) has shown a clear decelerating trend, averaging 69.7 units. The Lead Time is consistently 0. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this recent lower-demand regime using N=3 to stabilize around the current sales velocity. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to capture recent volatility. On-hand is 84, which is sufficient if demand continues to drop, but the OR backend needs updated parameters to avoid over-ordering as we enter late March.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction observed from Period 4: Mean demand reduced from ~112 (P1-P3) to ~70 (P4-P6), a 37.5% decrease.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 685816001 (Men's Cotton T-shirt) showed an initial spike in February (Periods 1-3, avg ~112) followed by a stabilization/contraction in March (Periods 4-7, avg ~66). The most recent four periods (P4-P7) show demand of 83, 69, 57, and 55, indicating a downward trend toward a stable spring baseline. Current on-hand inventory is 37 units. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (critical given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the more recent demand regime (mean ~66) rather than the volatile early February peak. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Historical demand for this basic cotton round-neck T-shirt shows significant shifts: an initial spike in February (Periods 1-3, avg ~112), a contraction in March (Periods 4-7, avg ~66), and a recent jump in Period 8 (demand=104). The Period 8 demand increase likely reflects a pre-Easter or early spring shopping surge, as T-shirts begin to see higher volume with warmer weather. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 8. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To capture the recent upward movement while remaining responsive to the lower baseline observed in March, I will use a recent window of 5 periods (Periods 4-8), which averages ~74 units. Given the stockout and the seasonal transition into April, I'll set mu_hat to cover this demand level plus safety stock. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent regime more heavily than the high-volatility start of the year.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected starting Period 8: Demand increased to 104 from a P4-P7 average of 66, signaling a seasonal shift or promotional impact.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The product is a Men's Jersey T-shirt. Historical lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Demand has shown significant volatility: an initial high (P1-P3 avg ~112), a contraction (P4-P7 avg ~66), and a recent sharp rebound. In Period 9, demand spiked to 187, significantly exceeding the order of 108 and resulting in a stockout. This spike aligns with the onset of spring, where demand for basic jersey t-shirts typically increases. Given the stockout in P8 and P9, and the jump from 104 to 187, we are in a high-demand regime. Using the last 2 periods as the basis for the next forecast is appropriate to capture this seasonal momentum while preventing over-ordering based on a single outlier. Average demand P8-P9 is 145.5. I will set mu_hat to cover this expected demand (1+L=1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Demand spiked to 187 units (+80% vs P8), confirming a strong seasonal uptrend for basic T-shirts in April.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The inventory is at 145 units with none in transit. Lead time remains consistently 0. Historical demand shows a significant spike in early April (P9: 187), followed by a pullback to 98 in P10. This volatility is common for 'Jersey Basic' round-necked T-shirts as the weather warms up. Given the mismatch between P9 and P10, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 (covering P8-P10: 104, 187, 98) to capture the current elevated seasonal level (average ~130) without overreacting solely to the P9 outlier. This balances the risk of stockouts during the spring uptrend against the holding cost of excess basic inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. We are managing a basic cotton crew-neck T-shirt, which is currently in a high-demand spring/summer seasonal phase. Historically, demand has been volatile but trending upward in April: P1-P7 average was ~86, while P8-P11 average increased to ~136. Recent demand values (104, 187, 98, 156) show significant weekly variance (std dev ~41). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this high-activity regime while accounting for the high volatility, I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated seasonal average (~136 units) plus a safety buffer for the current volatility, maximizing profit given the high 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a jersey cotton round-neck T-shirt, which is showing seasonal demand growth as we enter May. Historical lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all 12 prior periods. Demand in the most recent five periods (P8-P12) shows a significant volatile uptrend compared to March, with values of 104, 187, 98, 156, and 148. The mean of these last 5 samples is 138.6 units. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and the significant volatility (standard deviation ~34) while moving away from early-year low demand values. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 8: Mean demand for Men's Jersey T-shirts increased from ~66 (P4-P7) to ~139 (P8-P12), reflecting seasonal spring/summer growth.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are in a high-demand seasonal regime for Men's Jersey T-shirts. The demand since Period 8 has averaged approximately 131 units (104, 187, 98, 156, 148, 94). Although Period 13 saw a lower demand of 94, the overall trend since April (Period 8) remains significantly higher than the February-March period. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the growth regime since Period 8) to capture the current mean demand of ~131. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to account for the increased volatility (std \u2248 35) observed during this spring/summer uptrend compared to the steadier historical context.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816001 (Men's Jersey T-shirt) is in a high-demand seasonal regime (Spring/Summer), which began around Period 8 (early April). The mean demand since that shift (P8-P14) is approximately 132 units per week, significantly higher than the early spring slump (~66 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 15 (May 20), I will target the current regime's higher demand while allowing for the volatility observed in this period (demand range 94 to 187). Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) captures the seasonal mean (~132) multiplied by (1+L), and the sigma_hat reflects the standard deviation of this higher-volatility period. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that minimizes stockouts during this peak season while accounting for 'Jersey Basic' demand variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2750.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Men's Jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its peak spring/summer seasonal regime. Demand significantly increased starting Period 8 (April 1st). Over the last 8 periods (P8-P15), the average demand is approximately 134 units (104, 187, 98, 156, 148, 94, 137, 147), which is a sustained shift compared to earlier periods. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true across all 15 periods. For Period 16, I will use a recent_N approach with N=8 to capture this elevated demand regime and its associated volatility. This ensures 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' reflect the current seasonal level (approx 134/week), allowing the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock level (around 160-170 units) to cover the current period's demand while avoiding stockouts that have occurred four times during the season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3572.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816001 (Men's Basic Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand seasonal phase (Late Spring/Early Summer). Period 16 saw a demand of 199, which is a record high for this season. The demand regime from Period 8 to 16 averages ~141 units per period, with significant volatility (high of 199, low of 94). In Period 16, because on-hand inventory was insufficient (188 vs 199), 11 units of demand were lost, leaving the system with 0 on-hand inventory for Period 17. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this peak seasonal period, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=9, covering the Period 8-16 regime) to capture the current mean of 141.1 multiplied by (1+L), and sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=9) to capture the high recent volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level appropriate for the $19.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in May/June: Period 16 reached a record seasonal high of 199 units (up from Period 8-15 avg of 134), resulting in a stockout. High-demand regime remains active.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. This SKU (Men's Jersey T-shirt) is in a high-demand seasonal regime for late spring/early summer. Over the last 10 periods (P8-P17), the mean demand has risen significantly to approximately 137.4 units per week, with a recent peak of 199 in P16 causing a stockout. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded history. My strategy is to capture this elevated demand state while accounting for the recent increase in volatility. I will use the last 10 samples (representing the seasonal shift that began in April) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a high service level appropriate for a high-margin product ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) while preventing excessive inventory as we approach the potential peak or plateau of the summer season.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816001 (Men's Cotton Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime consistent with the summer season in June. Demand since Period 8 has averaged approximately 137 units per week, with significant volatility (high of 199, low of 94). The most recent period (P18) showed demand of 128 units, which aligns with this high-demand context. Analysis of the history confirms a reliable lead time of 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use the last 11 periods (P8 to P18) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the specific seasonal shift that occurred in early April. Applying recent_N (N=11) ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers this high-volume period while accounting for the recent increase in variability observed in May/June, minimizing stockout risk while maintaining efficient inventory levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3724.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we are in the peak summer season for Men's Jersey T-shirts. Demand remains high and volatile, with Period 19 recording 201 units and resulting in another stockout. The demand regime from Period 8 onwards (spring/summer) shows an average demand of approximately 149 units per week, compared to the earlier spring average of ~66. In the last 4 periods (P16-P19), the volatility has increased further, with demand spikes reaching ~200. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand summer period while accounting for the recent increase in variance, I am setting L to default (0). I will use the last 12 periods (P8 to P19) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand seasonal regime (~149/period) and the last 12 periods for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (std dev ~35). This ensures a high service level during the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: High-demand summer regime remains active as of P19: average demand desde P8 is ~149 units, with significant spikes around 200 units producing frequent stockouts.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Jersey Basic T-shirt (Men's Underwear), facing high summer demand as of Period 21 (July 1st). Demand has consistently hovered near or above 200 units in recent periods (P16: 199, P19: 201, P20: 216), leading to frequent stockouts (ending inventory 0 in 3 of the last 5 periods). The current average demand since the seasonal shift (P8 to P20) is 149 units, but the last 3-period average is higher at 181.67. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent history. I will use recent_N (N=13, covering the P8-P20 summer regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we capture the current high volatility and volume while also reflecting the specific upward pressure from the late June/early July peak. The high profit margin relative to holding cost ($19 vs $1) dictates a high service level, supporting aggressive stocking to prevent further lost sales during this peak seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand summer regime (P8-P20) average is 149; peak period (P19-P20) demand has accelerated to ~208 units, consistently causing stockouts when on-hand inventory is insufficient.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019, which is peak summer season for basic cotton T-shirts. We are in a high-demand regime that started around Period 8 (April) and has intensified significantly from Period 16 onwards. Recent demand (P19-P21) shows a cluster around 200 units (201, 216, 158), with stockouts occurring whenever start-of-period inventory is near or below 200. The average demand since Period 16 is 174.2, and since Period 19 it is 191.6. To avoid further stockouts during this high-velocity summer peak, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect this higher mean. I choose 205 as the based stock target (mu_hat for L=0) because it covers the recent peak of 216 (incorporating historical volatility) while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $19 profit margin. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816001 (Men's Cotton T-shirt) is in a high-demand summer regime. Period 22 showed a demand of 108 units following a peak of 158-216 units in Periods 19-21. While the most recent sample is lower, the broader summer regime (Period 8 to present) maintains an average demand of approximately 144 units with high volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 157 units. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts which have occurred recently (P16, P19, P20) while accounting for the high reward/low holding cost ratio, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 15 periods (since the seasonal shift in Period 8) to capture the current summer demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to provide enough safety stock for the frequent spikes observed in this category.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are managing a basic jersey round-neck T-shirt, which is a seasonal summer item. Historical data showed a significant demand surge starting in late spring (Period 8/April), peaking between Periods 16-21 (June/early July) with average demand around 150-200 units and frequent stockouts. However, the last two periods (P22 and P23) have shown a noticeable cooling in demand, with values of 108 and 99 respectively. This likely signals the start of the late-summer wind-down as peak vacation shopping subsides. While the 'summer regime' was very strong, the recent N approach (N=3) reflects the most current trend (avg ~122) while still acknowledging the volatility (sigma). I will use recent_N=3 to capture this pivot quickly while maintaining a moderately high base stock to prevent late-season stockouts if demand spikes again before August.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed from Period 22: Mean demand dropped from a peak summer average of ~150 (P8-P21) to ~104 (P22-P23), indicating the beginning of the post-peak summer cooling trend.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal cycle for this Men's Jersey T-shirt. We experienced a high-demand summer regime from early April (Period 9) through June (Period 21), where demand consistently averaged ~150-200 units. However, starting in Period 22 (July 8), demand has decelerated into a lower regime, with the last three periods (P22-P24) recording 108, 99, and 102 units respectively (average 103). This confirms the post-peak cooling trend noted in the previous carry-over. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this cooling phase while maintaining a buffer for late-summer volatility, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (target avg ~103) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the current lower variance. On-hand inventory is 72, and there is no pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed (P22-P24): Mean demand has stabilized at ~103 units, down ~31% from the summer peak average of ~150.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in early August (2019/8/5). Historical demand shows a confirmed cooling trend starting around Period 22 (early July). The high summer peak (avg ~150) has subsided to a new, lower regime. Demand for the last 4 periods (P22-P25) has been 108, 99, 102, and 79. The most recent observation (79) suggests potential further deceleration as we transition out of peak summer. However, to avoid stockouts if demand stabilizes, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this 'post-peak' regime which averages approximately 97 units per period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent 4-period window provides the most accurate reflection of the current seasonal shift.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/08/12). Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 22, demand has transitioned from a high summer peak (~150+ units) to a cooling late-summer regime. The last five periods (P22-P26) show demand values of 108, 99, 102, 79, and 65, which results in a local average of approximately 90.6 units. This confirms the downward trend noted in previous insights. Given the product is a jersey basic T-shirt, further tapering is expected as the season transitions from summer to fall. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering this cooldown phase) to capture the lower demand mean, and default for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against remaining summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: Late-summer cooling confirmed with mean demand dropping to ~91 units (P22-P26), down from peak summer average of ~150.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical data and recent carry-over insights indicate a significant demand regime shift occurring around Period 22 (early July), where the peak summer demand (avg ~150) dropped to a late-summer/early-autumn cooling phase. For the last six periods (P22-P27), demand values were 108, 99, 102, 79, 65, and 87, resulting in a mean of approximately 90 units. This transition from summer peaks to a more stable, lower demand level is consistent with seasonal patterns for jersey T-shirts. The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time has consistently remained 0 throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 88 units and the stabilized demand around 90, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this post-peak regime while maintaining adequate service levels to avoid stockouts if small fluctuations occur.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are in a post-peak summer cooling regime for Men's Jersey T-shirts. Since Period 22 (early July), demand has shifted from a summer peak average of ~150 to a lower average of ~91 units (P22-P28). The most recent demand was 110, which is slightly higher than the cooling-regime mean but remains significantly below the summer high. On-hand inventory is very low at 7 units. Given the 0-period lead time, I will set mu_hat based on the recent cooling trend (N=7, covering P22-P28) to avoid overstocking as we exit the summer season, while maintaining enough stock for potential volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime's mean and volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Historical demand for this men's jersey t-shirt has transitioned from a high-demand summer peak (P8-P21, avg ~150) to a stabilized late-summer/early-autumn regime. Demand from Period 22 to Period 29 has averaged approximately 93.5 units (sample values: 108, 99, 102, 79, 65, 87, 110, 98), with recent fluctuations between 65 and 110. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while holding enough for potential late-season spikes (like the 110 seen in P28), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this specific post-peak regime. This N covers the period from P22 forward.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-summer: Mean demand for P22-P29 is ~94 units, a 37% reduction from the summer peak average of 150.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Men's Jersey T-shirt, which experienced peak demand during the summer months (P8-P21 average ~150 units). Since Period 22 (early July), demand has undergone a sustained deceleration as the season transitions towards autumn. The demand regime from P22 to P30 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 93 units per period. The most recent demand (P30: 90 units) is consistent with this 'post-summer' regime. I will use a recent_N (N=9) approach to capture the mean and variance of this current stabilizing regime (P22-P30). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals in historical conclude messages.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816001 (Men's Cotton T-shirt) has transitioned from its peak summer demand regime (~150 units/period) into a stable post-summer regime. Since Period 22 (July 8), demand has consistently averaged around 93 units. Most recently, from Period 28 to 31, demand has been very stable (110, 98, 90, 89), specifically averaging 92 units over the last 4 periods. The lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To maintain optimal service levels while avoiding excessive holding costs in this lower-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 10-period window (N=10) to capture the current stable state (averaging ~92.7 units) while still being slightly protected against the recent volatility seen in Period 28. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the reduced variability compared to the high-summer period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Jersey Basic T-shirt. We are currently in late September (Period 33). Historically, the peak summer demand (approx. 150 units/period) cooled down starting in Period 22. For the most recent 11 periods (P22-P32), the demand has stabilized with a mean of 93.36 and a standard deviation of 15.6. The last three periods (P30-P32) show demand of 90, 89, and 70, reinforcing this lower-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=11 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized post-summer regime while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy potential variance, as the service level calculation (95% target given the high profit/holding cost ratio) will naturally favor slightly higher stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P22-P32) mean is ~93 units, stabilized after the summer peak (~150).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816001 (Men's Cotton T-shirt) has transitioned into a stable post-summer demand regime. Since Period 22 (July 8), the mean demand has significantly decreased and stabilized. For the last 12 periods (P22-P33), the average demand is ~93.4 units, compared to the summer peak average of ~150. Recent demand in P33 was slightly higher (110), but overall the trend is flat. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent history. Given the stability of this current regime, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=12 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this post-summer period. This will provide a reliable forecast (mu_hat) and safety stock (sigma_hat) to handle the observed variance (~16 units) while minimizing holding costs for this basic item.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The product is a Men's Basic Jersey T-shirt. Historical data showed a significant peak during summer (P8-P21, avg ~150) followed by a stabilization period starting at P22. From P22 to P34, the demand has averaged approximately 91.5 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P30-P34) show stable demand (90, 89, 70, 110, 83) with a mean of 88.4. There is no evidence of a further downward trend into autumn yet, so I will focus on this stable post-summer regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=13, covering the P22-P34 regime) for mean and volatility to reflect this current stable state (mu_hat approx 92, sigma_hat adjusted for the relative stability compared to summer peaks).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Jersey Basic Round-necked T-shirt' has transitioned into a stable post-summer regime. Since Period 22 (July), mean demand has settled into a lower, more consistent range compared to the summer peak. Analysis of the most recent 14 periods (P22-P35) shows a mean demand of 91.1 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (confirmed in P35 conclude). Given the product is a 'Basic' item, demand is expected to remain stable through mid-October before any potential late-year shifts. I will use N=14 to capture this stable autumn regime while excluding the high-volatility summer data. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that protects against the moderate observed variance (standard deviation of ~15) while avoiding the excess holding costs associated with the previous 150+ unit summer demand levels.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product is a Men's Jersey T-shirt. Historical data and recent demand signal a stabilized post-summer regime. Since Period 22 (July 8), the mean demand has shifted downwards from the summer peak (~150) to a more consistent fall average of approximately 90 units per period. Specifically, from P22 to P36 (15 periods), the mean demand is 89.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 15.6. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 55 units. I will use the recent_N method with N=15 to capture this stable post-summer regime (P22-P36) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this period length is sufficient to represent the current seasonal baseline and volatility without being skewed by the higher summer demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the post-summer stable demand regime for 'Jersey Basic Round-necked T-shirts', which are staple items but experience lower demand in late autumn compared to the summer peak. Analysis of the most recent data (Period 22 to 37) shows a consistent mean demand of approximately 91.5 units, significantly lower than the ~150 units observed during mid-summer. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 37 units. Using 'recent_N' with N=16 (covering P22-P37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will accurately capture this stabilized lower demand profile and its associated volatility while filtering out the irrelevant summer peak. This approach ensures safety stock levels are appropriately adjusted for the current seasonal baseline, preventing overstocking as we move further into the cold season.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-04 (Period 39). The product is a basic Men's Jersey T-shirt. Historical data from Period 22 onwards shows a stable demand regime following the summer peak. For the last 17 periods (P22-P38), the mean demand has been approximately 89.8 units (std ~14.6). The latest lead time observation confirms L=0. In the most recent 10 periods (P29-P38), the average demand is 85.4 units, reflecting a slight continued cooling as we enter November. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this late-autumn stabilization while providing enough variance coverage. The high profit margin relative to holding cost ($19 vs $1) justifies maintaining a healthy safety stock to prevent stockouts, which were frequent during the summer peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product is a Men's Basic T-shirt, which has moved out of its peak summer demand regime (avg ~150) into a stabilized post-summer regime. Since Period 22 (July 8), demand has averaged approximately 90 units per period. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P32-P39) have shown a consistent mean of 83.8 units with lower volatility (std ~16) compared to the summer months. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current stable, lower-demand regime while maintaining a tight service level, especially as we approach potential year-end holiday shifts.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P22-P39) stabilized with a mean of ~89 units. Most recent window (P32-P39) shows further cooling to ~84 units per period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical demand for this jersey basic T-shirt has stabilized into a post-summer regime. The carry_over_insights noted a mean demand of ~89 units for periods P22-P39. However, the most recent observation in Period 40 shows a significant drop to 30 units, which may be a transient outlier or the start of a further winter cooling trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overreacting to the single low data point in Period 40 while acknowledging the gradual softening observed since P32 (mean ~84), I will use a recent_N window of 9 periods (P32-P40) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the latest cooling trend (~78 units average) without completely disregarding the established baseline. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand and volatility for the current period, adjusting for the 78 units already on hand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are observing a significant demand deceleration in November compared to the previous 'post-summer' regime. Specifically, the last two periods (P40, P41) show demand has dropped to 30 and 38 units, significantly lower than the P22-P39 average of 89. This aligns with seasonal expectations for a 'Jersey Basic' Men's T-shirt as the weather turns colder in late November. The previous cooling trend mentioned in the Period 40 Carry-Over Insight (avg ~84) is now obsolete; a new lower-demand regime is emerging. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to quickly capture this downward shift (P39-P41 average is ~44), while maintaining a slightly higher N for sigma_hat to account for lingering volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 40: Mean demand dropped from ~89 (P22-P39) to ~34 (P40-P41), a ~60% decrease, likely due to late-autumn seasonality for basic T-shirts.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand spike occurred in Period 42 (150 units), contrasting sharply with the previous two periods of low demand (P40: 30, P41: 38). This spike likely corresponds to Black Friday/Cyber Monday week (late November 2019), a period of extreme retail volatility. My inventory was depleted, resulting in a stockout. For Period 43 (early December), I must decide if this was a one-off outlier or the start of a sustained holiday demand regime. Given the product is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt', it is a common gift item and core staple that sees elevated demand throughout December. I will increase mu_hat using a recent_N (N=3) approach to capture the weighted influence of the recent spike (averaging ~73 units over the last 3 periods) while acknowledging that demand is higher than the autumn lull. I will explicitly set sigma_hat to a high value to account for the extreme variance observed during this promotional/holiday window, ensuring the OR backend targets a safer base stock.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility detected: Period 42 spike to 150 units (+300% vs P40-41 average) indicates high sensitivity to late-year retail events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (2019/12/09), which is the post-Cyber Monday period. History shows a massive demand spike in Period 42 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday week) where demand hit 150 units, followed by a sharp drop to 46 units in Period 43. This follows the late-autumn regime (P40-P41 avg ~34) but includes holiday volatility. Given the date, demand is likely to remain in the low-regime range (approx 30-50 units) as we move toward the end of the year, although some pre-Christmas gift shopping is possible. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand (126) is currently sufficient to cover over 2 periods of the low-regime demand, but we need to maintain a baseline to handle any mini-spikes. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the P40-P43 average (~66) which blends the low baseline with the holiday spike, ensuring we don't over-order while recovering from the P42 stockout.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility spike confirmed: Period 42 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) demand reached 150 units, followed by a correction to 46 units in Period 43. Baseline regime remains low (~35-45 units).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a lower baseline demand regime typical of the post-holiday/late-autumn season for basic T-shirts. Period 42 showed a significant holiday-driven spike (150 units), but demand has since corrected back to a low baseline (P43: 46 units, P44: 49 units). The current context (mid-December) sits between the late-November peaks and the end-of-year clearance or pre-spring baseline. As confirmed in carry-over insights, the baseline demand after the autumn cooling (P40-P41) was around 30-40 units. Recent observations P43-P44 suggest a stabilize-at-baseline phase (~47.5 mean). I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the mix of the holiday spike and the subsequent stabilization, providing enough buffer for any late-December residual volume while acknowledging the lower seasonal baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December (Period 46, Dec 23rd). Recent demand history shows a low late-autumn baseline (~35-40) punctuated by holiday volatility: Period 42 (Black Friday) saw 150 units, and Period 45 (just before Christmas) saw another jump to 107 units. Since Period 46 covers the Christmas week, I expect elevated demand similar to Period 45 or slightly higher due to last-minute shopping, followed by a post-holiday drop. The baseline regime (P40-P44, excluding P42) is ~40 units, but the last period (P45) was 107. To avoid a stockout during the peak Christmas week while accounting for the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), I will set mu_hat to 120 (reflecting a sustained holiday peak for the current week) and use an explicit sigma_hat of 45 to handle the known volatility seen in P42 and P45. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Christmas holiday spike detected: Period 45 demand reached 107 units, confirming a secondary December peak after the initial Black Friday (P42) surge.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 47 (Dec 30), which covers the New Year transition. Historical data shows two distinct holiday spikes: Period 42 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) at 150 units and Period 45 (Christmas lead-up) at 107 units. Period 46 saw demand settle to 84 units. As the holiday urgency subsides, demand typically reverts toward the late-autumn baseline (approx. 35-45 units), though a minor New Year's lift is possible. Given the high profit margin ($19) vs holding cost ($1), a high service level is maintained. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat (covering the entire holiday period P40-P46) which results in an average demand of approx 72 units. This provides a safe buffer against residual holiday volume while transitioning back to the lower baseline. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Christmas demand correction: Period 46 demand (84) shows stabilization after Christmas spike (107), suggesting a return toward the late-year baseline (~40).
