{
  "rationale": "We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 507909003 (Women's Blouse). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 86.2 units (79, 74, 103, 79, 96). The product is a staple women's blouse, and the date is mid-February. In many retail contexts, mid-February through March sees a steady or increasing demand for spring workwear/tailoring as customers update their wardrobes after winter. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available for sale in this same period. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1's demand plus a small buffer. I will forecast demand at approximately 90 units. Given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost, the cost of being stocked out is equal to the cost of carrying excess inventory, suggesting a target service level around 50-60%. I will order 90 units to meet the expected demand immediately.",

However, Period 1 (2019-02-11) saw a demand of 111, which is significantly higher than the previous 5-week average. This coincides with the mid-February period, often a time for 'new season' office wear updates or pre-spring shopping. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on Period 1's conclusion (ordered 90, arrived 90). The previous order of 90 was insufficient, resulting in 21 lost sales (demand 111 vs sold 90). For Period 2 (2019-02-18), I need to satisfy a higher demand level. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) parity, the risk of overstocking is equal to the cost of lost sales, but since demand seems to be trending upward or stabilizing at a higher level than Jan, I will target a forecast of approximately 110-120 units.

This sharp increase aligns with the pre-Spring retail season. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). In both Period 1 and Period 2, the stockouts (ending inventory 0) indicate lost sales; demand exceeded supply (111 > 90 and 159 > 115). I need to increase the order significantly to capture this rising demand and avoid further stockouts. Given the jump from 111 to 159 (+43%), I will forecast Period 3 demand at approximately 180-200 units.

To cover a forecast of ~140-150 units for Period 4, and considering the current 64 units on-hand, I need an order of ~86 units.
