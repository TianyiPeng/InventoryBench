February 11th is in the early pre-spring season when gym/fitness apparel demand typically begins to stabilize or increase as customers prepare for warmer weather. Historical Demand Analysis: The last 5 weeks show a declining trend from Jan 7 (270 units) to Feb 4 (137 units). The average of these 5 weeks is approx. 194 units, but the most recent figure is significantly lower. Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0. With L=0, an order placed now arrives and satisfies demand in the current period (Period 1). The total requirement for (L+1) periods is the forecast for Period 1. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. Strategy: I need to cover the demand for the week starting Feb 11. Given the downward trend but anticipating a potential floor or slight seasonal uptick for fitness gear, I will forecast around 150 units. Since current on-hand is 0, I must order the full forecast amount immediately to maximize profit and avoid stockouts.",

Demand has stabilized at a very low level over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), with values of 12, 18, 8, 9, and 6 (average: 10.6). The latest demand of 6 is the lowest yet. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is currently 10 units. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), but the very clear downward seasonal trend, I will target a stock level of 10-12 units for the immediate period. Since I have 10 units on hand and 0 in transit, and I expect demand to be between 5-10 units, a small order of 5 units will ensure availability while minimizing potential deadstock as we head further into autumn.",
