Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'DEXTER TANK' (Sports vest top). We have 5 historical demand samples: 270, 196, 180, 187, 137. There is a clear downward trend from the initial January peak. The mean of all samples is 194, but the most recent 3 samples (180, 187, 137) average 168. Given this is a sports vest top, demand might pick up as Spring approaches, but currently, it's trending down. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, the base stock formula should cover demand for Period 1. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the trend while maintaining some sample volume, as the downward trend is noticeable but we only have 5 total data points. L is set to 'default' (0). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use all 5 available samples to establish a baseline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the actual lead time was 0, matching the promised lead time. Demand for the most recent week was 84, which is significantly lower than the historical samples provided (Jan 7 to Feb 4: 270, 196, 180, 187, 137). This suggests a cooling trend from January highs. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent samples (137 from the end of history and 84 from Period 1, plus one prior) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the demand seems to be stabilizing at a lower level for this jersey vest top as we move into mid-February. L is set to default as the lead time of 0 was confirmed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 3 (2019-02-25), we are entering the pre-spring/spring season for activewear (DEXTER TANK). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (270, 196, 180, 187, 137) shows high initial volume then a tapering, while the game periods (P1: 84, P2: 121) show an upward trend. The item is a 'fast-drying jersey' sports top, which typically sees rising demand in late February/early March as consumers prepare for warmer weather and fitness routines. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), which I will continue to use. Given the recent increase from 84 to 121 in the game context and the seasonal relevance, I will use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, setting N=5 to encompass the most recent available behavior while capturing the momentum.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'DEXTER TANK', a sports vest top. Historically, demand was around 180-270 in January, but has been lower in February (avg ~104 over P1-P3). Current date is March 4, approaching the Northern Hemisphere spring/summer season where demand for sports tanks typically increases. Observations from P1-P3 show a stable lead time of 0 periods, confirmed by arrival data. On-hand inventory is 70, with no units in-transit. Given the seasonality potential and recent demand stabilization, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 periods (P1-P3) to capture the February baseline, while maintaining the L=0 parameter in line with observed performance.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'DEXTER TANK', a sports vest top. We are currently in mid-March, moving into spring. Historical demand (pre-game: 270, 196, 180, 187, 137) showing a general downward trend, but recent game data (84, 121, 108, 136) suggests demand is stabilizing or slightly increasing. In Period 4, demand (136) exceeded starting on-hand (121), resulting in zero ending inventory. The promised lead time is 0, and all game periods so far (P1-P4) have confirmed an actual lead time of 0. My goal is to set parameters that rebuild stock to meet this rising spring demand while accounting for the recent stockout. I'll use a recent 4-period window to capture current game demand dynamics (Avg: 112.25, Std: 21.8) and apply the explicit lead time of 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a sports vest top (DEXTER TANK). Historical demand samples from January (270, 196, 180, 187, 137) were high, followed by a lower stable period in Feb (P1: 84). Since P1, demand has been steadily increasing: 84 -> 121 -> 108 -> 136 -> 142. We have stocked out in P4 and P5, meaning true demand is likely higher than the 'sold' amount (136 and 142 respectively). As we move into late March, seasonal demand for sports/activewear usually increases. The confirmed actual lead time is 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this rising trend, but I will explicitly bump mu_hat to account for the stockouts and the likely continued spring uptrend. sigma_hat will be set using the recent window to account for increased volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: From post-holiday low in early Feb (84), demand is trending upward through March (now 140+ with stockouts), reflecting spring seasonality for activewear.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, and we are managing the 'DEXTER TANK', a sports vest top. Demand history shows a post-holiday low in early February (84) followed by a clear upward trend as spring arrives (121, 108, 136, 142, 128). Specifically, periods 4 and 5 experienced stockouts (demand > starting on-hand), indicating that recent demand is systematically higher than early samples. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the spring seasonality for activewear, I am focusing on the most recent 3 periods (Periods 4-6) to estimate demand, where demand averaged ~135 units. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and the associated volatility, while keeping L at its promised value of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 8 (April 1). The product (Dexter Tank) is a Ladies H&M Sport vest top, which is seeing a clear upward trend as spring progresses. Recent demand has been 142 (P5), 128 (P6), and 145 (P7), despite persistent stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods. The average demand over the last 3 periods is 138.3. Given the stockouts, realized demand is likely higher than sold units; the actual demand values recorded in the history (142, 128, 145) reflect this. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true. To prevent further stockouts during this growth phase, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime of approximately 140 units per week. This ensures the OR backend captures the elevated mean and volatility of the spring season.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a higher regime: Late March (Periods 5-7) show stable but high demand (avg 138 units), confirming the spring transition is complete and demand has nearly doubled from the February low (84).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'DEXTER TANK' for activewear, which is currently in its peak spring season (April). We are currently experiencing severe stockouts, having sold out the entire available inventory in 5 of the last 8 periods. Specifically, in Period 8, we sold 146 units but demand was 148, ending with 0 inventory. The mean demand over the last 4 periods (Periods 5-8) is roughly 141 units. To prevent further lost sales and lost profit ($4/unit), I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher stabilized demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 based on 'conclude' messages. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat as well to capture the current volatility of this spring demand peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $251.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand drop in Period 9 (80 units) appears to be an outlier compared to the established spring regime (approx. 140 units), possibly due to post-Easter lulls or timing of traffic. However, the product is a sports vest top, and April is prime time for activewear. Reconciling the history: lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. We currently have 69 units on hand and 0 in-transit. Given the recent history of frequent stockouts (Periods 4, 5, 7, 8), I will maintain a forecast close to the stable spring regime (approx. 138-142) rather than overreacting to the single low data point in Period 9. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (Periods 5-9) which yields a mean of 128.6, slightly lower than the peak but higher than the outlier, providing a conservative but responsive buffer. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture this recent variance.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is a sports vest top, likely influenced by fitness trends and seasonality. Historical data shows a spring transition where demand rose from ~84 units in early Feb to a plateau around 140 units in March/early April. However, the last two periods (P9 and P10) show a significant drop in demand (80 and 60 units respectively). This could signal a post-Easter/spring-break dip or the end of the initial spring workout peak. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time remains 0, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining enough safety stock (via sigma_hat) to avoid stockouts if demand bounces back. Period 11 (April 22) is post-Easter, supporting a cooling demand theory. I will use N=3 for demand parameters to weigh the most recent slow-down heavily.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Demand significantly dropped from a spring peak of ~140 to an average of 70 over the last two weeks, suggesting the spring seasonality peak has passed.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The DEXTER TANK is a ladies' sports vest top. Historically, demand peaked during the spring transition (March/early April) at ~140 units and has since dropped significantly. The last three periods (P9, P10, P11) show demand of 80, 60, and 71 respectively (average 70 units), confirming a post-peak plateau. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. Given the clear demand drop and stabilization at a lower level for three consecutive periods, I am setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to prioritize this lower demand regime and avoid excess holding costs. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for the current and lead period (1+0=1 period) based on this recent average.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is currently in a lower demand regime compared to its March peak. Observations from Period 9 to Period 12 (last 4 weeks) show demand values of 80, 60, 71, and 83, averaging approximately 73.5 units per week. This follows a significant drop from the spring peak (~140). The product is out of stock (ending on-hand inventory is 0). Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (12/12 successful same-period arrivals), I will maintain L at 'default'. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this post-peak regime (avg ~74). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the current volatility in this lower regime. This setting ensures the OR engine aims to cover the upcoming demand without overstocking as the spring peak has clearly concluded.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Demand for this 'DEXTER TANK' (sport vest) has shown high volatility. After a spring peak around 140 units (Periods 5-8), demand dropped to ~70 in April. However, the last two periods (12 and 13) show demand rising again (83 and 96), potentially signaling a pre-summer uptick. Currently, we are at zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, meaning we have missed demand in the last two periods. The actual lead time remains 0. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 samples (averaging approx. 78 units per period) but use an explicit mu_hat slightly higher than that average to catch the upward trend (around 90) and ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the current period's expected sales plus a safety buffer, given the stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery indicated: Mid-May (Periods 12-13) showing shift from ~70 units to ~90 units as summer approaches.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a sports tank top (DEXTER TANK). Period 15 is Late May (2019-05-20), entering the peak summer season for activewear. Historical demand shows a recent recovery from the mid-April lull: demand was 83 (P12), 96 (P13), and 92 (P14). This confirms a new 'Summer Recovery' regime averaging ~90 units as noted in Period 14 carry_over. Given the seasonal nature of the 'fast-drying jersey' sports vest, I expect demand to continue climbing or stabilize at this higher level (vs the April dip of ~70). Lead time is consistently 0 (all orders arrived same-period). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the last 3 weeks of the summer uptrend (Avg ~90). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for \u03c3\u0302 to reflect current volatility while ensuring the base stock calculation (for $4 profit vs $1 holding cost) maintains a high service level for this summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand recovery confirmed: Periods 12-14 show sustained increase to avg ~90 units (up from ~70 in April).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678692001 (Dexter Tank) is a summer-oriented activewear item. Current date is May 27, 2019. Recent demand over the last four periods (Periods 12-15) has averaged 86.5 units (83, 96, 92, 75). However, Periods 12 and 13 experienced stockouts, meaning actual latent demand was likely higher. The most recent demand (P15) was 75, showing some volatility. As we are entering June, demand for 'Loose-fitting sports vest tops' is expected to remain firm or increase with summer temperatures. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the summer recovery regime while accounting for the stockout-influenced figures. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture current volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The customer demand for the DEXTER TANK (Ladies H&M Sport) has entered a stable summer regime. Observations from Periods 12 through 16 show demand figures of 83, 96, 92, 75, and 83. This averages approximately 85.8 units per period, which is a consistent increase from the April lows of ~70. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (ordered and arrived in the same period). Given we are now in early June (2019/6/3), demand for activewear/tank tops is expected to remain firm or slightly increase as summer progresses. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific summer regime, which provides a balanced view of recent volatility and mean demand while filtering out the unrelated spring peak and April valley. Since lead time is stable at 0, I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize the zero-latency performance.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'DEXTER TANK', a sports vest top, which is entering peak summer seasonality (June 10). Demand has been trending upwards over the last few weeks: Period 13 (96), Period 14 (92), Period 15 (75), Period 16 (83), and Period 17 (109). The last period (P17) showed a significant jump to 109, resulting in a stockout. Given the spring peak reached ~140-150 units, I anticipate summer demand will likely sustain or exceed 100-110 units per week. The promised and observed actual lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average ~91) but adjust the method to explicit reflecting a forward-looking forecast of 115 to prevent stockouts during the summer ramp-up. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Entering summer peak with demand jumping to 109 units (up from avg ~85 in late May), consistent with seasonal activewear patterns.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is experiencing a summer demand regime. We recently moved from a mid-spring low (~70-80 units) to a summer peak. In Period 17, demand spiked to 109, and in Period 18, actual demand was 92. These fluctuations suggest a new regime mean around 100 units. Since 2019/06/17 is squarely in the summer season for activewear (fast-drying vest tops), I expect demand to remain elevated. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this summer regime while accounting for the recent variance, I will use a recent_N method with N=3 for demand (Periods 16-18) which captures the jump to 109 and the slight retreat to 92. This provides a mu_hat based on an average demand of approximately 95-100 units per period (multiplied by 1+L=1).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 (June 24th), which is the height of the summer season for activewear (DEXTER TANK). Recent demand has shown a clear upward trend: Period 17 (109), Period 18 (92), and Period 19 (128). The average demand over the last three periods (P17-P19) is approximately 110 units, compared to the previous regime of ~85. The stockout in Period 19 (ending on-hand: 0) confirms that current supply is trailing demand. Given the current date and the nature of the product, demand is expected to remain high or continue to climb throughout July. Lead time remains stable at 0. To capture the current summer peak and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the recent high-demand regime, and using a recent sigma_hat (N=3) to account for the increased volatility seen during these growth spikes.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime confirmed: demand has increased to an average of ~110 units (Periods 17-19) from late-May levels of ~85, driven by seasonal demand for sports tanks.

The DEXTER TANK is in its summer peak regime, moving into July. Recent demand data (Period 17-20) shows a fairly high average (~100 units), despite a lower outlier in Period 20 (71 units), potentially due to mid-season variance. The confirmed summer peak regime from the carry-over insights suggests maintaining a higher base stock to avoid stockouts, which occurred in Periods 17 and 19. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current summer demand levels and provide sufficient inventory for the July 1st period and beyond.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-07-08. We are in the mid-summer period for the DEXTER TANK. Demand in the most recent two periods (P20: 71, P21: 42) has dropped significantly from the early summer peak of ~110 units (P17-P19). This suggests the peak summer demand for this SKU has concluded as consumers pivot away from mid-summer purchases. Historical data from early February (post-holiday) showed demand as low as 84. Therefore, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent decline while balancing it against the earlier June peak, as N=2 would be too volatile. Analysis of history confirms a consistent lead time of 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and rapid response to demand shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Summer peak (avg ~110) has ended, with a sharp decline to 42 units. Recent 2-week average dropped to ~56 units, indicating the seasonal peak for this sports tank is over.

The seasonal peak for this sports tank (SKU 678692001) has clearly ended as we move into mid-July. Demand dropped from a summer high of ~110 units to 42 units in Period 21 and further down to 25 units in Period 22. This sharp decline signals a transition into a 'post-peak' regime. With 92 units currently on-hand and an expected demand significantly lower than previous months, we need to reduce inventory levels to avoid excessive holding costs. For Period 23, I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture this immediate downward shift in mu_hat while keeping lead time (L) as default (0), as all orders have consistently arrived within the same period. This will allow the OR backend to recalculate a lower base stock and likely result in a very small or zero order to utilize existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: Demand dropped sharply from ~110 units (Periods 17-20) to an average of 33.5 units over the last two weeks (Periods 21-22), indicating the end of the summer season for this SKU.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678692001 (a sports tank) has entered a post-peak seasonal decline as of late July. After a summer peak averaging ~110 units (Periods 17-20), demand plummeted to 42, 25, and 36 units in the last three periods (Avg \u2248 34.3). This confirms the 'post-peak' regime identified in Period 23. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With 56 units currently on hand and current demand levels around 35 units per week, the existing inventory is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the upcoming period without additional ordering. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand regime and prevent overstocking as the season ends.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Dexter Tank) has exited its summer peak regime (which averaged ~110 units/week) and entered a low-season regime. Demand over the last four periods (P21-P24) has been 42, 25, 36, and 29, yielding an average of 33 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 27 units, which nearly covers the expected demand for the upcoming period. To avoid excess holding costs for a seasonal item at the end of its peak, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods of the low-demand regime (N=4). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages. This approach minimizes the risk of overstocking during the off-season.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. The product is a loose-fitting sports vest top, which has clearly moved past its summer peak. History shows a major regime shift starting at Period 21 (early July), where demand dropped from ~110 units to a much lower level. Looking at the last 5 periods (Periods 21-25), demand has been 42, 25, 36, 29, and 21. This confirms a low-demand, post-peak regime with an average of approximately 30.6 units per period. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime, ensuring we do not overstock as we enter late summer/autumn. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, so I will continue using the default lead time setting.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-August (2019/8/12), well past its summer peak (which saw demand >100 units). Demand has significantly slowed down and is establishing a late-season trough. Over the last four periods (P23-P26), demand was 36, 29, 21, and 12, respectively. This averages ~24.5 units per period, but shows a clear continued downward trajectory as we move away from summer activities. The goal now is to prevent overstocking as the season ends to avoid unnecessary holding costs, while maintaining a lean safety stock. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand regime, ensuring the inventory pipeline reflects the current sales velocity of ~25 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak decline continues: Demand has dropped further from the late July average of 33.5 to a 4-week average (P23-P26) of 24.5 units, with the most recent period hitting a low of 12 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The DEXTER TANK is a 'Ladies H&M Sport' loose-fitting vest top, which has clearly followed a seasonal summer curve. Demand peaked in June/July (Period 17-20 avg ~100) and has been in a sustained decline since Period 21. The most recent demand samples are 36, 29, 21, 12, and 18. This matches late-summer retail patterns where activewear tanks are phased out for fall collections. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is 23.2 units with moderate variance. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this lower 'tail' of the season. The lead time remains consistently 0. These parameters will allow the OR engine to maintain a low but safe stock level to capture remaining late-season sales without accumulating excess holding costs for a declining product.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678692001 (sports vest top) is in a clear seasonal decline following its summer peak. Current date is late August 2019. Demand over the last four periods (P25-P28) has been 21, 12, 18, and 8 units respectively, averaging 14.75 units. This is a significant drop from the ~25 unit average seen in late July/early August. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Given the product type and the downward trend entering September, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to avoid over-ordering during this terminal phase of the summer season. On-hand inventory is 24 units, which is sufficient to cover about 1.5 periods of the current demand rate, meaning the OR backend will likely order a small replenishment or nothing to reach the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28: Demand has further declined to an average of ~15 units over the last 4 periods (P25-P28), down from the previous late-July regime of ~25 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is in a clear end-of-season decline phase as we enter September (P30). Historical demand has dropped significantly from the summer peak (~110 units) to a very low level. In the most recent four periods (P26-P29), demand was 12, 18, 8, and 9 units respectively (average 11.75). With On-hand inventory at 15 units, the current stock already covers the expected demand for more than one period. Given the holding cost is $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0, it is optimal to carry minimal stock to avoid erosion of profits. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this late-summer regime (avg ~12). Lead time remains stable at 0. No order is likely to be placed by the backend because on-hand >= mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Late-season demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging ~12 units over the last 4 periods (P26-P29), down from the August average of ~15.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

The DEXTER TANK is in its end-of-season phase as we enter September.

The average demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) is approximately 10.25 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, and on-hand inventory is currently 10, the system is well-positioned to meet the current low demand regime without excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this stabilized late-season demand of ~10 units, and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the low volatility of this regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the DEXTER TANK (sports vest) is in a significant late-season decline as we move into mid-September. Recent demand over the last four periods (P28-P31) has been 8, 9, 6, and 2 units, averaging approximately 6.25 units per period. This confirms the 'low level stabilization' noted in carry-over insights, but with a further downward drift. With 13 units currently on-hand and a promised lead time of 0, our inventory already covers roughly two periods of current demand levels. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this very low demand regime (approx 6 units/period) while maintaining L at default (0) as shipments have been consistently arriving on the same period they are ordered.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: Demand has further dropped from ~12 units to an average of ~6 units over the last 4 periods (P28-P31), reflecting the transition into autumn for this summer activewear SKU.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'DEXTER TANK', a summer activewear SKU. As of late September (Period 33), it is in a terminal late-season decline. A lead-time of 0 is consistently observed. Demand has dropped significantly: the last four periods (P29-P32) recorded demand of 9, 6, 2, and 2 units respectively. The most recent shift (detected in P32) indicates a drop to an average of ~6 units, but the last two periods suggest demand is even lower (avg 2). With 11 units on-hand and demand trending towards zero, the current stock covers at least 5 periods of forecasted demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this extremely low end-of-season demand (avg ~4.3 units per period). This will prevent unnecessary ordering as we approach the end of the product's seasonal cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: Demand has entered a terminal seasonal decline, averaging ~4 units over the last 4 periods (P29-P32), with the most recent two periods (P31-P32) consistently at 2 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Dexter Tank) is a summer activewear item currently in its terminal seasonal decline as we reach late September. Demand has dropped from a summer high of ~110 units to an average of ~3.5 units over the last 4 periods (P30-P33: 6, 2, 2, 5). With 6 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we already have approximately 1.5 to 2 weeks of stock at current demand levels. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the steady downward trend, I am setting the base stock parameters to reflect this low-demand regime using the most recent 4 periods to avoid overstocking during the off-season. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the DEXTER TANK is in its final seasonal decline as we move into October. Over the last 4 periods (P31-P34), demand hasn't exceeded 5 units, with an average of 3.0 units. Given that on-hand inventory is currently at 3 units and lead time remains 0, there is no immediate need to order additional stock. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect this terminal low-demand regime (current average = 3.0), and use a recent Window for sigma_hat to minimize holding costs while providing a tiny buffer for the remaining 3 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand stabilization at terminal lows verified. Last 4 periods (P31-P34) average 3.0 units, down from ~6 in mid-September.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a DEXTER TANK (sports vest), which exhibits strong seasonal behavior. Demand peaked in June/July (avg ~110) and has been in a terminal decline as we enter mid-October. The last 5 periods (P31-P35) have shown demand values of 2, 2, 5, 3, 0, averaging 2.4 units per week. The current stock of 5 units on-hand is sufficient to cover more than two weeks of this terminal-level demand. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the clear end-of-season trend, the goal is to minimize ending inventory to avoid unnecessary holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this low-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand has reached a terminal seasonal low, averaging 2.4 units over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), with the most recent period recording 0 demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the DEXTER TANK is in a stable terminal seasonal low as we enter late October. Over the last 6 periods (P31-P36), demand has been 2, 2, 5, 3, 0, and 6, resulting in an average of 3.0 units. The most recent spike to 6 units in P36 follows a period of 0 demand, suggesting minor volatility rather than a trend reversal. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a promised lead time of 0, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures enough stock to cover the current low demand while minimizing holding costs for a product clearly out of its primary summer season.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The DEXTER TANK is in its terminal seasonal phase (late October). Historical demand since Period 31 has been extremely low, averaging 2.4 units per week (2, 2, 5, 3, 0, 6, 1). The spike to 6 in Period 36 was followed by a return to 1 in Period 37, confirming the continued downward/terminal trend. We currently have 4 units on-hand, which covers the expected demand for the upcoming period given the current average. Transitioning to a recent_N strategy (N=7, covering Periods 31-37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this low-volume terminal regime (mean ~2.7, which at L=0 implies a base stock around the current inventory level). This minimizes holding costs relative to profit potential as we near the end of the year.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Dexter Tank' is a summer activewear item currently in its terminal off-season. Demand has been extremely low throughout October and early November, averaging 3.2 units over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) and 2.4 units over the last 10 periods (P29-P38). The most recent period (P38) saw a slight uptick to 6 units, but this is likely noise rather than a regime shift given the November 4th date. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this low-demand environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 5-period window to capture the current near-zero baseline. This will result in very small orders that only replenish the tiny amount of inventory consumed, preventing excess stock as the game concludes in 8 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product is a loose-fitting sports tank, which is a summer-seasonal item. Demand has remained in a terminal seasonal low for several weeks. Over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), demand has been: 0, 6, 1, 6, 2, averaging 3.0 units. Although there are small fluctuations, the overall trend is very low and stable. The lead time remains consistently 0. With an on-hand inventory of 4 units, we are already covered for approximately 1.3 weeks of average demand in this current regime. Given the low profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) and the low demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this late-season stability while avoiding over-stocking as the season ends. This will likely result in a very small or zero order.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (loose-fitting sports tank) is in a terminal low-demand phase following its summer peak. Current data (Periods 36-40) shows demand fluctuating between 1 and 6 units, with an average of 3.6 units over the last 5 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 3 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this late-season stability at low volumes. This prevents over-ordering for a seasonal product that is likely to see near-zero demand as winter approaches, while maintaining a small buffer for the occasional late-season sale.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand has stabilized at a terminal low level average of 3.6 units (Periods 36-40), following the summer/autumn decline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The DEXTER TANK is a ladies' sports vest, which is a highly seasonal summer product now in its terminal low-demand phase during late autumn/winter. Since Period 31, demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 2.7 units per week over the last 11 periods. The most recent demand (Period 41) was 2 units, following a sequence of 3, 2, 6, 1, 6 units. We have 4 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, we only need to cover the current period's demand (L=0, coverage = 1 period). I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this low-level baseline (avg 2.8), and sigma_hat using the same window to account for occasional small spikes (up to 6 units). This ensures we maintain minimal stock to meet the 1-6 unit fluctuations while avoiding excessive holding costs for a product that is effectively out of season.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

The SKU (Dexter Tank) is a summer sports vest top, and we are currently in early December (Period 43). Demand has stabilized at a terminal seasonal low, with an average of approximately 2.9 units over the last 7 periods (P36-P42). Specifically, recent demand values are 6, 1, 6, 2, 3, 2, 4. The promised lead time remains 0, and historical arrivals consistently confirm that actual lead time is 0. With on-hand inventory at 1 and demand averaging around 3 units, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 7 to capture this stabilized late-season behavior while maintaining a lean inventory to minimize holding costs for this off-season item.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019 (Period 44 out of 47). This sports tank SKU is in its terminal seasonal low. Demand over the last 8 periods (P36-P43) has averaged 3.1 units (2, 4, 3, 2, 6, 1, 6, 1 if we count backwards). The most recent period (P43) saw a demand of 1 unit. On-hand inventory is currently 5 units, with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, and we are within 4 periods of the game's end, the goal is to satisfy the remaining low demand while minimizing ending inventory. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 8 to capture the stable terminal demand (avg ~3.1) and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect the slight volatility in these low numbers (demand varies between 1 and 6).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678692001' (Dexter Tank) is a summer activewear item currently in its terminal low-demand season (December). Demand has been extremely low and stable for the past 10+ periods, averaging around 3 units per week. Recent demand for periods 41-44 was 2, 4, 1, and 3 respectively (average 2.5). There are currently 2 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the low holding cost ($1) and the low profit per unit ($4), combined with nearly immediate lead times (L=0 verified in recent history), we should maintain minimal stock to satisfy this low-level baseline demand without incurring unnecessary holding costs. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability in this terminal regime, and default for L since delivery remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the peak holiday season. The SKU is a sports tank top (Dexter Tank), which is highly seasonal (summer peak: Period 17-20). Demand transitioned to a terminal low in mid-September (Period 32 onwards). Since Period 41, demand has been extremely stable and low, averaging 1.8 units over the last 5 periods (P41-P45: 2, 4, 1, 3, 1). Although it is the holiday season, gym/activewear often sees a 'New Year, New Me' spike starting in January. However, for this specific period ending Dec 23, we remain in the winter trough. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stable low demand (average ~2.2 units) while maintaining a small buffer for the impending January uptick. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The SKU is a 'DEXTER TANK', a sports vest top, which has followed a clear seasonal arc from a spring/summer peak (~110 units) to a terminal low in autumn/winter. Demand has been extremely low and stable for several months. Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), demand has averaged approximately 2.4 units, with the most recent two periods at exactly 1 unit each. There are no impending seasonal triggers (like January fitness resolutions) expected to cause a significant spike in the very next period compared to this long-standing low regime. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable, low terminal-season demand while maintaining sufficient responsiveness to small fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 0.
