  "rationale": "Product 717464001 is a 'Nicky long' vest top, a basic apparel item. Historically (Jan-Feb 2019), demand started around 18-20 units but spiked significantly to 99, 72, and 68 units in the last three weeks of the history provided. This suggests a transition from a low-demand period (post-holiday/early winter) towards higher spring/summer base demand or specific seasonal preparation. Current Date: 2019-02-11. We are moving into mid-February, where spring apparel demand typically rises. Promised lead time is 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Since I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1 demand and establish safety stock for Period 2. Based on the recent 3-week average (~80 units), I will order 90 units to ensure high service level and account for potential momentum in the upward demand trend.",

Specifically, Period 1 (late Jan/early Feb) saw a massive spike to 133 units, which far exceeded my initial order of 90, resulting in a stockout (sold=90, lost 43 units of potential demand). Period 2 (Feb 18) aligns with the lead-up to spring/summer seasons for basic layering items. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods because the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1. Since lead time is 0, my order arrive in time for this period's demand resolution. Based on the recent peak of 133 and the upward trend from Jan (20 -> 99), I will forecast a high demand of approximately 130-140 units.

I am starting from scratch and experiencing stockouts. e) Final Order Logic: Demand is trending up sharply (133 -> 185).

As we are now in early September (2019/09/09), demand is showing characteristics of a post-summer transition. After a late-August cooling trend (P28: 107), demand has stabilized slightly higher (P29: 126, P30: 112). Historical January demand was quite low (~20-70), suggesting a significant decline occurs as autumn/winter approaches. However, current demand remains around the 110-120 range. The lead time is confirmed as 0. Inventory is very low (2 units), necessitating a full replenishment for this period's demand. I will forecast demand at approximately 115 units, aiming to cover the expected demand while maintaining a small buffer, as holding costs ($1) are relatively low compared to stockout costs ($19). Since the lead time is 0, the order will arrive in time for this period's sales.",

  "rationale": "The product is a Jersey Basic Vest Top. We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the peak holiday week. Historically, January demand for this SKU was low (avg ~50), and we are seeing a consistent return to this winter baseline. Recent demand (P43-P45) has been remarkably stable at 47, 57, and 54 units (avg 53). Lead time is confirmed as 0. Given the current on-hand inventory of 6 units and the holiday schedule, I expect demand to remain in the 50-60 range for the next two periods. To satisfy Period 46 demand (est. 60) and maintain a small safety buffer for Period 47 (est. 55), I need a total of approximately 115 units. With 6 units on hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 109 units to ensure no stockouts during the Christmas/New Year transition.",

  "rationale": "The product is a Jersey Basic vest top, which typically exhibits seasonality with a peak in summer and mid-season promotional fluctuations. We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30), entering the post-holiday/New Year period. Historically (Jan 2019 data), demand in early January was very low (18-20 units), while late January saw a significant spike to ~70-100 units. Recent December data (P43-P46) shows demand has cooled from the November peak, moving from 47 to 23 units. Given the transition into early January, a baseline of ~20-30 units is expected. Inventory currently stands at 92 units on-hand, which is sufficient to cover approximately 3-4 weeks of early January demand (predicted 20-30 per week). The actual lead time is 0. Since the current inventory already exceeds the likely demand for the first week of 2020, even considering a potential early-year safety stock for mid-month increases, ordering 0 units is the most profitable decision to minimize holding costs while the on-hand stock is steadily depleted toward historical baseline levels.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand regime shift at Period 46: Year-end demand has bottomed out at 23 units, aligning with late-December seasonality and historical Jan start levels (~18-20).",
