Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for this 'Nicky long' vest top shows a significant spike in mid-to-late January (99 and 72 units) compared to earlier weeks (18-20 units), followed by a slight stabilization at 68 units. Given this is a 'Divided Basics' item, we may be seeing the start of a spring ramp-up or a specific promotional effect. The promised lead time is 0. With on-hand inventory at 0, we need to establish a base stock that covers the immediate period. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=3) to focus on the higher demand levels observed recently (avg ~79.6), rather than the lower values from early January. This will ensure we have enough stock to meet the new established baseline while the OR backend manages the safety stock via sigma_hat.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 133 units, which is significantly higher than the average of the initial 5 samples (avg: 55.4). The SKU is a 'Nicky long' vest top, a basic garment that often sees increased demand as we move towards spring (mid-February). The actual lead time for Period 1 was 0, matching the promised lead time. However, Period 1 ended with a stockout (sold 108, demand 133), meaning we missed 25 units of potential sales. I will use 'recent_N' for demand forecasting to capture the recent spike (choosing N=3 to weigh the recent trend and the prior 2 samples) and 'calculate' for lead time since 0 was confirmed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Nicky long' jersey vest top. We are currently in late February. Historical demand in January was relatively low (mean ~30 excluding the spike on 1/21). However, Period 1 and Period 2 (Feb 11 & Feb 18) show a massive surge in demand (133 and 185 units respectively), and we have completely stocked out twice with zero ending inventory. This indicates a strong upward shift or seasonal trend as spring approaches. The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time has consistently been 0. To capture this rapid growth and avoid further stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=2) for both demand mean and volatility to prioritize the high Feb volumes over the lower Jan samples. This will increase the base stock level significantly to match the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 11 (Period 1): Average weekly demand surged from ~50 to 159 (+218%), resulting in consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2640.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Nicky long' jersey vest top. We are in early March (Period 4). Historically, demand was low (~55 avg), but shifted dramatically starting in mid-February (Period 1). Over the last three periods (P1-P3), demand has been 133, 185, and 143, averaging 153.6 units/week. This shift likely reflects a seasonal uptick in 'Divided Basics' as spring approaches. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. In Period 3, the inventory finally met demand with an ending on-hand of 77. Given the current average demand of ~154 and a lead time of 0, the target base stock (calculated as mu_hat = (1+L)*mean) should reflect the new regime. Using recent_N (N=3) captures the current mean (153.6) and volatility better than the long-term history, ensuring we maintain high service levels for this high-margin (Profit:Holding = 19:1) basic item.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3220.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Nicky long' vest top, a basic garment likely entering higher demand as spring approaches in the northern hemisphere (March). Historical demand before Period 1 averaged ~55 units, but starting from Period 1, we entered a new regime with an average demand of 158 units (P1: 133, P2: 185, P3: 143, P4: 171). We have consistently stocked out or come close to it. The observed lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current inventory is low at 29 units with nothing in-transit. To prevent lost sales during this sustained high-demand phase, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average, and sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the increased volatility in this new period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Nicky long' jersey vest top (Divided Basics), which is a spring/summer category. Current date is March 18, 2019. Historically (from given samples), demand was low in January (avg ~25 excl. outlier) but shifted significantly upwards starting February 11. Over the last 5 periods (P1-P5), demand has averaged 152.8 units (133, 185, 143, 171, 132). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Following the 'recent_N' strategy, I will set N=5 to capture this sustained high-demand regime while moving past the low-demand January data. This will set mu_hat based on the (1+L) * mean of the last 5 periods, which is approximately 1 * 153 = 153, and sigma_hat based on the volatility of these sessions to maintain appropriate safety stock for this seasonal basic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1667.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Nicky long' vest top, a basic garment whose demand shifted significantly in mid-February, consistent with a pre-Spring seasonal build-up. Since Period 1, the weekly demand has averaged approximately 142.8 units (Sample: 133, 185, 143, 171, 132, 93). While the most recent period (93) shows a slight dip, the overall regime remains much higher than the initial January data. The confirmed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), which allows for responsive ordering. To stabilize inventory and capture the current seasonal demand level without overreacting to the single low Period 6 sample, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire new regime since Feb 11. With a high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level, which is appropriate for a basic item with persistent demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1263.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Nicky long' vest top, which typically sees higher demand during the spring/summer season (February-March-April timeframe). Reviewing the history from Period 1 to Period 7 (Feb 11 to Mar 25), demand peaked early (Periods 1-5, mean ~153) and has steadily declined in the last two periods (Period 6: 93, Period 7: 73). Current on-hand inventory is 124 units. Since the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, we should focus on the transition from the high-demand early spring period to a more moderate mid-spring level. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 captures the lower demand values of 132, 93, and 73 (mean ~99), preventing excessive overstocking as the initial surge subsides. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to maintain a buffer for potential volatility while reflecting the stabilized trend. Lead time L is kept at default as 0-period arrivals are confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak for 'Nicky long' vest top observed early Feb to mid-March (avg ~153), followed by a downward trend starting Period 6 (Mar 18), with demand dropping below 100.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Nicky long' vest top, which experienced high early-season demand from mid-February (Period 1) through mid-March (Period 5), averaging approximately 153 units per week. Since Period 6 (March 18), demand has entered a lower regime, with the last three weeks averaging 80 units (93, 73, 74). This indicates the post-peak phase of the early spring season. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory while maintaining a high service level (optimal q = 0.95), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new lower demand regime. This will allow the OR engine to right-size base stock levels accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 6 (Mar 18): average weekly demand decreased from ~153 to ~80 (-48%) following the initial spring peak.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Nicky long' vest top (basic jersey), which experienced a demand peak from early February through mid-March (avg ~153) and subsequently entered a lower demand regime around March 18 (avg ~80). However, Period 9 (April 8) showed a significant and unexpected demand spike to 133, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is now 0). This spike may be related to pre-Easter shopping or warming weather. While the sustained lower regime was the working assumption, this latest data point suggests increased volatility or a secondary spring peak. To prevent further stockouts while inventory is depleted, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the shift from the low-demand plateau (73, 74) to the recent high (133), providing a more responsive mu_hat than the full history or the very low recent observations. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 9 (April 8) with a spike to 133, diverging from the previously established low-demand regime (~80).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717464001 (Nicky long vest top) is currently in Period 11 (late April). Historical data shows a clear peak from Feb to mid-March (avg ~153) followed by a cooling-off period starting Period 6 (avg ~80). However, a secondary surge appeared in Period 9 (133 units) and Period 10 (100 units), likely driven by warmer weather or spring sales events. Lead time is consistently 0. Current on-hand inventory is 40. Given the recent rebound in demand (averaging ~116 over the last 2 weeks), I will use recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized post-peak behavior while acknowledging the recent uptick. This N=5 covers Period 6 to 10, smoothing out the transition from the low point (~74) to the recent spikes (~133, ~100).

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand surge detected in late April (Period 9-10): demand rebounded to 116.5 avg from the previous low regime of ~80.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717464001' (Nicky long vest top) is experiencing high demand volatility as we enter late April/May. After an initial peak in February/March (avg ~153) and a drop in late March (avg ~80), recent weeks have shown significant swings: 133 (P9), 100 (P10), and a sudden drop to 56 (P11). The current date is April 29, 2019. Historically, jersey basics can see erratic demand during the late spring transition. In Period 11, the system over-ordered relative to the realized demand of 56, resulting in 79 units on-hand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To manage this volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current regime which averages ~96 units ( (133+100+56)/3 ). This provides a more responsive forecast than the long-term average while smoothing out the most recent outlier low. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the increased instability seen over the last month and a half.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in April (Periods 9-11), with weekly demand ranging from 56 to 133, deviating from the previously 'stabilized' low-demand regime of ~80.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (May 6), the product 'Nicky long' vest top is entering the late spring/early summer season. Historical demand since the drop in late March (Period 6) has been volatile, with a secondary surge in April (Periods 9-10) before softening again in Period 11 (56 units) and Period 12 (89 units). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 94.5 units, which reflects a higher average and higher volatility compared to the initial post-peak 'stabilized' regime of ~80. Given that the promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true (actual lead time 0), I will continue to use the 'calculate' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current volatile demand pattern (April-early May) while allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the high target service level (95%) driven by the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late April/early May (Periods 9-12) at an average of ~95 units, significantly higher and more volatile than the mid-March to early-April baseline of ~80.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717464001' (Nicky long vest top) has shown demand stabilization following a volatile April. Demand in the most recent five periods (Periods 9-13) has been 133, 100, 56, 89, and 75, averaging 90.6 units per week. This aligns with the 'Carry-over Insight' that a new regime of approximately ~95 units has formed since late April. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the current stabilization while acknowledging the recent volatility (standard deviation of ~28 in this regime), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5. This window captures the full 'secondary surge' and subsequent stabilization, providing the OR engine with a relevant mean (around 90) and variance to set a base stock that covers anticipated demand while managing holding costs for this basic jersey item.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic vest top, showing steady demand with some fluctuations as we enter the summer season. Looking at the history, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since Period 9 (April 8), we've seen a secondary demand regime stabilization. Demand for the last 6 periods (P9 to P14) has been: 133, 100, 56, 89, 75, 100. The mean of this recent regime is approximately 92.2 units, which is higher than the previous trough but lower than the early spring peak. Given the current date is May 20th and we are approaching summer, demand for basic jersey tops is expected to remain stable or slightly increase. I will use a N=6 historical window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilized volatility and level accurately, as the global average is skewed by the very high initial peak in February.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a 'Nicky long' vest top, a basic jersey item. Demand has settled into a stable but somewhat volatile regime since late April (Period 9). Looking at the last 7 periods (Periods 9-15), demand values are 133, 100, 56, 89, 75, 100, 84, resulting in a mean of approximately 91 units. The most recent demand (Period 15) was 84 units. Given this stability, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and the observed volatility (which ranges from 56 to 133). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history, so I am maintaining the default lead time setting.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for May 2019 (Periods 13-15) shows a stable average of ~86 units, aligning with the broader late-spring stabilization observed since April.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717464001' (Nicky long vest top) is currently in a stabilized demand regime representing late spring and early summer. Period 16 demand was 103 units, which is slightly higher than the May average of ~86 units but within the established range of the current regime. Over the last 4 periods (Periods 13-16, spanning May), the average demand is 90.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met. To set the base stock level, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent stabilized demand and volatility profile (May 2019). This approach balances against the slight uptick seen in the last period while maintaining high service levels (q = 19/20 = 95%) without accumulating excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for May 2019 (Periods 13-16) stabilized at an average of 90.5 units/week, marking the transition from spring peak into early summer baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2147.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/06/03), demand for the 'Nicky long' vest top surged to 198 units, significantly exceeding the recent 'early summer baseline' of ~90.5 established in Periods 13-16. This spike occurred as we enter June, suggesting a summer heat/seasonal demand jump for basic vest tops. Because we sold out (sold 113, demand 198, ending on-hand 0), the true demand is at least 198. Forecast for Period 18 needs to proactively account for this increased summer volume. I will shift the \u03bc\u0302 estimate to reflect this higher demand level using the last 5 samples (averaging 112, but heavily weighted by the recent 198). Given the stockout and the product description (Jersey Basic vest top), I will set \u03bc\u0302 using recent_N=5 to capture this upward movement while maintaining responsiveness to volatility (sigma_hat recent_N=5). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected at Period 17 (June 3): demand increased to 198 units from a previous 4-week average of ~90 units (+120%), suggesting the start of a peak summer demand regime for vest tops.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717464001 (vest top) is currently experiencing a summer demand surge. While Period 17 saw a massive spike to 198 units, Period 18 settled at 102 units. The 2-period average for June is 150 units, significantly higher than the May average of ~90. The stockout in Period 17 was recovered by a large order in Period 18, and we currently have 92 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture the current summer peak while accounting for the high volatility (198 vs 102), I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods to baseline at 150 ((1+L) * 150) and using a larger N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility spike. This targets a high service level appropriate for a high profit ($19)/low holding cost ($1) item during its peak season.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed: June average demand (Periods 17-18) is 150 units, a 66% increase over the May baseline of 90 units, characterized by high volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are in the middle of a summer demand regime for the 'Nicky long' vest top. Historically, this season exhibits high volatility. Demand in the last three weeks has been 198, 102, and 107. While the immediate last two weeks show a stabilization around 105, the spike to 198 in Period 17 and the summer context suggest we should prepare for a potential mean demand higher than the spring baseline. The observed lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To balance the high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. I am using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current summer demand levels (avg ~135.6) while acknowledging the high volatility seen in the 198-102-107 sequence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $955.00

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historically, demand for this 'Nicky long' vest top saw a significant peak in June (averaging ~150 in the first half of the month), but the most recent two periods (Periods 19-20) show a marked decline (107 and 59 units respectively). The average for the month of June (Periods 17-20) is approximately 116 units. However, the drop to 59 units in Period 20 suggests the mid-summer peak might be cooling off or displaying high volatility. We are currently holding a high on-hand inventory of 166 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, and the last 4 periods average 116.5 units with a downward trend, I am setting mu_hat to be more responsive to the recent June surge while acknowledging the latest drop. Using N=4 for mu_hat (covering all of June) results in an estimate of 116.5, which, given the 166 units on-hand, will likely result in a very small or zero order this period to bleed off excess inventory and minimize holding costs ($1/unit). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand peak (June 2019) averaged 116.5 units, but showed high volatility and a significant drop to 59 units by the end of June (Period 20).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Nicky long' vest top, which typically sees peak demand in summer. Historical demand analysis shows a high-demand period in June (Periods 17-21) with an average of approximately 118 units/week, though volatility remains high (standard deviation approx 50). The most recent demand was 124 units (Period 21), rebounding from a low of 59 in Period 20. As we are currently in July (Period 22), we expect this mid-summer demand regime to continue. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current summer volatility and average demand Level. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so I will stick with the 'default' lead time method.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (Periods 17-21) stabilized at an average of ~118 units with significant weekly volatility (range 59-198), consistent with seasonal expectations for vest tops in July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717464001 (vest top) is currently in a mid-summer demand regime. Since Period 17 (early June), demand has shown high volatility (range 59-198) with an average of approximately 114 units per week. The most recent demand (Period 22) was 90 units, following a 124 in Period 21. There is no evidence of a systematic downward trend yet, as July is typically a peak month for this category. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I will use the recent 6-period window (Periods 17-22) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current summer demand regime and its associated volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the expected seasonal demand while accounting for the significant weekly fluctuations observed recently.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717464001 (Nicky long vest top) is currently in its summer demand cycle. Since early June (Period 17), the demand has averaged approximately 115 units per week, although it remains highly volatile (ranging from 59 to 198 units). The most recent three periods (P21-P23) show demand levels of 124, 90, and 122, resulting in a three-week average of 112 units. This suggests the high-demand summer regime is still active as of late July. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing volatility, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 (covering the summer period from P17 to P23) to capture the current seasonal mean and standard deviation. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current summer peak while respecting the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (Periods 17-23) sustained an average of ~115 units per week with continued high volatility, confirming a prolonged summer peak for vest tops through July.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717464001 (Nicky long vest top) is currently in a mid-summer demand regime. Analysis of history from Period 17 to Period 24 (eight weeks) shows an average demand of approximately 110 units (specifically 108.5 during the last 8 weeks). Although there is significant weekly volatility (ranging from 59 to 198), the regime has stabilized at this higher summer level compared to the spring baseline. The most recent demand (Period 24) was 75, preceded by 122 and 90. Given the high profitability ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. I will use a recent_N of 8 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this summer regime's mean and its characteristic volatility. Lead time (L) remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful same-period arrivals.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, which is later summer. Historically, for this SKU ('Nicky long' vest top), we've seen a prolonged summer peak from Period 17 (June 3rd) through July, with demand averaging approximately 112 units per week (Period 17-25: 198, 102, 107, 59, 124, 90, 122, 75, 135). The most recent demand was 135 units, showing that the summer peak is still active but highly volatile. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. To handle the high volatility (standard deviation is roughly 36 units over the last 9 periods) and the relatively high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will use a recent_N window of 9 (the length of the summer regime) to capture the current mean and variance accurately for the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak for vest tops sustained through July (Periods 17-25) with an average demand of ~112 units and high volatility (range 59-198).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717464001' (Nicky long vest top) is currently in a sustained summer demand peak. Demand in the last two periods (Period 25 and 26) has increased to 135 and 146 units respectively, which is higher than the early July average (~112). As we are in mid-August (2019-08-12), high demand for vest tops is expected to continue before a late-season taper. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 26 conclude' message. To capture the recent upward trend within the broader summer regime, I will use a 'recent_N' window of 10 periods (covering mid-June to early August) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the high seasonal volatility with the recent demand strength, ensuring enough inventory (on-hand is currently low at 33) to meet potential spikes while accounting for the high reward-to-cost ratio ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: August demand surge detected (Periods 25-26): Demand increased to an average of 140.5 units, exceeding the previous summer baseline of 112 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The 'Nicky long' vest top is in its late-summer demand peak. Since Period 25 (July 29), we have seen a significant and sustained increase in demand: 135 units, 146 units, and 143 units. This averages 141.3 units over the last 3 weeks, compared to the previous summer baseline of ~112 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this most recent August demand surge (Periods 25-27), ensuring the OR backend orders enough to meet this higher demand level while balancing against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: August demand regime confirmed (Periods 25-27): Average demand increased to 141.3 units, a 26% increase over the previous summer baseline of ~112 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The 'August demand regime' (detected at Period 28) shows a significant increase in average demand to approximately 141.3 units, compared to the July baseline of ~112 units. Recent demand samples are: P25=135, P26=146, P27=143, and P28=107. Although P28 saw a slight dip to 107, the overall four-week average (P25-P28) is 132.75. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods based on all history. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the sustained high demand observed throughout August, and use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility in this peak period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Historical demand for this vest top shows a distinct August peak (Periods 25-29) averaging ~131 units, which is higher than the early summer baseline of ~112. However, with the transition into September, a seasonal tapering is expected for summer-specific items like vest tops. The last few periods (P28-P29) show demand softening slightly (107 and 126 units) compared to the mid-August peaks of ~145. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To balance the risk of a late-summer stockout against potential overstocking as autumn approaches, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This captures the high-demand August regime while allowing for the slight downward trend seen in the most recent two weeks to start influencing the order quantity. The target inventory will be based on the average of the last 5 weeks (~131 units) plus a buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: September transition: Expected seasonal tapering of August demand peak (avg ~131) for vest tops as autumn begins.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are transitioning out of the August peak (avg ~131 units) for the 'Nicky long' vest top into the autumn season. Demand in Period 30 was 112 units, which is lower than the August average but still relatively high. Historically, this SKU has shown significant regime shifts tied to seasonal transitions. Given the expected seasonal tapering for a 'Vest top' as autumn approaches, I will use a shorter window (N=4) to capture the cooling demand more responsively. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods based on all history. Setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances the recent slightly higher volatility with the downward trend observed since the end of August.

Carry-over insight: September demand tapering confirmed: Demand has dropped from August average of ~141 to ~119 in the last two weeks (Periods 29-30), signaling the end of the peak summer regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are entering mid-September, a transition period for 'Vest tops' (717464001) as autumn approaches. While Period 31 saw a demand spike to 147 units, the previous two weeks (Periods 29-30) showed a tapering trend (avg 119) compared to the August peak (avg 141). Historically, vest tops are summer-seasonal, and we anticipate demand will continue to soften as the weather cools. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Inventory is extremely low at 2 units on-hand. I will set mu_hat using a recent 4-week window (N=4, Periods 28-31) to capture the start of this transition while remaining responsive to the recent spike, balancing the anticipated seasonal decline against the risk of stockouts during high-volatility weeks.

Carry-over insight: September demand remains volatile: Period 31 saw an unexpected spike to 147 units despite the general downward trend from the August peak (avg 141).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Nicky long' vest top, which typically sees peak demand during late spring and summer. We are now in late September (Period 33), and demand historicals show a tapering from the August peak (avg ~141) toward a lower autumn baseline. While Period 31 had a spike (147), Period 32 demand dropped to 81, supporting the 'September tapering' insight with higher volatility. Lead time consistent at 0. Given the move into autumn, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-week window (N=4) to capture the trend decrease (averaging ~116.5) while maintaining sigma_hat on a wider window (N=7) to account for the high volatility observed during transition periods. This ensures we don't overstock as seasonal demand cools while staying protected against lingering clusters of warm-weather shopping.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift confirmed: demand has transitioned from an August average of ~141 to a more volatile September average of ~114 (Periods 29-32) as autumn begins.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand spike occurred in Period 33 (September 23), where demand reached 282 units, far exceeding the previous September average of ~114 and the August peak of ~141. This resulted in a complete stockout (0 units on-hand). The current date is September 30, which may coincide with a late-season clearance or a specific promotional event for basic vest tops. Given the sudden increase (nearly 2.5x the previous 4-week average), I must adjust mu_hat to ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this new, high-volatility regime while on-hand inventory is depleted. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the volatility of September (81 to 282) while still including the recent surge. Lead time remains stable at 0 based on history.

Carry-over insight: Major demand surge at Period 33: demand spiked to 282 units from a September average of ~114 (+147%), leading to a stockout. This indicates a potential clearance event or promotional period for basic jersey tops.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. Period 33 (Sept 23) experienced a massive demand spike of 282 units (likely a clearance or end-of-season promotion), followed by Period 34 returning to a more typical late-season level of 116 units. The product is a vest top, which in October (autumn) typically sees a sustained downward trend in demand. The carry-over insights correctly identified the Sept 23 surge as an anomaly. Given the transition into autumn, I expect demand to continue tapering from the summer/September baseline. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent volatility including the spike and the subsequent normalization, but I will monitor for a sustained drop in demand as we move deeper into Q4. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand volatility: Sept 23 spike (282 units) followed by normalization (116 units) indicates the conclusion of the summer vest top cycle; transition to autumn baseline expected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1462.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717464001 (vest top) is entering mid-October, transitioning from its primary summer and early autumn peak into a likely lower-demand late-autumn regime. Recent history shows high volatility: a massive spike to 282 in P33 (likely a clearance or promotion), followed by normalization to 116 (P34) and 87 (P35). The 'conclude' messages show the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently healthy at 191 units on-hand. Given the product type and date (Oct 14), I expect demand to settle around or below the recent non-spike levels. I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the post-spike normalization period (P33-P35 avg = 161.6, heavily skewed by the 282 spike; the last two periods avg is 101.5). Setting N=5 for mu_hat better captures the transition trend while dampening the outliers. L is kept at 'calculate' as lead time is stable at 0. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the recent volatility in the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Post-clearing normalization: Following the Period 33 surge (282 units), demand has stabilized at an average of 101.5 units over the last two weeks (Periods 34-35), marking the transition to late-autumn baseline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product is a 'Nicky long' vest top, a basic jersey item. Demand over the last three weeks (Periods 34-36) since the late September clearing event (P33) has averaged 111.3 units (116, 87, 131). This is significantly higher than the expected 'autumn baseline' of ~80-90 units hypothesized in previous periods, suggesting sustained demand for this specific basic SKU or a later-than-expected seasonal tail. Given high volatility (std dev ~22 over the last 3 weeks) and the relatively high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), I am setting mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this higher-than-expected stabilization level, while using the last 5 periods for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility including the P33 surge and subsequent normalization. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-clearing demand regime (Periods 34-36) stabilized at an average of 111.3 units/week, higher than the pre-surge September average of ~114 units, indicating sustained late-autumn resilience for this basic SKU.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717464001' (a basic jersey vest top) is experiencing high late-autumn demand volatility. Period 37 saw a significant demand spike to 219 units, following a stabilized post-clearing average of ~111 units. This spike suggests either a late-season promotion or a shift in baseline demand for this basic SKU. Given the stock on hand is currently very low (28 units) and the promised lead time is 0, it is critical to order sufficiently to meet this elevated demand. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (34-37) to capture the recent mean of 138.25 units, which balances the mid-October spike with the earlier October baseline. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 4 periods to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation ~58.6). This ensures the OR engine maintains a safety stock appropriate for the current unpredictable environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in Period 37: demand spiked to 219 units from a 3-week average of 111 units (+97%), indicating that late-autumn demand for this basic SKU is less stable than previously estimated.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717464001 (vest top) is experiencing a significant late-autumn demand surge. Demand in Period 37 was 219 and Period 38 was 225, far exceeding the previously established post-clearing stabilization average of ~111 units. This represents a sustained 2-period shift that suggests a new high-demand regime, possibly due to a late-season promotion or the SKU's 'Basics' nature and 'Longer' fit being relevant for winter layering. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0. Given the high volatility and the recent doubling of demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this surge (Avg 191.7, Std 51.5) while allowing for some regression to the mean. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts during this high-velocity period.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-autumn demand surge detected (Periods 37-38): demand increased to an average of 222 units from a previous 3-week average of 111 units (+100%).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717464001 (vest top) is experiencing a secondary demand surge in late autumn (November), with demand peaking at 219 and 225 units in Periods 37-38 before dropping to 89 units in Period 39. This follows a previous pattern of high volatility. The 3-week average for this new regime (Periods 37-39) is approximately 177 units, which is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~111 units. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the priority is protecting against stockouts during these volatile spikes. I will use the recent 3 periods to capture this high-mean/high-variance regime, ensuring the base stock level targets the elevated average while accounting for the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand surge confirmed (Periods 37-39): average demand increased to 177.7 units with high volatility (range 89-225), significantly exceeding the previous baseline of ~111 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717464001' (a basic fitted jersey vest top) is currently in a high-volatility late-autumn demand phase. While Periods 37-38 saw a significant demand surge (avg >220 units), the last two weeks (Periods 39-40) have seen a sharp drop to 89 and 77 units respectively. This pattern suggests the late-autumn surge has peaked, potentially due to a specific promotional event or early winter transition. I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to capture this immediate downward trend (averaging ~153 units) while respecting the high variance observed in this regime. This helps the OR backend adjust the base stock downward to avoid excessive holding costs as demand cools, while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand surge peaked in Period 38 and has significantly tapered in Periods 39-40 (avg demand dropped from ~222 to 83, a -62% change), signaling a transition toward a lower year-end baseline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717464001 (Nicky long vest top) has entered a post-peak late-autumn regime. After a significant demand surge in late October/early November (Periods 37-38: avg ~222 units), demand has sharply declined over the last three periods (Periods 39-41) to an average of 75.7 units (89, 77, 61). This confirms the 'tapering' identified in the previous period's carry-over and signals a transition toward a lower year-end baseline as seasonal demand for vest tops naturally wanes in late November. The on-hand inventory is currently high (224 units) relative to this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the remaining periods, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this recent downward trend (Periods 39-41), rather than being skewed by the prior surge.

Carry-over insight: Year-end demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand for Periods 39-41 dropped to 75.7 units (a 66% decrease from the late-autumn surge of ~222), establishing a low-demand baseline for the winter season.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand unexpectedly spiked to 204 units, contradicting the year-end deceleration trend (avg ~75) observed in Periods 39-41. This SKU (a basic jersey vest top) is prone to high volatility and late-season surges, as seen previously in Periods 33 and 38. With on-hand inventory now depleted to 20 units and a 0-period lead time, the OR backend needs to react immediately to this volatility. I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (Periods 37-42) to capture both the recent low baseline and the high-demand spikes (avg ~142.5), which provides a more robust forecast than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (6) to account for the heightened volatility (range 61-225). This ensures the base stock is high enough to satisfy potential high demand while protecting against the cost of holding excess stock if demand reverts to the winter baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged at Period 42 (Dec 2): Demand unexpectedly rebounded to 204 units after a 3-week low-demand baseline of ~76 units, suggesting continuing late-season instability for this basic SKU.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), nearing the end of the year. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The demand for this vest top SKU has become highly unstable with significant late-season surges followed by sharp drops. Specifically, Period 42 saw a spike to 204 units, while Period 43 dropped to 47 units. Given this extreme volatility and the 'Dec 2nd' rebound observed in the carry-over, a simple mean is insufficient. To capture the recent behavior while smoothing out the extreme 47-unit drop, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the last 5 weeks: 89, 77, 61, 204, 47) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the recent average (~96/week) and the high standard deviation required to cover potential late-December spikes without over-stocking during the year-end wind-down. On-hand inventory is healthy at 227 units, which is over 2x the recent average, so the OR backend will naturally limit new orders unless the parameters suggest a significantly higher required base stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: High year-end volatility confirmed (Periods 39-43); weekly demand fluctuating between 47 and 204 units, making the winter baseline unstable compared to previous years.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for SKU 717464001 has been extremely volatile, oscillating between 47 and 204 units over the last five weeks (Periods 40-44). Specifically, demand values were 77, 61, 204, 47, and 57. The average of these last five periods is approximately 89.2 units. Given this high variance at the end of the year, I am using a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and the significant volatility. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), so L remains at 'default'. The objective is to maintain enough stock to cover the potential 200+ unit spikes seen recently while avoiding excessive holding costs during the 50-unit 'lull' weeks.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 23, 2019 (Period 46). We are in the final stages of the winter season for this SKU (Jersey Basic Vest Top). Inventory is currently healthy at 143 units on-hand. Lead time is consistently 0. Recent demand (Periods 43-45) has stabilized after significant year-end volatility, with demand of 47, 57, and 54 units (average ~53). This represents a clear shift from the previous volatile period (up to 204 units) to a much lower, more stable winter baseline. For Period 46, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new, lower demand regime (Periods 42-45: 204, 47, 57, 54). Although Period 42 was an outlier (204), including it ensures the OR backend maintains a safe buffer against the high year-end volatility observed in carry-over insights, while allowing the mean to drift downward toward the current 50-60 unit trend. L is set to default as the actual lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime stabilized at Period 43 (Dec 2): Demand has dropped from a volatile late-autumn average to a stable winter baseline of ~53 units (Periods 43-45).

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm that the SKU '717464001' (a jersey vest top) has entered a stable winter baseline regime starting around Period 43 (Dec 2). The average demand over the last four periods (Periods 43-46) is 45.25 units, significantly lower than the volatile spikes seen in late autumn. Given that this is a basic vest top, demand is expected to remain low but stable through January. On-hand inventory is currently 193 units with no units in transit. Since the current on-hand inventory (193) already covers more than 4 weeks of the current demand regime (~45 units/week), and the lead time is consistently 0, the objective is to maintain a level that avoids excessive holding costs while protecting against minor volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this stable winter baseline (Avg=45.25). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to account for the reduced volatility in this period.
