The OR recommendation of 186 aligns well with the recent 4-week average (184.5).

The OR recommendation is 157 units, which is slightly above the recent average of 132.5 but well within the range of observed demand (158 last period). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to the profit ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning safety stock should be minimal to avoid expensive overstocking. 4.

The product description ('IZZY TEE', 'short cap sleeves', 'sport') suggests seasonal relevance for spring/early summer activities.

However, the OR's uncapped base stock logic is likely being restricted by its cap or its reliance on the full history (including the lower February demands). 4. Final Strategy: To cover the current demand regime (~190-220 units) and account for the minimal starting inventory (6 units), I need to place an order that ensures available stock is closer to 220+. Given the almost 1:1 ratio of profit to holding cost (q=0.5), the OR baseline aims for the median, but the inventory risk of stockouts at these levels is high.

A base-stock level minus 62 on-hand results in 109, implying a base-stock target of ~171 units.\n5. Strategy: A base-stock of 171 is too low given demand peaked at ~220 recently. Since profit equals holding cost (q=0.5), we should target the expected mean demand. I estimate next period demand at ~190.

Recent demand has been extremely low, averaging ~4 units per period since September, with the last four periods recording 3, 2, 3, and 1 units respectively.

However, since the cost of a stockout (missing $1 profit) equals the cost of holding (paying $1), and demand is near zero, it is safer and more cost-effective to hold minimal stock.
