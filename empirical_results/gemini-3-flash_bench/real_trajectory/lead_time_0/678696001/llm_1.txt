The most recent observation (Feb 04) was 201, suggesting a rising trend as the weather warms. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive in the current period's 'Arrival Resolution' phase and be available for the current period's demand. d) Inventory: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. e) Order Logic: To meet immediate demand and build a small safety buffer for an expected seasonal upturn, I will target approximately 220 units.
