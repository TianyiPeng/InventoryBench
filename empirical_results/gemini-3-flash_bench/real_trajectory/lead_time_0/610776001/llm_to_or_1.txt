Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 610776001 (Women's Jersey T-shirt). Demand data for the past 5 weeks shows a mean of 157.4 and a standard deviation of 40.5. The most recent demand (2019-02-04) was 212, signaling a potential upward trend as we move towards spring/summer seasonality for basic t-shirts. Promised lead time (L) is 0. Since we have no on-hand inventory and the lead time is short, the priority is to establish a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current and next period. I will use the recent 5 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volume, while setting L to 'default' (0) as we have no evidence yet of lead-time drift. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target of roughly one week's demand plus safety stock.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a basic women's T-shirt. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 206, which is higher than the five pre-game historical samples (mean: 157.4). The lead time for Period 1 was observed as 0 periods (ordered and arrived in Period 1). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Based on the 5 pre-game samples plus the observed Period 1 demand (145, 144, 105, 181, 212, 206), the mean is 182.17. Since the product is a 'basic jersey t-shirt' and we are transitioning from mid-February towards spring, demand might be stabilizing at a higher level than the early January lows. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the more recent trend of higher demand (181, 212, 206).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Tilly (1)' is a t-shirt in the 'Womens Everyday Basics' category. We are currently in late February (Period 3), entering the spring season where demand for basics and shirts typically increases. Historical demand samples (145, 144, 105, 181, 212) show a general upward trend followed by even higher demand in Period 1 (206) and Period 2 (239). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. However, in both Period 1 and Period 2, we stocked out (ending inventory = 0), indicating that the current base stock calculation is underestimating demand. To capture the recent growth and prepare for spring seasonality, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (averaging 212, 206, and 239) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. This should raise the base stock enough to prevent further stockouts while maintaining the efficiency of the 0-period lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's t-shirt ('Tilly'). The game is currently in early March (Period 4). History shows a clear upward trend in demand: Period 1 (206), Period 2 (239), and Period 3 (350), which is common for basic apparel moving into spring. Notably, the actual lead time is 0 periods (same-period arrival), but the system has been stocking out because it only orders based on previous period statistics while demand is accelerating. Period 3 demand (350) represents a significant jump (+46% from Period 2). To prevent further lost sales, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this upward trajectory, while keeping L at default (0) as verified by history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting 2019-02-11: Demand is trending upward from ~200 to 350+ as spring season approaches. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $971.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776001 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which is entering the spring season (March). Historical demand shows a significant upward shift starting in February (Period 3 saw demand of 350, though Period 4 settled at 260). The mean demand over the last 4 periods is ~264, but the earlier pre-February samples were much lower (~154 average). Given the product type and the 2019/3/11 date, I expect sustained higher demand compared to the initial January baseline. Observed lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in N arrive in N). I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new higher-demand regime while smoothing out the volatility between Period 3 and 4. Setting L to 'default' as the promised 0-period lead time is performing reliably.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's T-shirt, which is entering peak spring seasonality. Demand has shown a clear upward shift since February (Period 1-2 demand was ~222, Period 3-5 demand averaged ~285). Recent history shows demand peaked at 350 in Period 3 and has since settled around 245-260 in Periods 4 and 5. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all concluded periods. To avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 1-3, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current higher volume regime (averaging 285 units). On-hand is currently 71 units, which is a good buffer, but we must maintain inventory levels to meet the sustained higher demand entering mid-March.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's T-shirt, which is entering peak spring/summer season (late March). Historically, demand for Periods 1-6 has averaged 257 units, but Period 3 showed a spike to 350. Periods 4-6 stabilized at a lower mean (~249), likely due to high initial stocking or transient fluctuations. With 91 units on hand and a confirmed 0-period lead time, I need to set parameters that capture the high-end potential for the upcoming spring surge while acknowledging recent stability. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend since the start of the simulation, as the previous carry-over insight noted a shift to 350+ that hasn't fully sustained, suggesting high volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'calculate' because 0-period arrivals are consistently confirmed.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the product is a women's lightweight T-shirt, which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Demand in Period 7 spiked significantly to 448 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks: 350, 260, 245, 242, 448) show high volatility and a recent sharp increase likely due to April warming. The mean of the last 4 periods is ~300, but I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the variation between the earlier peak (350) and the recent spike (448) while smoothing the dip in between. Given the stockout risk for a high-demand seasonal basic, the backend will target a ~80% service level based on the $4 profit/$1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 7 confirmed a significant seasonal demand spike (448 units) as of 2019-03-25, reinforcing the spring upward trend previously noted; stockouts are currently the primary risk despite 0-period lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is seeing a seasonal demand increase as we move deeper into spring. Historical demand since Period 3 shows a significantly higher mean than the initial samples, with a notable spike in Period 7 (448 units) and sustained high demand in Period 8 (382 units). The last 3 periods (P6-P8) have averaged 357 units. Lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all concluded transactions. To prevent stockouts and capitalize on the spring seasonal trend, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (recent_N=3) to focus on the current high-demand regime, and use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes. L will remain at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand from Period 6-8 is ~357 units, a significant increase from the initial average of ~150-200. This aligns with spring seasonality for T-shirts.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776001 (Women's T-shirt) is in a high-demand spring phase. Current date is April 15, 2019. Over the last 4 periods (Periods 6-9), demand has been 242, 448, 382, and 284, averaging ~339 units per week. While Period 9 saw a dip to 284, the overall trend since March remains significantly higher than the initial January/February levels. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). With Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the backend aims for a base stock at the 80th percentile. Current on-hand is 162. Given the volatility (standard deviation remains high due to the Period 7 peak of 448), I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime using N=4 (covering the sustained shift) and use recent volatility for sigma_hat to ensure we capture the spring peaks without over-ordering during minor dips.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776001 (Women's T-shirt) is in a high-demand spring regime. The current date is 2019/4/22. Over the last 4 periods (P7-P10), demand has been 448, 382, 284, and 273, showing a stabilization after the initial spring spike. The mean demand for these 4 periods is ~347. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this current settled high-demand level, which is higher than the early season but lower than the peak of 448. This ensures we don't over-order on the tail end of the spring peak while maintaining enough stock to prevent stockouts (which occurred frequently in earlier periods). I am setting L to default (0) as it has been reliably 0.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU '610776001' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) continues to exhibit strong seasonal spring demand. Reviewing recent history: Period 7 (448), Period 8 (382), Period 9 (284), Period 10 (273), and Period 11 (410). The demand appears highly volatile but maintains a high average compared to the start of the year. The mean of the last 5 periods (Periods 7-11) is 359.4, which aligns with the high-demand regime identified in carry-over insights. Lead time is reliably 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of only 7 units, we need a robust base stock to avoid stockouts during this peak season. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this high-demand spring phase and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the high variance (std dev \u2248 79 over the last 5 periods), ensuring the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to satisfy the upper end of the demand distribution.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in the middle of the spring/summer peak for Women's Everyday Basics T-shirts (SKU 610776001). Historical data from the last 5 periods (Periods 8-12: demand 382, 284, 273, 410, 345) shows a high-demand regime with a mean of ~339 units and significant volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed to meet that period's demand. I am setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current high-demand plateau observed during April and early May, as earlier data from February (mean ~150-200) is no longer representative of the peak season. Setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 will calibrate the safety stock to the high variance seen in this recent window, protecting against frequent stockouts observed in earlier peak weeks (e.g., Period 7).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which is a spring/summer seasonal item. We are currently in mid-May (2019-05-13). Reviewing history, a major regime shift occurred around Period 3/4 as we entered spring, with demand jumping from under 200 to a range of 240-450 units. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13) is 318.4, and for the last 10 periods (Periods 4-13) is 317.9, demonstrating a relatively stable but high-variance regime. The lead time is consistently 0. Given the high variance (e.g., jump from 280 to 410, and 242 to 448), I will use the last 10 periods to capture enough volatility (sigma) while reflecting the current seasonal mean (mu). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the seasonal peak and the inherent unpredictability in weekly demand for basics.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776001 (Women's T-shirt) is in a high-demand regime consistent with late spring and nearing early summer (May 20). Period 14 (May 13) showed demand of 309 units. Over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), the mean demand has stabilized around 323 units (273, 410, 345, 280, 309). This is significantly higher than the initial pre-February mean but appears to have plateaued compared to the peak seen in Period 7. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this stable high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the current volatility (standard deviation ~54 over that window). L remains at the default promised lead time of 0.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-27. We are managing a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is in peak spring/early summer season. Demand has remained consistently elevated compared to the initial periods. Over the last 10 periods (since Period 6), the mean demand has been approximately 312 units, with a standard deviation of 66. This is significantly higher than the initial weeks and more reflective of the current seasonal baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level (80% target given the $4 profit/$1 holding cost ratio) and prevent stockouts seen earlier, I am using a recent window (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the high-demand volatility observed in March and April against the slightly more stable, but still high, demand throughout May.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime (Period 6-15): Mean demand ~312 units, \u03c3 ~66. Lead time confirmed stable at 0 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. We are in the peak summer season for the 'Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Period 16 concluded with a stockout (sold 387 units but demand was 392), despite having starting on-hand inventory of 387. This indicates that even with high stock levels, current demand is exceeding our previous forecasts. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 12-16), demand has been {345, 280, 309, 337, 392}, averaging ~333 units. However, given the most recent spike to 392 and the peak summer context, I am shifting the mu_hat focus slightly more toward the recent high-volume weeks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility, high-demand summer regime while reacting to the stockout in Period 16.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a lightweight T-shirt, which is in peak demand during the summer season. Performance over the last several periods (Period 11-17) shows a mean demand of approximately 347 units (up from the 312 noted in previous insights). Recent demand samples are 410, 345, 280, 309, 337, 392, and 357. This suggests a slightly elevated and potentially more volatile regime as we enter the height of summer. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To ensure we capture this sustained high demand while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a recent window (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This balances the need to be responsive to the summer peak while smoothing out localized fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed: Mean demand for Periods 11-17 increased to ~347 units (compared to the previous ~312), reflecting seasonal relevance for lightweight jerseys in June.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are in the middle of the summer season for this 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which has shown a sustained high-demand regime. Average demand over the last 8 periods (Periods 11-18) is approximately 343.5 units (410, 345, 280, 309, 337, 392, 357, 318), confirming the summer peak mentioned in previous carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I am using recent_N=8 to capture this specific summer demand level for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current seasonality while using the high critical ratio (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) to avoid stockouts.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

As of Period 20 (late June), demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt remains in its summer peak regime. The mean demand over the last 9 periods (P11-P19) is approximately 342 units with a standard deviation of 41 units. Lead time is reliably 0 periods. Given we are in the peak summer season, I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this specific seasonal demand level. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand (L+1 = 1) while maintaining a service level consistent with a 0.8 critical ratio.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. We are in the peak of the summer season for this 'Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Historically, demand has been robust since mid-April (Period 11), with a mean demand of approximately 342 units over the last 10 periods (P11-P20). While there were peaks around 390-410 units, the most recent four periods (P17-P20) show a slightly more stabilized mean of 332.5 units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in history. Inventory is currently at 50 units on-hand. I will utilize a recent_N strategy for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=10 to capture the sustained summer regime while smoothing out weekly fluctuations. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 1+L (1 period) risk window at a high service level (profit/cost ratio is 4:1, suggesting an 80% service level target).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is strongly seasonal. We are currently in the mid-summer period. Reviewing the last 5 periods (Periods 17-21), demand has been consistently high (357, 318, 329, 326), but Period 21 saw a significant drop to 223 units. This drop may signal the beginning of a post-peak summer decline as the retail cycle often starts transitioning away from core summer items in July. However, because it is only one data point, I will maintain a fairly robust stock level but start biasing the forecast towards the most recent window (N=5) to capture the possible downward shift without overreacting. The lead time remains firmly at 0 periods, allowing for quick replenishment. Setting L to default (0), mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent average of ~310 units/period, and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility (~52).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical data shows that demand for this SKU (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) has entered a declining phase following the early summer peak. Demand in Period 21 was 223 and Period 22 was 173, significantly lower than the June average of ~330-350. This downward trend suggests that the mid-summer peak is over. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs in a falling market, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use a shorter window (recent_N=3) to capture this recent deceleration quickly. Using N=3 (Periods 20, 21, and 22: demands 326, 223, 173) results in a mean of 240.6 and handles the drop-off more effectively than using a longer history which is still biased by the high June numbers.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed starting Period 21 (July): Demand has dropped from a June average of ~334 to a July average of ~198, reflecting the end of the summer peak for this T-shirt SKU.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776001 (Women's T-shirt) has transitioned from its early summer peak into a lower-demand late-summer/pre-fall regime. As observed in the carry-over insights, the demand dropped significantly starting in July (Period 21). Demand for the last three completed periods (P21-P23) has been 223, 173, and 161 respectively, resulting in a mean of 185.6 units. This is a clear downward shift from the June average of ~334 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To align with this new lower demand regime and avoid excess holding costs, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilization at a lower level. Current on-hand inventory is 146, which is nearly sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~185 without a large new order, allowing the OR backend to naturally taper down stock levels.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776001 (Women's T-shirt) has transitioned from its summer peak (June mean ~334) to a significantly lower late-summer demand regime starting in July (Period 21). The demand for the last four completed periods (P21-P24) has been 223, 173, 161, and 173 respectively, resulting in a mean of approximately 182.5 units. This downward shift is sustained and reflects seasonal cooling for basic jersey T-shirts as the market moves away from peak summer. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower late-July demand level specifically.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. We are in a confirmed downward demand regime following the summer peak (June). The 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 23 noted that demand dropped significantly in July. Looking at the last 5 periods (21-25), demand values have been 223, 173, 161, 173, and 111, with a clear downward trend continuing into August. The mean of these last 5 samples is 168.2. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 0 periods through observation of 'Period X conclude' messages. To avoid overstocking as the season winds down further, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand levels. Since L=0, mu_hat represents the demand forecast for the current period (1+0). With profit=$4 and holding cost=$1, the target service level is 80%, which the OR engine will manage using these parameters.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical demand shows a confirmed downward shift since Period 21 (early July). Demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) has averaged approximately 156 units, descending from the summer peak of ~330-350. Specifically, the last three periods (P24-P26) have shown a tighter range of 96-173 (average ~127). The product is a lightweight T-shirt, and we are moving out of the peak summer retail season. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs as demand cools further, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture the post-peak mean (~156). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility. This configuration targets a base stock that covers the expected lower demand while the 0-period lead time allows for rapid adjustment if demand spikes unexpectedly.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt shows a clear decline as summer ends, moving from a June/July peak into a late August trough. Following the regime shift identified in Period 23, demand has continued to decrease steadily: the last 5 periods (P23-P27) show an average demand of 125 units, while the last 3 periods (P25-P27) show a further decrease to 97 units. With current on-hand inventory at 112 units, the focus is on avoiding excess holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this downward trend and use a more responsive recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the reduced volatility in the lower-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer peak (August) has stabilized at a lower regime; mean demand for P25-P27 is approximately 97 units, down from the July average of ~198.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-26. We are in a post-summer demand regime for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. As noted in the Period 28 carry-over insight, demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the summer peak. Analyzing the most recent four periods (P25-P28), demand values were 111, 96, 84, and 110. The mean of these observations is 100.25 units with a standard deviation of approximately 12.6. As we approach September, demand for summer-specific items typically continues to taper or stay low. I will use recent_N (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in August (P25-P28) at a mean of ~100 units, significantly down from the July average of ~198.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776001 (Women's T-shirt) has entered a stable low-demand regime following the end of the summer peak. The current period is 2019-09-02, which historically marks the transition from late summer into early autumn for basics. Demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) has been consistently low with values of 111, 96, 84, 110, and 109, resulting in a mean of approximately 102 units and a standard deviation of 11.5. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current regime and avoid over-ordering based on the high summer volumes seen in earlier history. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment to demand fluctuations. This approach maintains a low inventory level to minimize holding costs while providing sufficient coverage for the current demand level.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The SKU is a lightweight t-shirt, which has seen its demand regime shift significantly relative to its summer peak. In August (Periods 25-28), demand stabilized at a mean of ~100. However, in the most recent two periods (P29-P30), demand has stayed low/declined further (109 followed by 74), with P30 being the lowest demand observation since the start of the year. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Given that we are now entering September, a further cooling of demand for t-shirts is expected. I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 to capture the stabilized August/early September mean (~98 units), which prevents overreacting to the single low data point of 74 while acknowledging the post-summer low-demand regime. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 will provide a volatility estimate reflecting this lower-volume period (std approx 15). Parameters are set to manage a 0-period lead time environment where the goal is to satisfy the current period's demand without overstocking as the season ends.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU shows a clear seasonal pattern: a spring/summer peak followed by a sharp decline starting in July. Demand has stabilized into a lower autumn regime. Over the last 5 periods (P27-P31), demand values were 84, 110, 109, 74, and 72, resulting in a mean of approximately 90 units. This is significantly lower than the ~300+ units seen during the summer. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs during this low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this established lower regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level appropriate for the current demand environment while maintaining high service levels with minimal holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in September (P29-P31) at a lower mean of ~85 units, confirming the end of summer/late-August fluctuations and the beginning of a consistent autumn baseline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September (Period 33). Historical demand analysis shows a clear stabilization in a lower autumn regime following the end of the summer peak. For the last four periods (P29-P32), demand has been consistently low: 109, 74, 72, and 70 units respectively (mean \u2248 81). The carry-over insight from Period 32 correctly identified this shift to a lower baseline. Given the stability of the last three weeks (all near 70-74 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this specific post-summer regime. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'conclude' messages. The profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio suggests a target service level of 80% (z \u2248 0.84), which the OR backend will calculate. Given the current on-hand inventory of 36 units and a 0-period lead time, the system will order to bridge the gap to the base stock level.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 610776001 (Women's T-shirt) has stabilized into an autumn baseline after the summer peak and the late-August transition. For the most recent 5 periods (P29-P33), demand has been incredibly stable, with values of 109, 74, 72, 70, and 74 (mean ~80). The carry-over insight from Period 32 correctly identified this stabilization starting from P29. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To optimize for the current regime while capturing the low variance, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~80 units with a small buffer, which is appropriate given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) and the observed stability of the demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is fundamentally a seasonal summer basic. History shows demand peaked in June (~347 units) and has steadily declined through July and August. As of Period 32 (mid-September), demand stabilized at a lower autumn baseline. Looking at the last five periods (P30-P34), demand has been 74, 72, 70, 74, and 46. The drop to 46 in Period 34 indicates a potential further reduction as the weather cools in October. To reflect this recent stabilization and slight downward trend, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~67) and volatility of this autumn regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Historical data for this Women's jersey T-shirt shows a clear seasonal decline from its summer high (avg ~350 units) to an autumn baseline. Over the last four periods (P32-P35), demand has dropped further, averaging ~56 units (70, 74, 46, 34). This suggests the 'autumn baseline' of ~85 identified in Period 32 has shifted to a late-autumn/winter regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this move towards ~56 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. Setting sigma_hat with recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility inherent in the lower demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P34: Mean demand has decreased from ~85 to ~56 units, reflecting late-autumn cooling for this lightweight jersey product.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which is highly seasonal. We are currently in Period 37 (2019/10/21), late autumn. Carry-over insights and recent history (P34-P36) confirm a significant downward demand shift as temperatures drop: demand for the last three periods has been 46, 34, and 43, averaging 41 units. This is a sharp decline from the September average of ~74 units and the summer peak of ~340 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs ($1.0/unit) for a low-margin item ($4.0 profit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new, lower demand regime (approx 41 units/period). This ensures the base stock reflects the current cooling trend rather than the higher historical averages.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019, entering late autumn/early winter. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is seasonally declining in demand. Period 37 concluded with a stockout (sold 47 against demand of 49), leaving 0 on-hand inventory. Since P34, demand has shifted to a lower regime. Observations: P34 (46), P35 (34), P36 (43), P37 (49). The average for these last 4 periods is 43 units. While P37 saw a slight uptick, the overall trend since summer is downward. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this late-autumn low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The backend will target a base stock level that balances the $4 profit and $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a late-autumn demand regime for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Demand has significantly decreased from its summer peaks and even from the early autumn levels. In the last 5 periods (P34-P38), demand values were 46, 34, 43, 49, and 24, averaging approximately 39 units. The drop to 24 units in Period 38 suggests a potential further cooling as we head into winter. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this lower late-autumn mean of ~39 units while acknowledging the downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for rapid response to stockouts if demand spikes unexpectedly.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is experiencing a late-autumn demand decline. Since Period 34 (late September), demand has shifted to a lower regime. Analyzing the last 6 periods (P34-P39), the demand values are [46, 34, 43, 49, 24, 43], resulting in a mean of approximately 39.8 units and a standard deviation of 8.9. This is a significant drop from the ~85 units seen in September and the ~56 units noted in the P36 carry-over. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs for a seasonal item entering winter, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current low-demand baseline while maintaining a safety stock that reflects the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized in late autumn (P34-P39): Mean demand has further decreased to ~40 units (from ~56 in P36), confirming the waning seasonal relevance of lightweight jerseys in November.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is late autumn heading into winter. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is highly seasonal and currently in a low-demand regime. Historical demand since Period 34 (late Sept) has shown a clear decline: 46, 34, 43, 49, 24, 43, 30. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P34-P40) is approximately 38.4 units. Period 40's demand was 30 units, suggesting the downward trend or low baseline is holding steady. I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-autumn baseline (38.4 units) while ensuring we don't overstock as winter approaches. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in the history.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a late-autumn/winter period for this 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which has seen a sustained decline in demand since July. The most recent demand regime (P38-P41) shows demand values of 24, 43, 30, and 25. The mean of these last 4 periods is approximately 30.5 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs for this seasonal item at the end of its cycle, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=4 to capture this localized baseline. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the OR backend will target an 80% service level, which is appropriate for balancing stockout risk versus holding inventory in a low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late Nov (P38-P41) at a mean of ~30.5 units, continuing the downward seasonal trend for lightweight jerseys.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). This SKU is a lightweight T-shirt, which has shown a clear downward seasonal demand trend since the summer peak. The latest demand regime (P38-P42) shows an average demand of approximately 33.8 units (24, 43, 30, 25, 47). Although Period 42 saw a slightly higher demand of 47 units, the overall trend for late autumn/early winter remains low. The Lead Time is confirmed stable at 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 units last period. To capture the current stabilizing low-demand regime while allowing for the slight volatility seen in Period 42, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This aligns with the 'late autumn' baseline established in November and early December.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late autumn/early winter (P38-P42) at a mean of ~33.8 units, reflecting the seasonal baseline for lightweight jerseys in December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which is highly seasonal. We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9). Previous carry-over insights indicate the demand has stabilized at a low winter baseline. Specifically, from P38 to P43 (the last 6 periods), demand has been: 24, 43, 30, 25, 47, 20. The average demand over this 6-period regime is 31.5 units, with a standard deviation of 10.9. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Given the high criticality of stockouts in this environment (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), and the slight fluctuation in recent demand (a peak of 47 and a low of 20), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this late-autumn/winter regime. This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer based on the recent volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its lowest seasonal demand phase (December). Demand has stabilized at a low baseline. Analyzing the most recent periods (P38-P44), the mean demand is approx 30.7 units (24, 43, 30, 25, 47, 20, 19). The target service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this low-demand winter period while maintaining the 80% service level, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the current late-autumn/early-winter regime (starting from Period 38). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current ~31 unit mean rather than the higher yearly average.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-Christmas week. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), which is seasonally low in late December. Over the last 8 periods (P38-P45), demand has fluctuated between 19 and 47 units, with a mean of 30.375. Specifically, the last three periods (P43-P45) demand values were 20, 19, and 35. While there might be a slight holiday bump in the very recent data, the overall regime since November (P40-P45) is consistently low, averaging ~29.3 units. Given the 0-period lead time, the risk of stockout is low, and the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0 suggests we should maintain a lean inventory to avoid carrying stock into the even slower post-holiday January period. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current late-autumn/early-winter baseline while staying responsive to the slight volatility seen in the last week.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a low-seasonal regime suitable for winter. Reviewing the last 5 periods (P42-P46), demand has been 47, 20, 19, 35, and 22, resulting in a mean of 28.6 units. This is consistent with the 'Period 43' carry-over insight indicating a baseline of ~33.8 units. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To accurately capture this late-winter demand while minimizing holding costs for a low-turnover period, I will use a recent_N of 5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand plus a safety buffer appropriate for the observed volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 11.7) in this regime.
