The actual demand in P1 and P2 exceeded the inventory ordered, resulting in stockouts. Inventory Analysis: Starting on-hand is 0. Both previous orders (P1, P2) had an actual lead time of 0 periods, arriving in the same period they were ordered. Lead-Time Inference: Observed lead time (0) matches promised (0). Demand Analysis: Short-term demand is clearly rising as we move into late February/March (approaching Spring). The OR recommendation of 216 is based on a conservative empirical mean (approx. 175) and a cap. However, actual demand has been consistently higher (206, 239) and we have stocked out twice. I will override the OR recommendation to account for the clear upward trend and to prevent a third consecutive stockout.

However, this recommendation is heavily dampened by the lower demand samples from early January (105-181) and does not fully account for the recent surge to 350. Since the critical fractile is 0.8 ($4 profit / ($4 + $1 holding)), we should be aggressive in covering demand. \n\nFinal Strategy: To avoid another stockout, I will override the OR recommendation of 262 and order 360 units.

Given the 0-period lead time, this effectively prepares for a demand of roughly 330. 5. Strategy: A target stock level of 330-350 is appropriate given the 284-448 range observed in the spring surge. The OR recommendation of 173 (total 327) is slightly conservative given the potential for another spike, but reasonable to avoid overstocking as we move further into April.

Analysis of the recent history shows a clear and sustained decline in demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt as summer ends. Specifically, demand has dropped from ~330 (June) to ~170 (July) and now to ~90 (early August). Historically, the last three periods recorded demands of 111, 96, and 84. The OR algorithm is pulling from a long history that includes the high-volume spring and summer peaks, leading to an inflated base-stock level. With a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, I can afford to order close to the expected weekly demand. My current on-hand inventory is 89 units, which almost covers another week of demand at the current rate (~84-90 units).
