Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 664319001 (Women's Trousers). Historical demand from the last 5 weeks averages 17 units (17, 14, 24, 12, 18). As we move into mid-February, we are entering the pre-Spring retail season where demand for 'Everyday Collection' trousers typically remains stable or begins a slight upward trend. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent month's behavior more heavily than the global average. The promised lead time is 0; since we have no delivery history yet, I will use 'default' for L. The backend will calculate base stock using the provided profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) to target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate for a standard fashion item starting with zero inventory.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's paperwaist trouser. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 - Feb 4) are: 17, 14, 24, 12, 18 (Mean: 17). Period 1 actual demand was 14. Total samples available: 6. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time 0), confirming L=0 is currently accurate. Demand appears stable around the mean of 16.5-17. On-hand is 11. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most relevant demand mean and variance while maintaining a safety buffer for the current 'Everyday Collection' trousers which generally have steady demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. Looking at the demand history (Feb 4th: 18, Feb 11th: 14, Feb 18th: 26) and the provided pre-game samples (avg ~17), we see a significant jump to 26 in the most recent period. As this is part of the 'Womens Everyday Collection', we might be seeing the start of a spring season demand shift. Inventory is currently 0 with nothing in-transit, following a stockout in Period 2 (sold 24 out of 26 demanded). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent upward trend while maintaining stability, and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility. L remains at the promised 0.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 is a 'women's paperwaist tapered trouser' in the everyday collection. Current date is March 4, 2019. Observed demand over the last 8 weeks (including pre-game samples) has been: 17, 14, 24, 12, 18 (pre-game) and 14, 26, 16 (game history), yielding a mean of 17.6. There is a slight uptick in demand over the last 3 periods (average 18.6) compared to the pre-game mean, which aligns with early spring seasonality for lightweight trousers. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 13 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent slight increase in volume as we enter the spring season, and 'default' for sigma to maintain a conservative safety buffer given the high stockout in Period 2 (sold 24 vs demand 26). Setting L to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $193.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Tiblisi paperwaist tapered' trouser for women. The current date is March 11, 2019. Historically (Jan-Feb), demand averages around 17 units per week (samples: 17, 14, 24, 12, 18). Since starting the simulation, past 4 periods demand has been 14, 26, 16, 11 (mean = 16.75). There is a slight spike in Period 2 (2019/2/18), but generally, demand is stable. No significant seasonal trend for mid-March is yet observed in the data. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (ordered and arrived same period). On-hand inventory is 16. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (5 historical samples + 4 game periods) to capture the base demand level while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock. Lead time remains at the default (0).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' paper bag waist trouser. Looking at demand history (17, 14, 24, 12, 18, 14, 26, 16, 11, 12), the mean demand is roughly 16.4 units per period. The recent demand (last 3 periods: 16, 11, 12) is slightly lower than the initial weeks but generally stable around the 15-18 range. Promised lead time (L=0) has consistently held true across all 5 periods. There are no missing shipments. A base stock policy covering current demand + lead time (0 periods) will be maintained. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand stability and standard deviation while slightly prioritizing the recent slight downtrend compared to the early February peak.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, transitioning from late winter to early spring. The product is a women's paperwaist tapered trouser, a transition-season staple. Historical demand has fluctuated between 8 and 26 units. In the last 3 weeks (Periods 4-6), demand has softened (11, 12, 8; mean=10.3). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 18. Given the product's alignment with early spring fashion, I expect demand to stabilize or slightly increase from the recent dip. Using recent_N (N=6) captures the full game history mean (~14.5) while balancing against the very recent drop, ensuring we don't over-stock while the inventory position is relatively healthy (18 units) compared to current demand levels.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a pair of women's trousers from the 'Everyday Collection'. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 7 completed periods. Historical demand shows variability but no clear seasonal trend yet (14, 26, 16, 11, 12, 8, 24). The mean demand over the last 7 periods is approximately 15.9, while the full history (including pre-game samples) averages around 16.5. Last period (P7) saw a spike to 24 units, depleting inventory to 1 unit. Given the erratic nature of the recent demand (8 then 24), using a recent window (N=5) for mu_hat will capture the current mean (approx 13.8) while the OR backend's high service level target (based on $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, q = 0.95) will ensure sufficient safety stock to cover spikes. I will stick with the promised lead time (L=0) as it has been perfectly reliable.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a pair of women's trousers (Tiblisi paperwaist tapered). Period 9 starts on 2019/04/08. Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged 16.75, but the last two weeks (2019/3/25 and 2019/4/1) saw a significant jump to 24 and 23 units, respectively. This likely aligns with the onset of spring and increased demand for 'Womens Everyday Collection' woven trousers. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. My on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), so I need to ensure the base stock covers this rising demand trend. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma to capture this recent upward movement while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 7: Average demand increased from ~14.5 (P1-P6) to ~23.5 (P7-P8) coinciding with early spring fashion seasonality.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's paperwaist trouser, which is highly seasonal for spring. Historical demand has significantly increased over the last three periods: P7 (24), P8 (23), and P9 (32), averaging 26.33 units. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' regarding a regime shift. Lead time consistently remains 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (2 units) with no units in transit. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand spring phase, I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the current elevated demand level and its recent volatility, while sticking to the calculated lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and maturing: Average demand for P7-P9 increased to 26.3 units (+81% vs early periods), driven by spring fashion seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $665.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tiblisi paperwaist tapered' trousers has spiked significantly with the arrival of spring (April). Period 10 recorded a massive demand of 56 units, which exhausted all 35 units of on-hand/arriving stock, resulting in a stockout. The average demand for the most recent regime (P7-P10) is 33.75 units, but the last period (56) suggests a deepening peak. The product description (paper bag waist, tapered legs) aligns perfectly with spring/summer female fashion trends. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this peak, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the higher demand average of 33.75 (across 1+L=1 periods), while using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (Std Dev of P7-P10 is ~15.5) and ensure the OR backend sets a higher base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Period 10 demand (56) is more than double the P1-P6 average, indicating a seasonal peak rather than just a shift. Average demand for P7-P10 is 33.75 (+130% vs baseline).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664319001' (Womens Trousers) is experiencing a massive seasonal demand surge typical of late spring fashion. Demand has grown exponentionally from a baseline of ~14 (P1-P6) to 24 (P7), 23 (P8), 32 (P9), 56 (P10), and 95 (P11). I have completely stocked out in the last two periods because the OR engine's internal forecast, constrained by historical averages, is lagging behind this rapid growth. On-hand and in-transit are currently 0. To prevent another stockout and capture the peak of this trend, I am using the 'explicit' method to override the mu_hat. I forecast a demand of 110 units for Period 12 based on the 70% growth rate observed between P10 and P11. I am also increasing sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility during this peak period. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge accelerated significantly in Period 11 (95 units, +70% vs P10), confirming a rapid seasonal peak for the spring collection.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664319001' (Womens Trousers) is experiencing a massive seasonal surge as we enter May. Demand has escalated rapidly: P9 (32), P10 (56), P11 (95), and P12 (151). The average of the last 4 periods is 83.5, but the movement is clearly trending upward rather than stabilizing. To avoid stockouts during this peak spring fashion window, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this growth trend, while being mindful that Period 12 demand (151) suggests the next period could be significantly higher. Since lead time is consistently 0, the backend will calculate base_stock as (1+0)*mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Using N=4 for mu_hat provides a mean of 83.5; however, given the steep climb, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 160 to ensure we meet the likely demand of 150+ units, as the 'recent_N' average would under-order against the current momentum. Sigma_hat remains on 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility seen in the surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge hyper-acceleration: Period 12 demand reached 151 units, a 59% increase over Period 11 (95) and nearly 5x the early April levels, confirming a strong seasonal peak for women's trousers.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (May 13), tracking the 'Tiblisi paperwaist tapered' trousers. Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal peak: demand ramped up from ~14 (Feb/Mar) to a high of 151 in Period 12 (late April), before dropping to 111 in Period 13 (early May). This suggests the peak of the spring season has likely passed, and demand is entering a late-spring/early-summer stabilization or decline phase. Period 13 saw a significant over-order relative to the falling demand, resulting in 135 units on-hand. Lead time has consistently been 0. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for the current demand level, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most representative data from the peak/post-peak phase (Period 11: 95, Period 12: 151, Period 13: 111). The average of these is 119. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level, but the 135 units already on hand will likely result in a small or zero order this period if demand continues to soften.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge peaked in Period 12 (151) and began decelerating in Period 13 (111, -26%), signaling a transition into the late-spring regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3173.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tiblisi paperwaist tapered' trousers has exhibited extreme volatility and a clear seasonal boom-and-bust cycle. After a major demand surge to 151 units (P12), demand dropped to 111 (P13) and then rebounded sharply to 171 (P14). The product is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Given the high demand in P14 (171) and the previous period's drop, we are in a 'late-spring' regime where demand is high but erratic. I will use a recent_N (N=4) to capture the high-volume volatility (P11-P14: 95, 151, 111, 171) which yields a mean of 132 units and a high standard deviation. Since L=0, the base stock targets (1+L) * mean. This setting ensures the OR backend places a significant order to replenish the current stockout while accounting for the high coefficient of variation in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed as high-volatility late-spring: P11-P14 average is 132 units with significant period-to-period swings (95 to 171), necessitating higher safety stock to avoid secondary stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2250.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the late-spring season (late May) for womens trousers. Historical demand for the last five periods (P11-P15) has been 95, 151, 111, 171, and 122. This shows a high but volatile demand regime with an average of 130 units and a standard deviation of approximately 30 units. The most recent demand (P15: 122) follows a spike (P14: 171), confirming the high volatility noted in carry-over insights. Total on-hand inventory is 68. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this high-volume, high-variance stage, I am using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover the potential for another spike toward 170 units while accounting for the current inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Late-spring demand regime (P11-P15) established: average demand 130 units, standard deviation ~30 units; highly volatile with swings between 95 and 171 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. Historical data confirms the product is in a high-demand late-spring/early-summer regime. The demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has averaged 140.4 units with significant volatility (std dev ~24). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 34 units with zero in-transit, following a period where demand (147) nearly exhausted the available stock. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the target service level is high (~95%). I will use a recent_N strategy (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime while ensuring the OR backend calculates a sufficient base stock to avoid stockouts during this peak seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Late-spring/early-summer demand regime (P12-P16) confirmed: average demand 140.4 units, with high volatility (range 111-171). Transition to summer seasonality should be monitored for potential late-June drop-off.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664319001' (Womens Everyday Collection paperwaist trousers) is currently in a high-demand late-spring/early-summer regime. The last period (P17) saw a demand of 171 units, matching the previous peak from P14. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P12-P17) is approximately 145.5 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 23.6 units. Since we are entering mid-June (P18: 2019/06/10), we are at the peak of summer fashion retail demand. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 9, in-transit: 0) following a high-sales period where we sold 171 units but only had 180 units available. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will continue using recent_N=6 to capture the current high-volume seasonal regime while ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest volatility and volume to protect against stockouts during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak sustained: Average demand for P12-P17 is 145.5 units, with P17 matching the season-high of 171 units. Peak summer demand for women's trousers is currently fully active.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1753.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, demand dropped to 97 units from a season-high average. This marks the first significant dip since the late-spring regime began, potentially signaling the start of the late-June drop-off usually associated with summer sales transitions or mid-season shifts. The current on-hand inventory is 90 units. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To manage the risk of overstocking if demand continues to soften while maintaining high service levels for the remainder of the summer season, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to encompass the peak volatility while reflecting the recent downturn. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=6) to capture the standard deviation of this high-volume period (avg ~133, std ~30). This balanced approach allows the OR engine to right-size the order given the current 90 units on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Potential demand deceleration detected. Period 18 demand (97) is 33% below the P12-P17 average (145.5). Monitoring for a shift from peak summer to late-summer regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3591.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, demand surged to 211 units, which is a significant increase from Period 18 (97) and exceeds the previous season high of 171. This contradicts the potential deceleration suspected in the last period and confirms that the summer peak is not only sustained but potentially intensifying as we approach late June. The SKU currently has 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, having stocked out in Period 19 despite a starting inventory of 189 units. Given the consistent 0-period lead time observed throughout the history, I will continue to use L=0. To address the recent volatility and the latest high-demand sample, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering Periods 15-19: 122, 147, 171, 97, 211) to capture the current high-mean regime (avg ~149.6). I will also use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance (std ~43) ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation is robust against another 200+ unit demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge hyper-peak: Period 19 demand reached an all-time high of 211 units, negating previous signs of deceleration and confirming extreme late-June volatility in the summer regime. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 149.6 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664319001' (Womens Everyday Trousers) is in its peak summer season (July 1st). Demand has entered an extremely volatile phase with a local high of 211 units in P19 and 175 units in P20. The current date (July) typically precedes a late-summer clearance or drop-off, but demand remains strong for now. The last 5 periods (P16-P20) show demand values of 147, 171, 97, 211, and 175, yielding a mean of 160.2 units and a high standard deviation. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To manage this high volatility and high profit margin ($19 profit vs $1 holding), I am using a recent_N (N=5) approach to capture the current summer peak while maintaining safety stock against the significant swings (e.g., the jump from 97 to 211). This ensures the base stock reflects the current 160+ unit regime rather than the lower season-to-date average.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed with extreme volatility: P16-P20 average demand increased to 160.2 units (up from ~140 in P12-P16), with a range of 97 to 211 units. Monitoring for July/August seasonal decline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical data confirms the product is in a high-demand, high-volatility summer peak regime. Demand for the last five periods (P17-P21) averaged 165.2 units, ranging from 97 to 211. The last two periods (P20: 175, P21: 172) show stabilization at a high level compared to the late-June spike (P19: 211). Current inventory is 58 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'conclude' messages. To maintain a high service level during this volatile peak and avoid stockouts seen in P19, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~165, and sigma_hat is set with recent_N (N=5) to account for the high standard deviation observed in this regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the peak demand while acknowledging the risk of stockouts given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime stabilization: P20-P21 demand settled at ~173 units following the P19 peak of 211, confirming sustained high demand through early July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the mid-to-late summer regime for women's trousers. Demand in Period 22 (100 units) showed a significant drop from the previous three weeks' average (~186 units), which suggests a possible seasonal deceleration as the peak summer season starts to wind down. However, historical volatility is high (ranging from 97 to 211 in the last six periods). To balance the risk of a continued downtrend against the high profit margin ($19 vs $1 holding cost), I am moving back to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation. This captures the high-demand summer era (P18-P22 average is ~151) while weighing the recent drop more than the full season average. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all 22 concluded periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential late-summer demand deceleration detected: Period 22 demand (100) is 43% below the P19-P21 average (186), suggesting a shift away from the hyper-peak summer regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (Women's Everyday Trousers) is entering late July (2019-07-22). Historical demand shows a confirmed shift from the hyper-peak summer regime (where demand reached 211 in P19) to a lower, late-summer level. Demand in the last two periods (P22: 100, P23: 122) is consistently lower than the P19-P21 average of 186. This aligns with the seasonal lifecycle of a spring/summer collection item. To avoid excess holding costs as demand continues to cool, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window (N=4) to capture this specific downward trend (P20-P23: 175, 172, 100, 122). L remains at the promised 0 periods as arrivals have been consistently same-period.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand for P22-P23 (avg: 111) is 40% lower than the P19-P21 peak (avg: 186), marking the end of the hyper-summer regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tiblisi paperwaist tapered' trousers has entered a volatile post-peak summer phase. Period 24 demand (178) rebounded significantly from the previous two periods (100, 122), showing that while the hyper-peak of P19 (211) has passed, demand remains robust and unpredictable. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P22-P24) is 133.3 units, compared to the earlier hyper-peak average of ~186. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this late-summer stabilization while accounting for the recent localized volatility. Historical lead time is consistently 0, so I will maintain the default lead time. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to adequately reflect the high standard deviation observed in the last few weeks, ensuring sufficient safety stock to cover demand spikes like the one seen in Period 24.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand stabilization: Following the transition from the hyper-peak, demand has stabilized into a volatile regime averaging ~133 units (P22-P24).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019/8/5. The SKU 664319001 (Women's Trousers) has transitioned from a hyper-peak summer regime (P19-P21 avg: 186) into a stable but volatile late-summer regime. Demand over the last 4 periods (P22-P25) has been 100, 122, 178, and 132, averaging 133 units. This confirms the 'late-summer demand stabilization' noted in the previous carry-over insight. Given the high volatility (std dev remains significant), I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture this current regime's mean and variance effectively. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock that covers the expected 133 units plus safety stock to handle the observed variance, ensuring high service levels during this volatile transition period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (Women's Everyday Trousers) is transitioning into a late-summer/early-autumn regime. Recent demand has stabilized into a lower, albeit volatile, range compared to the June/July hyper-peak (which saw demand up to 211). In Period 26, demand dropped to 90 units, the lowest since early June. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 124.4 units, significantly lower than the previous regime's average (~160). Given the date (August 12th), we expect a continued cooling of demand for this specifically summer-oriented 'paperbag' style as consumers pivot toward autumn collections. To reflect this deceleration while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (demand still bounced to 178 in P24), I am using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent month of post-peak sales data. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand for P22-P26 has dropped to 124.4 units, a ~22% decrease from the mid-summer peak average of ~160 units, showing a clear seasonal cooling through August.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (women's trousers) is currently in a late-summer cooling phase. Demand has significantly decelerated from the mid-summer hyper-peak (which saw demand up to 211 units). For the last three periods (P25-P27), demand has been 132, 90, and 81 units, showing a clear downward trend as we move into late August (Current Period 2019/8/19). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is 120.6 units, while the most recent two periods average only 85.5 units. Given the seasonality of trousers, we expect a transition toward autumn patterns soon, but for now, we must adjust to the immediate decline to avoid excessive holding costs. Inventory is currently at 100 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this deceleration (avg 120.6) and use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen during this transition (standard deviation in this window is approx 38). This allows the OR engine to maintain a buffer for volatility while recognizing the lower mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand deceleration reaching new lows: Period 26-27 demand (avg 85.5) is 45% lower than the early August average, confirming a sharp seasonal cooling as of mid-August.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tiblisi paperwaist tapered trousers (SKU 664319001) is entering a clear late-summer/pre-autumn decline. Demand in the most recent period (P28) dropped to 58 units, the lowest since early April. Over the last three cycles (P26-P28), demand has averaged 76.3 units, significantly down from the July/early-August average of ~130. Given the 'Womens Everyday Collection' nature, we expect demand to continue softening as the transition to fall collections begins in late August. Inventory is currently high (126 units on-hand), which exceeds the most recent weekly demand. To prevent overstocking and high holding costs during this seasonal cooling, I am setting mu_hat using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this immediate downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The OR backend will see that on-hand inventory (126) is likely sufficient to cover the required base stock for the current period, leading to a small or zero order.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal decline confirmed: Average demand for P26-P28 dropped to 76.3 units, a 43% decrease from the late-summer stabilization period (P22-P25 avg: 133), signaling the end-of-season for this woven trouser SKU.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 664319001 (paperwaist tapered trousers) is in a confirmed end-of-season decline. Current date is Sep 2, 2019. Demand has dropped from a mid-summer high of ~160 units to a three-period average (P27-P29) of 64.3 units (81, 58, 54). The most recent demand (54) represents a significant cooling compared to August highs. With 72 units on hand and a lead time of 0, the current inventory already covers more than one full period of expected demand given the current downward trend. Therefore, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this sharp seasonal drop-off while maintaining conservative stock levels to avoid holding costs on a declining fashion item. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season decline finalized: Demand for P27-P29 averaged 64.3 units, a 48% decrease from the late-summer stabilization (P22-P25 avg: 133). Stock levels should be managed aggressively to minimize terminal inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664319001' (Womens Everyday Collection Trousers) has clearly entered its end-of-season phase as of September 2019. Historical demand has plummeted from a mid-summer peak of ~160 units to an average of just 50.7 units over the last three periods (P28: 58, P29: 54, P30: 40). The Carry-Over Insights confirm this downward trend. With an current on-hand inventory of 49 units, we effectively have enough stock to cover approximately one week of the current demand level. Given that the promised lead time is 0 and actual lead times have consistently been 0, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent end-of-season demand mean and volatility. This conservative approach balances the high profit margin ($19) against the risk of leftover terminal inventory as the product exits the active season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its terminal lifecycle phase (Date: 2019/09/23). Demand in the last three periods (P30-P32) has averaged 39.3 units (40, 53, 25), which is a significant drop from the mid-summer peaks. Most importantly, Period 32 demand (25) marks a new low for the post-summer period. With only 14 periods remaining and a clear downward trend in the 'Womens Everyday Collection' trousers as autumn progresses, I am transitioning to a shorter demand window to prevent overstocking. Current on-hand is 37. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (average 39.3) and sigma_hat to reflect this lower, late-season demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season decline intensified: Period 32 demand (25) is the lowest recorded since April, confirming the SKU is in a terminal phase. P30-P32 average demand is 39.3 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664319001' (Womens Everyday Trousers) is clearly in a terminal seasonal phase as we move into October. Demand has continued its downward trend, with the P30-P33 average sitting at 37.25 units, significantly lower than the summer peak (>150 units). The most recent demand (P32: 25, P33: 31) confirms this decline. With 32 units currently on-hand and demand continuing to taper, there is a significant risk of being left with dead stock at the end of the game (Period 47). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this low-demand regime (avg ~37) and lead time remains at 0 based on consistent historical performance. The goal is to maximize profit from the remaining weeks while minimizing holding costs for units that likely won't sell as the weather cools.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a confirmed end-of-season terminal phase for woven trousers (October). Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the summer peak. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 35.2 units, a slight decrease from the previous regime but showing signs of a floor around 25-30 units. On-hand inventory is currently 31 units, which is nearly equal to the recent average weekly demand. Given the 0-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this terminal stability. Sigma_hat will also be set to the last 5 periods to capture recent volatility. This conservative approach aims to satisfy remaining demand while preventing excess terminal stock as the game approaches its end (Period 47).

Carry-over insight: Terminal demand regime stabilization: P30-P34 average demand is 35.2 units, indicating a consistent floor for the end-of-season phase compared to the P22-P25 average of 133 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its terminal end-of-season phase, with demand reaching new lows. Period 35 demand was only 15 units, significantly lower than the P30-P34 average of 35.2. As we are in mid-October, there is no expectation of recovery for this woven trouser SKU. On-hand inventory is currently 40 units, which already covers more than two weeks of current demand levels. To avoid terminal inventory and excessive holding costs, I am shifting parameters to a more conservative recent_N approach (N=3) to reflect the most recent deceleration. This will likely result in a zero or near-zero order for Period 36 as the current stock is sufficient for the immediate (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Terminal demand deceleration intensified in Period 35: demand dropped to 15 units, a 50% decrease from the P30-P34 average (35.2), signaling the final stages of the product lifecycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in its terminal lifecycle phase (end-of-season for woven trousers). Demand has significantly decelerated over the last month: Period 35 demand was 15, and Period 36 demand dropped further to 11. The current on-hand inventory is 29 units, which is already more than double the most recent weekly demand. To maximize total reward and minimize holding costs/terminal inventory risk, I am selecting parameters that will prevent additional ordering. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 3 (periods 34-36) which averages ~17.7 units per period. Since L=0, the base stock calculation will be anchored to this mean. With 29 units on hand and a declining demand trend, the OR backend's base stock policy (which includes a safety stock component) will likely result in a near-zero order, which is the desired outcome for a product exiting the market.

Carry-over insight: Terminal demand deceleration finalized: Period 36 demand dropped to 11 units, confirming a 69% decrease from the late-September average (35.2). Product is in the final clearance/exit phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its terminal end-of-season phase, with demand dropping consistently since Period 27. The current demand regime (P34-P37) shows a significant decay, falling from 31 units down to 8 units. Specifically, the last three periods (P35-P37) show demands of 15, 11, and 8, indicating that the product is exiting the market as winter approaches. Given the high stockout-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend normally targets a high service level (~95%). However, at this stage of the lifecycle, the priority is to minimize terminal inventory to avoid high cumulative holding costs on units that may never sell. Since we currently have 24 units on hand and recent demand is averaging <10 units per week, we are already overstocked for the remaining lifecycle. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit low forecast (average of the last 3 periods, ~11 units) and a lead time of 0 (confirmed consistently throughout history) to signal the OR backend to stop ordering and bleed off existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Terminal demand regime finalized: Period 37 demand dropped to 8 units, confirming a sustained decline below 15 units since Period 35. SKU is in final exit phase with high residual inventory relative to sales rate.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its terminal exit phase (November 4). Demand has remained consistently low since Period 35, ranging from 8 to 15 units. Current on-hand inventory is 9 units. Given the seasonality of woven trousers and the 'Everyday Collection' lifecycle, we are managing for minimal terminal inventory. The 'carry_over_insight' from Period 38 confirms a sustained decline below 15 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 (covering P35-P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this terminal demand floor (avg ~10 units). Lead time remains 0 based on history. This strategy ensures we do not over-order while still meeting the residual trickle of demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in its terminal exit phase with only 7 periods remaining in the game. Current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a very low level: the last 5 periods (P35-P39) show demand values of 15, 11, 8, 15, and 8, averaging 11.4 units. On-hand inventory is 10 units. Given the low demand and the proximity to the game end (Period 47), the goal is to satisfy remaining customers while minimizing terminal inventory. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this terminal floor. Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent history. The backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will likely result in a small order to cover one period of demand, maintaining lean levels.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its final terminal phase (late November). Demand has been consistently low, with the most recent observed demand at 14 units (P40) and 8 units (P39). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is approximately 11.2 units. Carry-over insights confirm the SKU is in a final exit phase. With only 7 periods remaining in the simulation (total 47), the priority is to minimize terminal inventory while meeting the residual trace demand. Current on-hand inventory is 4 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand terminal regime. Since lead time has consistently been 0, I will stay with 'default' L. These parameters will target a base stock level that covers this period's expected demand plus a small safety buffer, preventing excessive stock as the game concludes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (664319001, woven trousers) is in its terminal lifecycle phase (late November). Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average of the last 5 periods (P37-P41) being 9.6 units. Period 41 saw a further drop to 3 units. With only 6 periods remaining in the game and an current on-hand inventory of 14 units, the priority is to avoid accumulating terminal stock that will incur holding costs without being sold. The current on-hand inventory (14) already covers the recent average demand (9.6) and is more than 4x the most recent demand (3). Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the low-volume terminal regime, while the backend's base-stock calculation will likely results in zero additional orders due to the sufficient on-hand balance relative to the low demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Terminal demand floor confirmed: P37-P41 average demand is 9.6 units, representing the final exit phase for the SKU.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a sudden demand spike to 36 units, which is a significant deviation from the terminal floor average of ~9.6 units (P37-P41). This spike occurred in late November, potentially driven by Black Friday or early holiday promotions for women's trousers. However, the SKU is in its final exit phase, and we must be cautious not to over-order and risk high holding costs or terminal waste. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will adjust the mu_hat to account for this recent volatility while acknowledging the broader terminal trend. Using recent_N with N=6 (P37-P42) provides an average demand of 14 units, which balances the recent spike against the previous low-demand weeks. Lead time remains stable at 0. This approach ensures we have enough stock for potential residual holiday demand without overcommitting.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike in Period 42 (36 units) deviates from the terminal floor of ~10 units, likely due to late-November holiday sales/promotions. Monitoring to see if this is a one-off or a brief late-season lift.

=== Period 43 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $646.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in its terminal phase (Period 44 of 47). However, a significant demand spike occurred in Periods 42 (36 units) and 43 (47 units), coinciding with the late-November holiday shopping period (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). These are the highest demand figures since early September and suggests a brief late-season lift. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 0 in-transit because the lead time is 0. With only 4 periods remaining, we must satisfy this late-season surge without over-ordering and being left with terminal inventory. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this holiday spike (average ~28.7 units), while keeping sigma_hat at a recent level (N=3) to account for the increased volatility during this period. The lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Demand in P42-P43 averaged 41.5 units, a 4x increase from the November floor (~10 units), likely due to seasonal promotions.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in Period 45 (mid-December). Last period (P44) confirmed the conclusion of the late-November holiday demand spike, with demand dropping from 47 in P43 back down to 12 in P44. Current on-hand inventory is 55 units. Given the end-of-season context and the upcoming game conclusion (Period 47), the objective shifts to minimizing terminal inventory while maintaining a small buffer for residual demand. The holiday lift (P42-43) was temporary. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the pre-holiday floor and the post-holiday drop, effectively balancing the recent volatility. This N includes P42 (36), P43 (47), and P44 (12), which results in a mu_hat that still accounts for some residual holiday activity but starts the downward adjustment. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike concluded: Demand dropped from 47 (P43) to 12 (P44), confirming the transient nature of the late-November lift. Inventory management should now focus on minimizing terminal stock as the game ends in Period 47.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1178.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the penultimate period (46 of 47). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand in Period 45 spiked unexpectedly to 125 units, significantly higher than the previous 'holiday surge' average of ~42 units. This is likely a final clearance or Christmas-week surge. However, since the game concludes after Period 47, any order placed now (Period 46) with the observed lead time of 0 will arrive and be available for Period 46 demand and Period 47. Given the extreme volatility and the stockout in Period 45, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to reflect this high-demand end-of-season behavior (~100 units) to capture the final sales opportunity in Period 46 and 47 while minimizing terminal holding cost. Sigma will be set high to allow for the volatility seen in Period 45.

Carry-over insight: Final season hyper-spike: Period 45 demand reached 125 units, far exceeding the late-November holiday average (41.5 units), suggesting an aggressive pre-Christmas clearance or demand peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1664.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is the final period of the game (Period 47, Dec 30). In the previous period (P46), a high demand of 92 units was observed, following a massive spike of 125 units in P45. These appear to be late-December clearance or holiday peaks. However, effectively managing the final period requires avoiding any new orders, as any inventory un-sold by the end of this period will only incur holding costs or represent lost profit without the chance for future recovery. There are 84 units currently on-hand. Given that the game ends after this period's resolution, ordering more is detrimental. The goal is now exclusively to clear existing on-hand inventory. Lead time is set to 0 (promised), and I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect zero additional required stock beyond what is on-hand to prevent the OR backend from placing an order.

Carry-over insight: Final clearance peak confirmed: P45-P46 averaged 108.5 units, significantly higher than early December levels, likely due to end-of-year sales.
