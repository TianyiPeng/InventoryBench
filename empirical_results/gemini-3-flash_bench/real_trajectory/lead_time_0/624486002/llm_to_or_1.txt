Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for SKU 624486002 (Brit Baby Tee) shows a slight upward trend over the last 5 weeks (47, 51, 71, 68, 66), suggesting a stabilization around a mean of ~60. The product is a seasonal 'short, fitted top', which usually sees increased demand as spring approaches. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no previous arrivals to evaluate actual lead time performance, I will use the 'default' lead time of 0. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), utilizing a 'recent_N' of 3 (the most recent high-demand period) captures the current regime of ~68 units per week. With L=0, the OR backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+0) * mean(last 3 samples). Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 3 samples to reflect current volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee', a basic retail item. Demand history shows a steady trend: 47, 51, 71, 68, 66 (pre-game), and 86 in Period 1. The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 65. In Period 1, we ordered 69 units which arrived immediately (lead_time=0), but demand was 86, resulting in a stockout (69 units sold, 0 ending inventory). Predicted lead time is 0. Since the item is a basic tee and we are moving further into February, demand appears to be trending slightly higher than the initial historical average. I will use a recent_N approach to capture the move towards higher demand (averaging 66, 68, 71, and 86). I will set mu_hat to reflect an average of ~73 ((1+0)*73) and sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in the jump to 86.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee', a short, fitted top which is highly seasonally relevant for the transition into Spring (late February). Historical demand samples (Jan-early Feb) averaged 60.6 units, but recent observed demand in Period 1 (86) and Period 2 (85) shows a significant upward shift (+40%) as we enter the Spring season. In both concluded periods, the SKU stocked out (ending inventory = 0) because demand exceeded the on-hand inventory, which was set by the OR backend based on under-forecasted stats. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this rising demand phase, I am selecting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on the most recent 2 periods to capture the new demand regime (mean ~85.5) and setting L to its promised value of 0. This will increase the base stock set by the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 11 (Period 1): Average weekly demand increased from ~61 to ~85 (+39%) likely due to Spring seasonality for short-sleeve apparel.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th. The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeve t-shirt), which is entering its peak spring season. Looking at the history, the demand in Period 1 and 2 was high (86 and 85), but dropped to 56 in Period 3. However, the pre-game samples showed an upward trend (47, 51, 71, 68, 66). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 (Period 1-3 all arrived same-period). Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0 each), the OR backend will target a 50% service level (z=0). My goal is to ensure mu_hat reflects the expected demand for the upcoming week. The drop to 56 in Period 3 might be a weekly fluctuation rather than a regime shift downward, given the seasonality. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the 'post-Feb 11' regime (avging ~76 units) to avoid over-reacting to the single low data point while acknowledging the trend. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the higher volatility observed recently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-16.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeve t-shirt), which typically sees a demand increase as Spring progresses. Looking at the history, demand spiked in Periods 1-2 (86, 85) before dropping in Periods 3-4 (56, 30). This drop suggests the initial spike might have been a temporary seasonal burst or a stock-up effect. However, the pre-February baseline was lower (47-68 range). We are now in mid-March (Period 5). The 'In-transit' is 0 and on-hand is 46. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since Period 4 demand was only 30 units and ending inventory is 46, we are currently holding sufficient stock for immediate low-level demand but need to protect against the volatility observed in early February. I will use a 4-period recent average (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current high-variance environment (range 30-86) which averages ~64 units. Given Profit=Holding=$1.0, the base stock will target a 50% service level, which is appropriate for a high-holding-cost scenario relative to profit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a short-sleeve baby tee, which is seasonally relevant for spring. Historically, demand showed a peak in early February (Periods 1-2, avg ~85.5) but has moderated significantly in the last three periods (Periods 3-5, avg ~46). Specifically, demand from Periods 3-5 was 56, 30, and 52 respectively. While there was a local spike to 52 in Period 5, the overall 3-period average is 46, compared to the early-season spike of 85. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently 13 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the OR backend's service level q will be 0.5 (50%), meaning we should target the median demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower, more stable demand regime (avg 46), as the earlier surge appears to have passed or stabilized at a lower level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower level from Period 3-5: average weekly demand dropped from ~85 to ~46 (-46%) following the early February peak.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 624486002 (Brit Baby Tee) is a short-sleeved seasonal item. Period 6 (March 18) saw a significant demand surge to 128 units, far exceeding the recent average of 46 units observed in Periods 3-5. This spike likely reflects mid-to-late March spring shopping behavior. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are no units in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for the current period (Period 7). The demand history shows a high variance: 86, 85, 56, 30, 52, 128. The mean of the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is 70, but the most recent observation (128) suggests a rapid upward trend. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat (average 70) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to account for this increased volatility and volume. L remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: Demand surged from a 3-period average of 46 to 128 (+178%), signaling a second spring peak or sustained seasonal acceleration.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 624486002 (Brit Baby Tee) is exhibiting a strong upward demand trend as we enter April, which aligns with seasonal peaks for short-sleeve apparel. Period 6 demand was 128 (sold 46 due to stockout) and Period 7 demand was 138 (sold 70 due to stockout). The current inventory is 0. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period resolution. To address the repeated stockouts and the clear demand shift, I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg = 133). I will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for this recent volatility. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover this anticipated demand, helping to prevent further lost sales during this seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed Periods 6-7: average weekly demand rose to 133 units (+189% vs prior 3-period average of 46), driven by Spring seasonality for T-shirts.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brit Baby Tee' (Short-sleeve T-shirt) is experiencing a severe Spring demand surge as the calendar moves into April. Period 8 demand hit 175, significantly higher than the previous 2-period average of 133 (+31%). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has exceeded our base stock for three consecutive periods (Periods 6, 7, and 8). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this acceleration and stop the stockouts, I am adjusting mu_hat using recent_N=3. This focuses on the high-growth regime (Periods 6, 7, and 8: 128, 138, 175), yielding a mu_hat of 147 per period (x2 for 1+L estimate equals 294), but I will use explicit for mu_hat at 180 to proactively cover the upward trend and prevent further lost sales. sigma_hat will use recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility of this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Period 8 demand (175) reached a new peak, extending the high-demand regime started in Period 6. The average demand for the last 3 weeks is 147, but the trend line is steeply positive (+36% over the last two weeks).

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486002' (Brit Baby Tee) is in a high-sustained demand regime due to Spring/Summer seasonality for short-sleeve apparel. Demand over the last three weeks (Periods 7-9) has been 138, 175, and 177 respectively, averaging 163.3 units. Given the date is now April 15, we are in the peak period for this category. Although Period 9 showed a plateau (177 vs 175), the target service level (q = Profit / (Profit + HoldingCost) = 0.5) implies the backend aims for the median. However, in stock-out scenarios seen in Periods 6-8, we have been underestimating demand. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this high-demand regime (Periods 7-9) and adjust mu_hat to ensure we cover the expected demand of ~163-177 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment, but we must order aggressively to meet the high demand since ending on-hand inventory is only 3 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a high level in Period 9 (177 units), confirming a high-demand regime averaging ~163 units over the last 3 weeks (Periods 7-9).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeve t-shirt) is in a high-demand regime driven by Spring seasonality. Current period 11 (2019/4/22) follows a sustained three-week peak where demand has consistently stayed between 175 and 181 units (Periods 8-10). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 177.6 units. Despite ordering quantities close to previous forecasts, we stocked out in Period 10 (sold 164 against demand of 181) and ended with 0 inventory. The promised lead time continues to be 0 periods, confirmed by historical arrivals. To capture this stabilized high-demand plateau and prevent further stockouts during this peak seasonal window, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) which represent the current regime accurately. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 3 samples to account for the recent (though low) volatility at this high level.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a high level (175-181 units) during Periods 8-10, establishing a new high-demand regime for late Spring averaging ~178 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 624486002 (Brit Baby Tee) is currently experiencing highly volatile Spring seasonality. In Period 11, demand surged to 304 units from a previous plateau of ~180 (+70% increase). This suggests a late-April/early-May demand peak for short-sleeve tops. Total inventory is currently 0, meaning we stocked out and lost potential sales (sold only 178 of 304). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this acceleration and target the higher service level required (Profit=1.0, Holding=1.0 gives a 50% target critical ratio, but we must protect against further spikes), I am using an explicit mu_hat based on the most recent demand (304) and a calculated sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the recent 3-period regime (177, 181, 304).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Demand surged from a 3-period plateau of ~180 to 304 units (+70%), indicating a high-summer or pre-holiday peak for baby tees.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Brit Baby Tee' in Period 12 dropped to 157 units after a massive spike to 304 in Period 11. This suggests that the Period 11 value was a localized peak (potentially a pre-summer promotion or specific event) rather than a sustained shift to a 300+ unit regime. Looking at the history (Periods 8-10), demand consistently averaged around 178 units. The drop to 157 in Period 12 reinforces that the previous high-demand regime of ~160-180 units is likely still the baseline. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 8-12) to capture this high-spring/early-summer level while accounting for the recent volatility. This averages to approximately 199 units per period including the spike. L is set to 'default' as lead time has consistently been 0 periods. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' for 5 periods to capture the increased variance caused by the recent demand swing.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: The 304 unit spike in Period 11 was transient; Period 12 demand returned to 157 units, closer to the Period 8-10 average of ~178 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand dropped significantly to 78 units, following a trend of stabilization after the transient peak of 304 units in Period 11 and 157 units in Period 12. This suggests a new, lower demand regime as we move further into May, likely transitioning away from the late-Spring peak. The current on-hand inventory is 121 units. Given that the 'Brit Baby Tee' is a seasonal item and demand has dropped by ~50% in each of the last two periods (304 -> 157 -> 78), I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent lower demand average. Using N=2 for mu_hat specifically targets this sharp downturn (average of 157 and 78 is ~117.5) to avoid excessive overstocking, while keeping sigma_hat at N=3 to account for the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Demand dropped to 78 units, confirming a sharp downward trend from the Period 11 peak (304) and Period 12 (157), suggesting a transition to a lower-demand seasonal phase.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486002' (Brit Baby Tee) is currently experiencing a significant post-peak decline as we move towards late May. Demand peaked at 304 in Period 11 and has since dropped to 157, 78, and most recently 107 in Period 14. This indicates a volatile transition out of the high-spring/early-summer peak. In Period 14, the 'ordered=0' decision combined with an ending inventory of 14 units suggests the system is clearing stock. Given the recent demand values (78, 107) and the downward trend from the previous regime (average ~180), I will target a more conservative demand forecast. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (average ~114) to better reflect this lower-demand phase while maintaining enough safety stock (sigma_hat recent_N=3) to cover potential late-spring demand spikes. Lead time L=0 is consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Following the Period 11 peak (304), demand has entered a lower, more volatile phase averaging ~114 units over Periods 12-14, significantly down from the previous ~180 unit plateau.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift from the late-April peak of 304 units into a more stable but lower late-spring phase. Over the last four periods (Periods 12-15), demand has been 157, 78, 107, and 129 units, respectively. This averages to approximately 118 units. Period 15 showed a slight increase to 129, suggesting demand is stabilizing within the 110-130 range rather than continuing to fall. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the backend OR logic will target the 50th percentile (median) for the base stock level. I will use the recent_N method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak regime (averaging 118 units per period). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with no missed or delayed shipments observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at Periods 12-15: Following the Period 11 peak (304), demand has stabilized into a lower regime averaging 118 units (+/- 25%).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16 (2019/5/27), demand spiked to 211 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 4-period average of ~118 units. This indicates that the 'stabilization' noted in the Period 16 carry-over insight was premature, and we are seeing a new upward volatility or a late spring/early summer demand surge for the baby tee product category. With current on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit at 0, I need to set parameters that respond to this recent surge while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat). I will use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent regime shift (Periods 12-16) which includes the 304 and 211 peaks as well as the 78 and 107 lows, providing a balanced but responsive forecast for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=5 to accurately reflect the current high variance in demand. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Demand surged to 211 units (+79% vs previous 4-period average of 118), indicating a return to high-volatility summer demand patterns.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 624486002 (Brit Baby Tee) is currently experiencing high summer demand. Over the last two weeks (Periods 16 and 17), demand has surged to 211 and 176 respectively, significantly higher than the previous 4-period average of 118. The current date is June 10, which matches peak seasonal demand for short-sleeved jersey tops. We are currently stocked out (Ending Inventory 0) and missing sales. Observed lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 2 periods of high demand (average 193.5) to ensure we capture this summer peak, as previous 'recent_N' averages were too conservative and led to stockouts. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility seen since the Period 11 spike.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand surge confirmed: Periods 16-17 average demand is 193.5 units, a 64% increase over the mid-May average of 118, reflecting peak seasonality for baby tees.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 624486002 (Brit Baby Tee) is currently in its peak Summer season (mid-June). Historical data shows a significantly higher demand regime since Period 16, with demand values of 211, 176, and 137. The average of the last three periods (Periods 16-18) is approximately 175 units. Although Period 18 saw a slight dip to 137, current seasonality suggests maintaining a higher base stock to avoid stockouts, as seen in Period 16 and 17 where demand exceeded starting on-hand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach with N=3 to capture the current high-demand summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, balancing the recent high sales with the Period 18 dip.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, which is peak summer. The product is a short-sleeved 'Brit Baby Tee', which exhibits strong summer seasonality. Recent demand history shows a high-volume regime starting from Period 16 (late May). Over the last four periods (Periods 16-19), demand has been 211, 176, 137, and 160, averaging approximately 171 units per week. Although demand dropped from the Period 16 peak, it remains consistently high compared to the mid-May averages (~118). Period 18 saw demand at 137, followed by an increase to 160 in Period 19, suggesting a stabilization in this high-demand summer bracket. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this summer regime (avg ~171) for mu_hat. Given the volatility in this period (standard deviation is roughly 31), I will also use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock against summer demand spikes. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization confirmed Periods 16-19: Late May to June demand for short-sleeved baby tees is averaging ~171 units per week, significantly higher than the mid-May plateau of 118.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved ribbed t-shirt), which is in peak summer seasonality. Demand history shows a steady high-demand regime from mid-June (Periods 17-20), with sales and demand consistently between 137 and 211 units. The average demand over the last four periods (Periods 17-20: 176, 137, 160, 170) is 160.75 units. I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent summer plateau while smoothing out the minor fluctuations. The lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the game history. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 4 periods to reflect recent volatility. With on-hand inventory at 1 and in-transit at 0, the backend will place an order roughly equal to the base-stock target (minus the 1 unit). Setting L to default (0) aligns with the observed lead time history.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486002' (Brit Baby Tee) is in its peak summer season (July 8). Analysis of recent history (Periods 16-21) shows a sustained high-demand regime with demand samples of 211, 176, 137, 160, 170, and 187. The average demand over these last 6 periods is approximately 173.5 units. Period 21 demand (187) suggests a slight upward trend or continued peak strength. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period). To capture this stabilized summer regime and ensure high service levels (critical since profit = holding cost, making the target service level 50% but needing to cover the high demand variance), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current high-demand summer phase while accounting for the significant weekly volatility (range of 137 to 211).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime confirmed (Periods 16-21): Average weekly demand for baby tees is ~174 units with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 25), reflecting peak seasonal demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product (Brit Baby Tee) is a seasonal summer item. Historical data shows a sustained summer peak regime starting around Period 16 (late May), with an average demand of approximately 174 units. However, the last recorded demand (Period 22) was lower at 124 units. This might indicate the start of a late-summer slowdown, but given the volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 25) and the peak seasonality of July for short-sleeve tops, it is safer to maintain a forecast near the established summer average. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (covering the summer regime from Period 16 to 22) to capture the current level while acknowledging the recent dip. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved baby tee, a seasonal summer item. Analyzing the demand history from Period 16 to Period 23, the product has maintained a high-summer demand regime averaging approximately 163 units per week (211, 176, 137, 160, 170, 187, 124, 136). While there has been a slight cooling in the last two periods (124 and 136), demand remains significantly higher than the mid-May valley (~118). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50% (the median). To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs for this high-volume period, I will use a recent window (N=8) to capture the summer regime while reflecting the recent slight stabilization/dip. Setting lead time to 'calculate' to continue leveraging the proven 0-day lead time.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 624486002 (Brit Baby Tee) is currently in a stable but slightly declining summer demand phase. Over the last three periods (P22-P24), demand has been 124, 136, and 129, resulting in a three-period average of 129.7 units. This represents a significant step down from the June peak average of ~174 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To optimize for the current regime and avoid overstocking as the peak summer season begins to wind down towards August, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on this recent stabilization at ~130 units. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that covers the current demand level while accounting for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Demand has moved from the summer peak (~174 units) to a late-summer plateau averaging ~130 units over the last three periods (P22-P24), a decrease of 25%.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 624486002 is currently in a late-summer phase where demand has cooled from its July peak (~174 units) to a stable plateau averaging ~126 units over the last 4 periods (P22-P25: 124, 136, 129, 113). The latest demand observation of 113 units confirms this downward shift. As we are entering August (moving away from the primary spring/summer peaks for baby tees), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect this lower-demand regime. The actual lead time remains consistent with the promised lead time of 0 periods, as evidenced by every order in the history arriving within the same period (L=0). Using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation ensures the OR backend captures both the lower volume and the reduced volatility observed in the current period cluster.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed for late-summer (P22-P25): Average weekly demand for baby tees has plateaued at ~126 units, down 28% from the summer peak (~174 units).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Brit Baby Tee has entered a clear downward trend moving into mid-August, consistent with the end of the summer season for short-sleeved tops. Period 26 demand (77 units) is the lowest observed since May (Period 13), significantly below the late-summer plateau average of ~126 units identified in the carry-over insights. This suggests a new demand regime shift starting at Period 26. To capture this decline while remaining responsive to potential late-summer volatility, I will use a short window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps prevent overstocking as the seasonal demand fades. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Demand dropped to 77 units, a 39% decrease from the previous 4-period average of 126, marking the transition out of the summer peak into a lower late-season regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Brit Baby Tee is currently in a downward seasonal transition as summer ends. In Period 26 (Aug 5), demand dropped to 77 units, and in Period 27 (Aug 12), it remained low at 73 units. This confirms a significant shift from the late-summer plateau of ~126 units to a new lower-demand regime. Given this clear exit from the peak season, I will use a 3-period window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to prioritize the most recent data (77, 73, and the preceding 113) while moving away from the higher summer volumes. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustments. The backend will use these parameters to scale inventory down, avoiding excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $1 profit/holding cost ratio (equating to a 50% target critical ratio before safety stock adjustments).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28: Demand has stabilized at a lower level for late August, averaging ~75 units over the last 2 periods (P26-P27), down from the late-summer plateau of ~126 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 624486002 (Brit Baby Tee) is currently in a late-August seasonal transition. Demand has consistently decelerated from the summer peak (~174) to a late-summer plateau (~126), and finally to a lower regime observed over the last three periods (P26-P28), where demand averaged 77.33 units (77, 73, and 82). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this stabilized lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent three periods of the current trend. This ensures we don't over-order based on higher historical summer volumes while maintaining sufficient stock for the current localized demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed for late August (Periods 26-28): Average weekly demand has plateaued at ~77 units, representing a 39% decrease from the late-summer plateau (~126).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Demand for the Brit Baby Tee (a short-sleeved garment) has shown a clear seasonal decline as we move out of summer. The most recent demand stabilization was confirmed in Period 29, covering Periods 26-28 with an average of ~77 units. Period 29 demand (60 units) suggests a continued gentle downward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this late-season phase while maintaining a high service level (since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, but the backend uses stock-out protection logic), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (P26-P29: 77, 73, 82, 60), which averages ~73 units. This reflects the current lower-demand regime while allowing for some variability. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this 4-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Average weekly demand for baby tees continues to decline in late August/early September, with Period 29 showing 60 units, bringing the late-season average to ~73 units (Periods 26-29).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Brit Baby Tee has entered a consistent decline as summer ends and we move into September. The average demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) is 62 units (73, 82, 60, 33), with a notable drop to 33 in the most recent period. This confirms the seasonal transition observed in carry-over insights for late August and early September. Given the 100% service level requirement (Profit=Holding=$1.0), the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the next period plus a safety buffer. Setting N=5 for mu_hat captures this recent downward stabilization accurately (averaging ~64 units per period), while default sigma_hat accounts for the inherent volatility in this seasonal transition phase. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Late-season decline intensified in early September, with demand dropping to 33 units. Average demand for the last 4 periods (P27-P30) has fallen to 62 units, down 15% from the previous late-August plateau of ~73.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486002' (Brit Baby Tee) is entering a late-season/fall demand trough as expected for summer apparel in mid-September. Demand has dropped significantly over the last three weeks: from 60 to 33 and finally to 18 units in Period 31. This confirms a sustained downward shift. I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture this declining regime (averages P28-P31: 82, 60, 33, 18), resulting in a more responsive mean of 48.25 units. The promised lead time of 0 consistently matches the actual lead time observed in history, so I am maintaining L=0. With on-hand inventory at 47 units, almost matching the new forecasted need, the backend's capped policy will minimize further ordering to avoid overstocking and holding costs during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 32: Demand has entered a late-season trough, falling to 18 units. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P29-P31) is 37 units, a 40% decrease from the previous 4-period average of 62.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Brit Baby Tee continues its late-season decline as we move further into September. The last three periods (P30-P32) recorded demand values of 33, 18, and 16 units respectively, confirming a low-demand regime for late-summer/early-fall apparel. The current on-hand inventory is 33 units, which already covers the most recent demand observation twice over. Given the steady downward trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent trough (average demand of ~22 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The goal is to minimize holding costs while maintaining a slim buffer for the remaining low-level demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at a late-season trough (Periods 30-32): Average weekly demand has dropped to ~22 units, a 40% decrease from the previous 3-period average of 37 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486002' (Brit Baby Tee) is currently in a late-season/fall trough. Demand has stabilized at a very low level compared to the summer peak. The latest demand in Period 33 was 29 units, while the previous three periods (P30-P32) averaged 22 units. Given the transition into late September (Period 34), demand is expected to remain low but slightly higher than the deep trough of mid-September (16-18 units). The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently very low (4 units). I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (P30-P33) to capture this low-demand regime, which averages ~24 units. This will signal the OR backend to place a small order to cover current demand while minimizing holding costs in a period of low seasonal relevance.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at late-season trough (Periods 30-33): Average weekly demand for baby tees is ~24 units, consistent with the end of the summer season.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brit Baby Tee' is in a late-season trough as we enter October. Recent demand from Periods 30-34 has been 33, 18, 16, 29, and 20 units, respectively, yielding a 5-period average of approximately 23.2 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. With on-hand inventory at 4 units and no units in transit, we need to order to meet the expected demand for Period 35. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime, ensuring we don't over-order as the product moves out of its primary summer season.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019, which is in the mid-autumn period for the Brit Baby Tee (a short-sleeve jersey top). Demand has stabilized at a late-season trough. Over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has been 18, 16, 29, 20, and 15, yielding an average of approximately 19.6 units per week. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in the history. To prevent overstocking during this low-demand phase and to minimize holding costs (which are equal to the profit per unit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime. This keeps a tight 1-period coverage (L=0 means we need to cover demand for current period) while accounting for recent volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 5.6).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486002' (Brit Baby Tee) is currently in a stable low-demand regime typical for late autumn (October). Demand has consistently trended downward from the summer peaks, stabilizing at a very low level. Over the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has been 20, 15, and 12 units respectively, averaging 15.6 units. This confirms the 'late-season trough' described in carry-over insights. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level for these residual sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 4 (covering P33-P36) to capture this most recent stabilization at the ~15-20 unit level. On-hand inventory is currently 8 units, which is roughly 50% of the weekly average, so the OR backend should trigger a small replenishment to meet the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at late-season trough confirmed through mid-October (P34-P36): Average weekly demand has further declined to ~16 units, down from the ~24 unit average observed in September.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Brit Baby Tee has entered a stable late-season trough as of mid-October (P34-P37), with weekly demand averaging 15.5 units (20, 15, 12, 15). This aligns with the seasonal nature of short-sleeved jerseys in late autumn. Since Period 34, demand has shown very low volatility and a significant reduction from previous summer peaks. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this stabilized low-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), ensuring the OR engine maintains minimal but sufficient stock (base stock) to cover this trough without over-ordering and incurring holding costs, which equal profit ($1/unit) and thus require a balanced service level.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486002' (Brit Baby Tee) is a seasonal short-sleeve item. Demand has consistently declined from its summer peak (~174) and subsequent late-summer plateau (~126) to a late-season trough. For the last 3 periods (P36-P38), demand has been 12, 15, and 7 respectively, averaging ~11.3 units. This reflects the transition into winter (November), where demand for lightweight baby tees is minimal. The current on-hand inventory is 9 units. Given the low demand and 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (suggesting a 50% service level target), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent late-autumn regime (P35-P38: 15, 12, 15, 7, average 12.25). Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. These parameters will maintain a lean inventory to avoid high holding costs during the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at late-season trough (Periods 35-38): Average weekly demand for baby tees has further declined to ~12 units, down from the ~16 unit average observed in mid-October.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486002' (Brit Baby Tee) is currently in a late-season/winter trough. The current date is 2019-11-11. Demand has been consistently low for the past several periods: P35 (15), P36 (12), P37 (15), P38 (7), and P39 (17). The average demand over these last 5 periods (recent_N=5) is 13.2 units per week. Although demand ticked up slightly to 17 in P39, causing a stockout (sold 13, on-hand 0), the overall trend remains at a low-demand baseline characteristic of off-season baby tees. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To handle the current stockout and maintain service level for this low-demand regime, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand behavior (approx 13 units/week) while ignoring the high-volume summer data.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a low off-season level (approx 13 units/week) throughout October and early November (P35-P39).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Brit Baby Tee' (a summer-seasonal SKU) has been in a sustained off-season trough since October, stabilizing at approximately 13 units per week during Periods 35-40. Recent demand (P39: 17, P40: 14) confirms this plateau. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain a lean inventory while ensuring a high service level for this low-demand phase, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean and volatility (approx 13 units/week and minimal variance). This prevents over-ordering during the off-season. L remains set to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period lead time history.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved baby tee, which is in its off-season phase. Historical demand for the last 7 periods (P35-P41) has been consistently low: 15, 12, 15, 7, 17, 14, 7 (average ~12.4). The most recent period (P41) saw demand of 7. There are no significant upcoming holidays that typically drive demand for this specific category (short-sleeved cotton jersey) in late November. The game history consistently shows a lead time of 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is 6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this stable, low-demand off-season regime while maintaining slightly higher sensitivity to potential minor fluctuations than the 'default' would allow. Predicted base stock will be roughly mean + 1.64 sigma, which aligns with minimizing holding costs for this low-turnover period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the Brit Baby Tee is in its off-season trough. Demand has remained consistently low and range-bound throughout November, with the last 5 periods (P38-P42) recording demands of 7, 17, 14, 7, and 19 units, yielding a mean of 12.8. Although we are entering the December holiday season, this product's profile as a short-sleeved spring/summer staple makes a significant holiday surge unlikely compared to winter apparel. The actual lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with no evidence of delays or losses. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current off-season baseline and use L=default (0 periods) to ensure stock levels cover incoming demand immediately.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at off-season levels (avg ~13 units) through late November (P38-P42).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. Historical demand for the Brit Baby Tee (a short-sleeved garment) remains in a stable off-season trough. Analysis of the recent regime (Periods 35-43) shows a consistent average weekly demand of approximately 13 units. The most recent demand (Period 43) was 9 units, following a peak of 19 units in Period 42, which remains within the observed volatility of the current regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods since the start of the game. On-hand inventory is 4 units with no units in transit. Given the stability of the off-season demand (\u03bc \u2248 13) and the consistent lead time, I will use a recent window (N=9, covering Periods 35-43) to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This ensures the inventory levels are calibrated to current demand rather than earlier seasonal peaks, minimizing holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the low-volume period.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand for the 'Brit Baby Tee' has been extremely stable at off-season levels throughout October, November, and early December, with the last 7 periods (P38-P44) averaging 11.4 units. Although we are approaching the holiday season (mid-December), this specific item (a short-sleeved baby tee) is a summer-seasonal basic, and the historical data through November shows no evidence of a winter holiday spike, remaining anchored around 10-15 units/week. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 7 to capture the sustained off-season stability while filtering out any older higher-demand data. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to reflect the low volatility currently observed (std \u2248 4.7). The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, so the backend will aim to carry approximately the mean demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019 (Period 46). The product is a short-sleeved baby tee, which is currently in its off-season trough. Demand has been extremely low and stable for several months, averaging approximately 12 units per week over the last 10 periods (P36-P45). With the game ending at Period 47, we are in the penultimate decision phase. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the low off-season demand and the equal cost profile (Profit=$1, Holding=$1), the objective is to maintain minimal inventory to avoid holding costs while covering the expected minimal demand for the remaining two periods. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current stable off-season regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30 (Period 47). This is mid-winter, which is the off-season for the 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved apparel). Historical demand over the last 10 periods (since Period 37) has been consistently low, averaging approximately 13 units per week (min 7, max 19) with no significant trend. The most recent demand in Period 46 was 18 units, which led to a stockout (on-hand is 0). Since the product is a staple basic tee, demand is expected to remain at this low off-season plateau until early spring. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will continue to use a recent window (N=10) to reflect this stable off-season demand and maintain high service levels while minimizing holding costs for this low-volume period.
