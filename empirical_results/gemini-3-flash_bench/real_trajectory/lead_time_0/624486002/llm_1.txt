The average over the last 5 weeks is approx 63 units/week. c) Lead time is promised at 0 periods, meaning an order placed now arrives in time to satisfy Period 1 demand. d) Starting inventory is 0. e) Given the rising trend and the nature of the product, I expect demand for the week of 2019-02-11 to be around 65-70 units. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, targeting the median demand. I will order 70 units to cover Period 1 demand and establish a baseline inventory.",

The date is mid-February (late winter moving toward spring), which is a time when retailers begin seeing increased demand for spring basics/layering pieces. Looking at historical data, demand grew from ~47-51 in early Jan to 66-71 in late Jan/early Feb. In Period 1 (2019-02-11), the actual demand was 86, which is significantly higher than the training average of ~63. This confirms an upward trend likely driven by spring seasonality and the item being a basic staple. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 (order placed in P1 arrived in P1). In Period 1, I ordered 70 but demand was 86, resulting in a stockout (lost 16 sales). I need to cover Period 2 demand (likely ~85-95 units based on the trend) plus replenish the safety stock. Given Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is technically 50%, but because lead time is 0, getting stock in immediately to meet the current period is low-risk as long as I don't significantly overbuy. I will target a stock level of 100 units to meet the current demand and capture the upward momentum without excessive holding cost risk.",

Recent game history shows a significant jump to 86 and 85 in Periods 1 and 2, suggesting a new higher demand regime or seasonal ramp-up. Current Period 3 date is Feb 25th. We are entering March, which likely sustains or increases this demand for spring apparel. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to cover Period 3 demand (occurring after this decision) and potentially buffer for Period 4. Given the recent demand of ~85 units and the 15 units on-hand, I need to order enough to meet at least 85-90 units today.

(b) Demand regime analysis: Initial historical data (Jan-early Feb) was ~60 units. We saw a spike in P1/P2 (86, 85), but P3 and P4 showed a significant decline (56, 30). The 'carry_over_insight' regarding a shift to ~85 units appears to have been a short-term peak or anomaly rather than a sustained regime, as P4 demand dropped to just 30 units. (c) Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods via P1-P4 conclude messages. (d) Current inventory: 55 units on-hand. (e) Decision logic: Given the sharp decline in demand over the last two weeks (56 down to 30), I must be cautious to avoid high holding costs ($1/unit). However, the product is a seasonal spring item. I will forecast demand for P5 at approximately 40 units (splitting the difference between recent low and historical average). Since lead time is 0, the order arrives instantly. To cover P5 demand and enter P6 with a small safety buffer (approx 15 units), I target a total available stock of 55 units.

This spike was unanticipated (inventory was stocked for ~70 units), resulting in stockouts and lost sales. Historical demand in early 2019 was in the 40-70 range, but the recent jump to 128 indicates we have entered a higher-demand spring season regime.
