The most recent demand (2019-02-04) was 55. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive in time to meet Period 1 demand. d) Inventory/Pipeline: On-hand and In-transit are both 0. e) Order Logic: Since the product arrives in the same period (L=0), I need to order enough to cover Period 1's demand.

Since on-hand inventory is 19 and expected demand is ~45, I need to order enough to cover Period 2 demand and leave a small buffer.

The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals in P1 and P2 confirm actual lead time is indeed 0 (same-period arrival). Current on-hand is 0.

The drop to 50 in Period 4 suggests the peak of the early spring transition may be stabilizing, or it could be natural variance. Given the promised lead time of 0 has been consistently met (all orders P1-P4 arrived same-period), I will treat the lead time as 0. We currently have 60 units on hand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a basic t-shirt which saw a significant late-December spike to 40 units in Period 46, likely driven by holiday shopping/gift-giving or post-Christmas sales. For the current decision (Period 47, Dec 30), I anticipate demand will remain elevated compared to the late-autumn trough (~15 units) but may begin to taper off as the New Year begins. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I can react quickly to demand. I currently have 0 on-hand inventory. My goal is to cover the expected demand for the upcoming period while minimizing holding costs on potential overstock. Based on the recent jump from 29 to 40, I will forecast Period 47 demand at approximately 35-40 units. I will order 40 units to ensure no lost sales during this end-of-year window.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand lift confirmed: Late December demand (P45-P46) averaged 34.5 units, more than double the November trough of 14.75 units (+134%).",
