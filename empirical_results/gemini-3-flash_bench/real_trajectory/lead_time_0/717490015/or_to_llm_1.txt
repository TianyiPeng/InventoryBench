Historical demand samples from January to early February show a mean of 44 units (54, 36, 43, 32, 55). While February usually marks the beginning of spring fashion interest, the current demand is relatively stable. The OR recommendation suggests ordering 53 units based on a base-stock policy with a promised lead time of 0 periods. Since the lead time is 0 (arrives same period as decision), and we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to order enough to cover the immediate demand of the current period. The OR's 53 units align with the higher end of the historical range (max 55), providing a small safety buffer against stockouts without incurring excessive holding costs ($1/unit).

Inventory & Pipeline: Currently 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. \n4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 60 units. This is likely conservative because it benchmarks against the historical mean (approx 44 units) and applies a cap. \n5. Adjustment: Given the stockout in P2 (lost demand of at least 21 units), the current demand is likely trending higher than the Jan mean.

Inventory: Current on-hand is 0. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 67 is based on the older historical mean (~44) and the newer spikes, but it's likely under-forecasting because it treats all historical data equally.

Demand Analysis: Historical samples (Jan) averaged ~42. Recent actual demand (Periods 1-4) has been 41, 73, 82, and 50 (Avg: 61.5). The surge in periods 2 and 3 aligns with the product being a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' and the transition into spring/warmer weather. Period 4 saw a slight dip to 50, but the overall recent average remains higher than the initial history. 3. Inventory & OR Review: Current on-hand is 35. The OR recommendation of 31 units targets a base stock level based on the full historical sample set (which is skewed low by January's data). Given the seasonal uplift, I estimate next period's demand between 55-75 units. 4. Final Strategy: To cover P5 demand (approx 65 units) and maintain a small buffer, I need roughly 75-80 units available. With 35 on-hand, an order of 40-45 units is more robust than the OR's 31.

This confirms a significant shift to a higher mean (avg ~59.2), likely driven by the seasonal relevance of the product (Cat Tee/Jersey Basic) as spring approaches (March). While demand spiked in P2 and P3, it stabilized at 50 in P4 and P5.\n3. Inventory & OR Review: Starting inventory is 30. There is no in-transit. The OR recommends 35 units. Applying a base-stock logic with the recent mean (~60) and L=0, the target should be enough to cover the current period's demand plus a small buffer. If I order 35 units, I have 65 total available units to meet Period 6 demand.\n4. Adjustment: The target of 65 is reasonable if demand stays at 50, but slightly low if it reverts to the 70-80 range seen earlier in the month.

Historical demand in the most recent five periods (P5-P9) has averaged 68.4 units/period, compared to the early periods (P1-P4) which averaged 61.5. A 'Carry-over insight' from Period 4 noted a shift to ~77 units, and while the very latest weeks (P8, P9) showed a slight dip to 68 and 57, mid-April (P10) is a peak time for basic spring apparel. 3. Inventory & OR Alignment: Current on-hand inventory is 38 units. The OR baseline recommends 35 units (Targeting ~73 units total). Given that we frequently sell out when demand spikes above 80 (as seen in P3, P6, P7), and the zero lead time allows for responsive ordering, the OR recommendation is slightly conservative but reasonable.

Historical demand analysis shows a significant mid-summer peak (July) where demand averaged ~160 units, followed by a clear decline in August as the 'back-to-school' transition begins. The last three periods (P25-P27) show demand stabilizing at 80, 82, and 72 units respectively, confirming the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 26 that the peak has ended. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistently observed in the history. The OR baseline recommends 72 units based on historical averages (\u03bc = 80.9, \u03c3 = 35.8). Given that current on-hand inventory is 31 units and the most recent demand was 72, an order of 72 units (OR recommendation) would bring the total available inventory for Period 28 to 103 units. This provides a safe buffer (approx. 1.4x the recent demand) to cover potential volatility while the regime stabilizes at a lower level for late summer/early autumn, avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit).",
