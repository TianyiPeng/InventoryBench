Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 692226003 is a 'Fitted strappy top', a jersey basic item. Historical demand from the last 5 weeks shows a mean of 108.2 and a standard deviation of 33.5. Demand has been generally increasing (90, 75, 152, 112, 142). The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no historical lead time arrivals yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent upward trend and variation while ignoring the lack of earlier data. Current on-hand is 0, so an immediate order is necessary to meet demand for the current period, especially since the lead time is 0. Projected demand for the lead+review period (1+0=1 period) is roughly 108 units.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a basic jersey tank top. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) show values: 90, 75, 152, 112, 142 (Mean: 114.2, Std: 31.8). Period 1 actual demand was 138, which is slightly above the long-term mean but aligns with the upward trend seen in early February (moving from Jan low of 75 to Feb high of 142). The actual lead time for Period 1 was 0, matching the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 31 units. Given the seasonality of a 'Fitted strappy top' moving into spring (February/March), I expect demand to remain at the level of the most recent month. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the February demand levels (112, 142, and the actual Period 1 demand of 138) to set mu_hat, ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the current trend while maintaining a safe service level for this high-profit-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Jersey Basic' fitted strappy top, classified as a 'Divided Basic.' We are entering the end of February (2019/2/25), heading into the Spring/Summer season where demand for tank tops typically increases. Historical demand shows a general upward trend: Jan (75-152, mean ~107) compared to Feb so far (142, 138, 180, mean ~153). In Period 2, we experienced a stockout (demand 180, sold 165), indicating current inventory levels are insufficient. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the more recent elevated demand (Jan 21, Jan 28, Feb 4, Feb 11, Feb 18) which averages ~144 units per period. Since L=0, mu_hat needs to cover the current period's demand (1+0 periods). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility and ensure a buffer against further demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~107 in January to ~153 in February (+43%), likely driven by early Spring seasonality for basics.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is a basic jersey top entering March (Period 4). History shows a clear upward demand trend: January averaged ~107 units, while February (Periods 1-3) averaged 166 units (138, 180, 180). This confirms the demand regime shift previously noted. We are entering the Spring season where demand for 'Jersey Basics' and 'Fitted strappy tops' typically accelerates. Last two periods saw a solid demand of 180 units, leading to stockouts or near-stockouts (ending inventory of 0 and 6). Current on-hand is only 6 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on the last 3 'conclude' messages. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand February/March regime (average ~166) rather than the lower January levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: February average demand reached 166 units, a significant step up from January's 107. March is expected to maintain or exceed this level due to Spring seasonality for basic apparel.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3854.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Anita Tank' is a basic jersey top, which is experiencing clear seasonal growth as we enter March (Spring). Historical demand from the provided samples (Jan) averaged ~107. Since game start (Feb), demand has consistently increased: P1=138, P2=180, P3=180, P4=203. The current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given the upward trend and the transition into mid-March, I expect demand to remain high or continue growing. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg = 187.6) and set mu_hat explicitly slightly higher (210) to account for the clear 200+ breakout in P4 and prevent stockouts. sigma_hat will be based on the recent volatility (N=4) to ensure the safety stock covers the current trend variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: March demand has broken 200 units (P4: 203), following a high February average of 166. Total growth from January base (~107) is now ~90%.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a basic tank top, which generally sees increased demand in Spring. Reviewing the demand history: P1=138, P2=180, P3=180, P4=203, P5=137. The average across these five periods is ~167.6 units. While P4 saw a peak of 203, P5 dropped to 137, likely due to a post-peak correction rather than a regime collapse. The pre-game January average was ~108. The current regime (since P1) averages ~168. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, my priority is ensuring on-hand stock covers current demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher volatility and mean established since February (P1-P5). This sets mu_hat at approximately (1+0)*168 = 168. With profit=$19 and holding=$1, the target service level q is 0.95, which the OR engine will use to generate a safety stock based on the recent standard deviation.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a 'Divided Basics' tank top, which is highly sensitive to Spring seasonality. Reviewing historical data: January mean was ~107. February mean was 166. March demand so far (P4-P6) has been 203, 137, and 167 (average 169). While P5 demand (137) was lower, the overall trend since mid-February remains significantly higher than the baseline. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 49 units on-hand. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the elevated Spring regime (averaging 173 units over the last 5 weeks). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen as volume grew. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accommodates the ~170 unit weekly demand peak while providing a safety buffer for the variability observed in March.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime plateau: March demand is averaging ~169 units, statistically similar to February's 166, suggesting the rapid growth phase seen between Jan and Feb has stabilized at a new, higher baseline for the Spring season.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (Anita Tank) is entering the core Spring/Summer season. Historical observations for March (Periods 4-7) show demand samples of 203, 137, 167, and 140, averaging 161.75 units. This supports the 'Spring plateau' noted in carry-over insights. Total pipeline (on-hand 74 + in-transit 0) is low relative to this demand level. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed in Period 7 conclude). For Period 8, I will maintain mu_hat based on the recent Spring regime (last 4 periods of March) to account for the stabilization at this higher level. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (4) to capture the higher volatility seen in recent weeks (ranging from 137 to 203) compared to the low-variance January starts. L remains default (0).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Jersey Basic' tank top, currently entering early April (Spring). History shows that demand has been highly volatile but generally elevated since February. Period 8 saw a significant demand surge to 215 units, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). The last 3 periods (P6-P8) have averaged ~174 units, which is consistent with the 'Spring plateau' noted in insights, but the volatility remains high (CV ~0.2). Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand spring phase, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (P4-P8), which averages ~172.4 (total mu_hat = (1+0)*172.4 = 172.4). I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (last 5 samples) to capture the recent high volatility (stdev ~36), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic vest top, showing strong seasonal growth as we enter the Spring/Summer peak. Since Period 3 (late February), we have observed a higher demand regime. Current date is mid-April (2019/4/15). The last four weeks (Periods 6-9) have shown significant volatility but a high average demand (167, 140, 215, 131 = average 163.25). Historically, February averaged ~166 and March averaged ~169. April is continuing this high-plateau trend but with increased variance. I will set N=7 for mu_hat to capture the stability of the high-demand regime since late February (avoiding the lower January data) while smoothing out the recent weekly volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), so I will maintain L=0. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current high volatility in sales.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is a jersey basic, highly relevant as we move into late April and May (Spring/Summer transition). Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the 'Spring plateau' identified in Period 7, demand has fluctuated between 131 and 215 units. Over the last 10 periods (since the game start in February), the mean demand is approximately 165 units. However, looking at the most recent 4 periods (Periods 7-10), the mean is 160.25, while the Period 8 spike (215) suggests high volatility still exists. Given the date is April 22nd, we are entering the peak season for tank tops. I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture the full Spring regime while smoothing out the high week-to-week volatility (std dev is significant). This provides a robust base stock that accounts for both the 150-170 baseline and the potential for 200+ spikes as temperatures rise.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is a jersey basic, which is highly seasonal towards late Spring and Summer. Current observation date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand from February to April shows a consistent high-demand plateau. Mean demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 164 units (Total 1800 / 11). Over the most recent 4 periods (P8-P11), mean demand is 163.75 (215, 131, 155, 154). Despite variations (P8 spike), the demand has stabilized around ~165. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival) across all history. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this stable Spring plateau for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, as this period represents the stabilized demand mentioned in Carry-over Insights (Period 7). The OR backend will calculate the base stock using these parameters to meet the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Anita Tank' (Jersey Basic fitted strappy top), which is a spring/summer staple. Historically, demand rose significantly from January (~107) to February/March/April. The last 5 periods (P8-P12) show a mean demand of 168.2 (215, 131, 155, 154, 186). As we move into May (Period 13), demand is expected to remain high or increase further as warmer weather settles in. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is low (37 units on hand), requiring an order that captures the current high-demand regime. Using N=5 for the most recent representative period of the spring plateau provides a stable yet responsive forecast for both mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Late Spring demand plateau confirmed: April/Early May demand is averaging ~168 units, consistent with the shift established in late February and March.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is a jersey basic garment. We are now in Period 14 (mid-May). Historical demand from Period 5 through Period 13 shows a stable late-Spring regime with a mean demand of approximately 167 units (samples: 137, 167, 140, 215, 131, 155, 154, 186, 189). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all concluded cycles. Given the current date of May 13th, demand for tank tops is expected to remain firm or slightly increase as summer approaches. To capture this stabilized regime and recent volatility, I will use a recent_N approach (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the period from roughly mid-March to early May. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~167) and the observed standard deviation while maintaining a high service level appropriate for a high-profit (19:1) item.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is a basic jersey top, a quintessential late Spring/early Summer item. Current demand analysis shows a significant surge in Period 14 (257 units), which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This follows a steady period where demand averaged ~168 units. The jump to 257 represents a ~50% increase over the previous 4-week average, signaling the start of the peak summer retail period as we enter mid-May. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout history. To prevent further lost sales during this anticipated peak, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand spike (explicitly set to 257 to ensure the OR backend targets this new high) and increasing sigma_hat (using recent_N=3) to account for the increased volatility observed in late April and May (demand fluctuated from 154 to 257).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand surge: Period 14 saw a 50% increase in demand (257 units) compared to the March/April average (~169), signaling a new high-demand regime for the peak summer season.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is entering the peak summer season (late May). Period 14 showed a massive demand spike to 257 units, and while Period 15 moderated to 174, the overall trend since mid-May is significantly higher than the spring average (~169). The average of the last two periods (257 + 174) / 2 = 215.5. Given the product is a 'fitted strappy top' and we are approaching June, I expect demand to remain in this higher volatility 'summer peak' regime. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this shift and ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers this elevated demand level. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, which I will continue to use. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a stable buffer around the current mean.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering early June (Period 17), a time when demand for basic jersey tank tops typically stabilizes at a high summer baseline. Historical demand analysis shows a significant surge in Period 14 (257 units), followed by a return to moderate levels in Periods 15 and 16 (174 and 151 units respectively). The average demand over the last three periods (since the 'Summer peak' started) is 194 units, which is significantly higher than the previous Spring average of ~168. Given the product's high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend's service level target is high (~95%). Although the last two weeks showed demand below 180, the early June calendar date suggests we should remain prepared for volatility or sustained summer heatwaves. I will use a 'recent_N' of 3 for mu_hat to capture the current summer regime (avg ~194), while setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' of 5 to account for the increased volatility observed since mid-May. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Post-Period 14 surge, demand has averaged ~194 units per week, up from the Spring baseline of ~168 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019, which is approaching the peak of summer for 'Basics' and 'Jersey Basic' tanks. While Period 17 saw a sharp decline in demand (89 units), I must reconcile this against the overall Summer Peak demand profile observed in previous periods (P14: 257, P15: 174, P16: 151). The June/July period in retail often sees volatility due to stock-outs or early clearance-seeking behavior, but for a basic cotton tank, demand usually stays high during warm months. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the Summer regime (P14-P17 avg: 167.75), which balances the high peak of Period 14 with the low slump of Period 17. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to incorporate the increased variance observed during this transition into Summer. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (2019/6/17), the Anita Tank SKU is experiencing a significant demand cooling. While May saw high demand (avg ~200+), the last two periods (P17, P18) have dropped sharply to 89 and 92 units respectively. This suggests the 'Summer Peak' noted in Period 15 was short-lived or shifted due to early season pull-forward. We are now seeing a low-demand regime for late June, likely returning closer to early spring levels or lower as mid-summer lulls hit basic apparel. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the shift from the high of Period 15 (174) and 16 (151) down to the current lows (~90). This results in a mu_hat of approx (1+0)*126.5. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given high on-hand (159), the OR backend will correctly minimize new orders to prevent excessive holding costs while current stock depletes.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand cooling detected: Week 24/25 (June) demand dropped to ~90 units, a ~50% decrease from the May average (~194), indicating the initial summer peak has subsided into a seasonal lull.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) has entered a mid-summer cooling phase. Following a surge in May (averaging ~194 units), demand in the last three periods (P17-P19) has dropped significantly and stabilized at a lower mean of 91.33 units (89, 92, 93). This indicates a clear demand regime shift as recorded in the history and carry-over insights. With the current date being June 24th, we are likely in a seasonal lull before any late summer or back-to-school activity. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this new lower demand baseline (avg ~91). This allows the OR engine to right-size the base stock level to approximately 100-110 units, accounting for the current on-hand of 104 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 19: Mid-summer demand has cooled significantly, dropping from a May average of ~194 units to a stable June baseline of ~91 units (P17-P19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear shift. The product being a 'Jersey Basic fitted strappy top' saw peak demand in mid-May (P14-P15), followed by a significant cooling in June where demand stabilized around ~98 units. Period 20 demand (117) shows a slight uptick from the 91-unit June average, potentially indicating the start of a mid-summer rebound or simply high variance. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently stocked out (0 on-hand, 0 in-transit). To capture the current 'cooled' regime while being robust to the slight uptick seen in Period 20, I will use recent_N with N=4 (covering the end of June/start of July period: 89, 92, 93, 117). This N is chosen to isolate the post-peak summer lull. L remains at the promised 0.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Jersey Basic Fitted strappy top', a staple item in summer. We are currently in early July (2019/7/8). Historical demand shows a clear shift: from a late March/April/May average of ~170-190 units, demand significantly dropped in June to a stable 'lull' regime averaging ~98 units (Periods 17-21: 89, 92, 93, 117, 90). The previous carry-over insight from Period 20 correctly identified this mid-summer cooling. However, since we are moving into the peak of summer (July), we should monitor for a potential rebound or maintain this updated lower baseline. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 5 weeks of the 'summer lull' (approx. 98 units/week), which effectively captures the shift from the high May demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) has entered a stable mid-summer demand regime following a high-demand spring and early summer peak. Demand over the last four periods (P19-P22) has been consistent at 93, 117, 90, and 93 units, respectively (averaging ~98 units). This confirms the cooling trend noted in previous carry-over insights. Total inventory visibility shows the product is currently at a low on-hand status (23 units) with 0 in-transit. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this stabilized lower demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using N=4 to reflect the current reduced volatility. This approach ensures we maintain a leaner inventory profile while the product is in its seasonal mid-summer lull, minimizing holding costs while meeting demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a fitted strappy tank top. We are currently in late July (2019/7/22). History shows a clear demand cooling since early June. The May peak (avg ~194) dropped to a June baseline of ~91. In July (Periods 21-23), demand has continued this lower trend with values of 90, 93, and a further drop to 56 in the most recent period. As summer progresses toward late July/August, demand for summer basics often continues to decline as the season shifts. The recent 3-period average is 79.7, and the most recent 5-period average (including the 117 spike in P20) is 89.8. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the stable lower demand while acknowledging the most recent decrease to 56. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand cooling: July demand (Periods 21-23) has averaged ~80 units, continuing the downward trend from the May peak (~194) and June average (~91).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) has entered a late-summer cooling phase. Demand has dropped from a May peak of ~194 to a June average of ~91, and has further declined in July to an average of ~71 (Periods 21-24: 90, 93, 56, 47). The most recent two periods (56, 47) suggest a continued downward trend as the peak summer season concludes. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the remaining demand, I am using a recent_N window of 5 periods (Periods 20-24) to capture this cooling regime. This period (P25, late July) likely precedes a further seasonal decline into August.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand decay confirmed: July demand (Periods 21-24) averaged ~72 units, but the most recent two weeks (Periods 23-24) averaged ~52 units, indicating a significant acceleration in the post-summer cooling trend.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Fitted strappy top', a highly seasonal basic apparel item. We are now in early August (Period 26). Demand history shows a clear seasonal decay: July (Periods 21-25) averaged 65.8 units, but the most recent three weeks (Periods 23-25) have dropped significantly to 48.6 units (56, 47, 43 respectively). This confirms the 'late summer cooling' identified in the carry-over insights. Given the steady decline as we move towards late summer/early autumn, I am setting mu_hat to reflect this current regime. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent, lower demand levels (averaging ~49 units) rather than the higher July average. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 85 units, which already covers nearly two weeks of the current demand rate, so the OR backend should naturally moderate the order size to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand floor detected: Demand has stabilized at ~49 units over the last 3 periods (P23-P25), down from the early July average of ~91. This represents the likely seasonal baseline for late summer/pre-fall.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is a basic jersey tank top, which has experienced a significant seasonal decline as summer ends. The demand has dropped from a May peak of ~194 units and a June average of ~91 units to a stable low in late July and early August. Over the last four periods (P23-P26), demand has been 56, 47, 43, and 32 respectively, with the last three averaging ~40.7 units. As we are now in mid-August (2019/8/12), demand for this basic strappy top is expected to remain at this lower 'late summer/early fall' plateau. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game history. With 57 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we are already covered for approximately 1.4 periods of demand at the current average rate (~40 units/period). I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to ensure we don't over-order during this seasonal cooling, while maintaining the 'default' lead time (0 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand stabilization at seasonal low: August demand (at Period 26) has further dipped to 32 units, following a July average of ~72 units. The current 3-period average is ~40 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (basic strappy tank top) is experiencing a consistent late-summer demand decline. Recent demand samples show a clear stabilization at a lower baseline: P25 (43), P26 (32), and P27 (47). The average of these last three periods is approximately 41 units. This aligns with the 'carry-over insights' indicating a shift to a seasonal low in August. Given the product category (basic jersey tank), demand is likely to remain at this floor or continue a slight decline as the season transitions toward fall. I will set the demand mean (mu_hat) using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this current 40-unit floor, which is significantly lower than the long-term historical mean. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the reduced volatility at these lower volume levels. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, which I will continue to handle using the 'default' method.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Late summer demand floor confirmed; demand has stabilized around ~40 units (P25-P27 average) following the post-July cooling trend.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is a basic jersey top. Historically, demand for this item has cooled significantly as summer ends. For the last four periods (P25-P28), demand has been 43, 32, 47, and 46, averaging approximately 42 units. This confirms a stable late-summer/pre-fall floor as noted in previous insights. The current on-hand inventory is 8 units with 0 in-transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain the service level while minimizing holding cost during this established low-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current 42-unit demand level and its associated volatility. This will ensure we order enough to meet the upcoming week's demand while acknowledging the sharp drop from the earlier July peaks.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is a basic jersey top. Demand has significantly cooled as we enter September, following a clear seasonal decay from its summer peak. In the last period (Period 29), demand dropped to 17 units, the lowest recorded. The average demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) is ~35.5 units, but the most recent figure of 17 suggests the 'late summer floor' may be giving way to an even lower 'autumn baseline'. With the current on-hand inventory at 37 units and demand trending downwards, we already have sufficient stock to cover the expected demand for at least two periods. lead_time remains stable at 0. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs during this low-demand phase, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the cooling trend while acknowledging the recent low of 17. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Autumn demand cooling confirmed. Demand dropped to 17 units in late August (P29), significantly below the previously identified 'late summer floor' of ~40 units. New seasonal baseline is estimated at <25 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is a basic summer item now entering the autumn season (September). We have observed a sharp and sustained decline in demand over the last month: August demand fell to ~30-45 units, and the most recent two periods (P29-P30) have dropped significantly further to 17 units and 8 units respectively. This confirms the 'Autumn cooling' insight noted in Period 30. The current on-hand inventory is 51 units, which already covers more than 3-4 periods of demand at the current rate (average of last 3 periods is ~24, but the last 2 are ~12). To prevent excessive holding costs during this terminal phase of the product's seasonal cycle, I am setting mu_hat to reflect this new low-demand regime. Using recent_N=3 captures the rapid descent (averaging ~23.6 units) which, when combined with the OR backend's logic, will likely result in a zero or near-zero order given the 51 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand collapse confirmed: Late August/Early September demand (P29-P30) averaged 12.5 units, down from the early August average of ~40. The product is likely entering its end-of-season phase.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Anita Tank) is in a significant end-of-season decline, moving from a late-summer baseline of ~40 units (P25-P27) to an autumn average of 11 units over the last three periods (P29: 17, P30: 8, P31: 8). This matches the expected lifecycle for a 'Garment Upper body | Vest top', which is highly seasonal. With on-hand inventory at 49 units, we already have approximately 4.5 weeks of supply based on the current demand rate (~11 units/week). To avoid excessive holding costs on a fading SKU, I will set mu_hat to its current low regime using the recent_N method (N=3) to reflect this collapse. Observed lead time remains 0. No new orders should be triggered by the OR engine as on-hand exceeds the new base stock levels.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Jersey Basic fitted strappy top, which has completed its primary spring/summer lifecycle. Current demand has collapsed from a summer peak of ~194 to a low-volume autumn phase. Over the last four periods (P29-P32), demand has been 17, 8, 8, and 12 units (mean = 11.25). On-hand inventory is 37 units, which covers more than 3 weeks of the current demand rate. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent unnecessary holding costs as the product enters its end-of-season/clearance phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect this low-demand state and allow existing inventory to satisfy demand without placing new orders.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor confirmed: September demand (P29-P32) has stabilized at a very low average of ~11 units per week, representing a 90%+ drop from the seasonal peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'fitted strappy top in soft jersey,' which is a summer-seasonal basic. Current date is September 30th (Period 34), entering the deep Autumn/Winter season. Demand has fundamentally collapsed from its summer peak (~194 units) to an 'end-of-season' floor. Historical demand for the last five periods (P29-P33) is 17, 8, 8, 12, and 18, averaging 12.6 units. The most recent demand (18) shows a slight fluctuation but does not indicate a trend reversal. With 19 units on-hand and a promised lead time of 0, current stock covers the expected demand for the immediate period (~12.6 units) plus a small safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this low-demand baseline while ignoring the higher August figures. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility at these low volume levels. Lead time is consistently 0, so I will maintain 'default'.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (basic jersey tank top) is in a consistent end-of-season demand floor. October 7th observations confirm that demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the last 6 periods (P29-P34) showing demand of 17, 8, 8, 12, 18, and 10 units respectively. The mean demand for this recent period is approximately 12.1 units. With on-hand inventory at 11 units and no in-transit orders, the stock almost matches the 1-week requirement. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this October/Autumn baseline accurately. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect the low volatility of this floor. Lead time remains stable at 0. This approach ensures we maintain minimal stock to avoid holding costs during the liquidation/end-of-life phase.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226003 (Anita Tank) is a seasonal basic (fitted strappy vest top) which has transitioned through a significant summer peak and is now in its end-of-season/Autumn phase. Observations from Periods 29 through 35 show demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 11.14 units per week. Specifically, the last four periods (P32-P35) have seen demands of 12, 18, 10, and 5. With current on-hand inventory at 15 units, the pipeline is sufficient for at least one more period of low demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a declining product, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this low-volume floor (approx 11 units/period). Inventory is nearly aligned with this requirement.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Anita Tank) is in a deep end-of-season demand regime. Over the last 8 periods (P29-P36), demand has averaged approximately 10 units per week (17, 8, 8, 12, 18, 10, 5, 14). The most recent 3-period average (P34-P36) is 9.7 units. Current inventory is low (7 on-hand). Given the high critical ratio (19/20 = 0.95), we should maintain enough stock to cover this late-season baseline while avoiding excessive holding costs as the game nears its end (Period 47). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this stabilized low-demand regime, and keep L at the default promised lead time of 0 periods, which has been consistently met.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a fitted strappy jersey top, which is highly seasonal and currently in its end-of-season/autumn phase (late October). Demand has stabilized at a very low level. Over the last five periods (P33-P37), demand values were 18, 10, 5, 14, and 11, moving the average to approximately 11.6 units per week. This aligns with the 'End-of-season demand floor' identified in Period 33. On-hand inventory is currently 9 units, with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this low-demand baseline and avoid overstocking during this terminal phase of the product cycle. This approach minimizes holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the remaining low-volume sales.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Anita Tank) is a jersey basic vest top, currently in the late autumn season (early November). Demand has been extremely low and stable since September (P29), confirming the end-of-season regime. Specifically, demand over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) has averaged 10.7 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) averaging 9.2 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With on-hand inventory at 14 units and a current average demand around 9-10 units, the OR backend needs to maintain a low base stock to avoid unnecessary holding costs while covering the immediate period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand baseline while filtering out minor weekly noise.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Fitted strappy top', a highly seasonal basic item that has settled into a low-demand baseline for the late Autumn season. Demand over the last 8 periods (P32-P39) has averaged approximately 10.5 units per week, ranging between 5 and 18. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P36-P39) have shown a tight cluster around a mean of 9.75 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory as the game approaches its conclusion (P47) while meeting this low-level demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods. This longer lookback period for the mean is used to smooth out the slight volatility (5-18 range) and ensure the base_stock calculation remains stable around the currently observed demand level.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Anita Tank) is a basic summer/spring item (vest top) currently in its deep off-season (November). Demand has been extremely low and stable since September. Over the last 12 periods (P29-P40), the average demand is 10.1 units. The most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) show an average of 8.8 units, confirming a consistent end-of-season floor. Lead time remains stable at 0. With 13 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we are already covered for the next period's expected low demand (~9 units). I will use a recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable off-season mean, which will likely result in a very small replacement order to maintain this minimal safety stock as we approach the end of the game (Period 47).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Anita Tank' is a basic jersey strappy top, currently in the late autumn/winter season (late November). Historical demand since September (Period 29 onwards) has remained consistently low, stabilizing at an 'end-of-season' baseline. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P34-P41) show an average demand of approximately 8.4 units per week, with very low volatility (standard deviation around 3.3). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. With 13 units currently on-hand and a predicted demand of ~8 units per period, the existing inventory is nearly sufficient for the immediate period, but a small replenishment is needed to maintain the service level across the review and lead time window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this late-season stable low-demand regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The customer demand for the Anita Tank (a basic jersey vest top) has remained at a consistent end-of-season low throughout October and November. The last 10 periods (P33-P42) show a mean demand of approximately 9.1 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P39-P42) have seen weekly demand of 8, 5, 5, and 9 units (avg 6.75). With the current date being December 2nd, there is no expectation of a seasonal spike for this basic summer-oriented item. On-hand inventory is currently at 5 units. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19), we aim to maintain enough stock to cover the current period's demand. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average to capture this stable, low-demand regime, ensuring we do not over-order as the game nears its end (P47). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season stable regime confirmed: October and November demand (P35-P42) has averaged ~8.5 units per week, establishing a firm winter baseline for this basic summer item.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, and the product is a cotton-blend tank top (basic summer item). As noted in previous carry-over insights, the product is in its winter baseline/end-of-season regime. Demand from Period 35 to Period 43 has been extremely stable at a low average of ~8.3 units per week. The most recent demand (Period 43) was only 2 units. With on-hand inventory at 15 units and pipeline inventory at 0, we already cover approximately two weeks of the current average demand. Since the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, and we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 47), there is no need for large orders. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture the consistent winter baseline (Periods 35-43) for both demand and volatility, and maintain the default lead time of 0.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Jersey Basic Fitted strappy top', which is seasonally relevant for Summer but currently in its winter baseline regime. Since Period 35 (early October), demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 7.5 units per week (Periods 35-44). The most recent demand observations (Periods 43 and 44) were 2 and 3 units respectively, which is even lower than the prior 8.5 average, though likely still within the variance of the winter floor. Given the promised lead time of 0 (which has been consistently met), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this stable winter baseline (approx 7.5 per period). Since the cost of holding is low ($1.0) compared to the profit ($19.0), a slightly conservative sigma_hat using the same N is appropriate to prevent stockouts while avoiding excessive overflow for a product currently at its seasonal minimum. On-hand inventory is 12 units, which is sufficient to cover about 1.5 weeks of demand at the current rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Fitted strappy top', a highly seasonal summer basic. Demand has been in a low, stable winter regime since October. Over the last 10 periods (P35-P45), demand has averaged 7.5 units per week, with a recent slight fluctuation (P43: 2 units, P45: 14 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With a lead time of 0 (consistently observed throughout the history), I need to cover Period 46 demand. The OR backend uses a base stock policy. I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the stable winter baseline, which will provide a mu_hat of approx 7.5 * (1+0) = 7.5. This allows the system to order enough to meet current low demand while minimizing holding costs for this out-of-season item.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Divided Basics' tank top, currently in the deep winter season (late December). Consistent with the Carry-Over Insights from Period 43, demand has stabilized at a very low winter baseline. Over the last 4 periods (P43-P46), demand has been 2, 3, 14, and 9 (average 7.0). The spike to 14 in P45 is likely a minor holiday-related fluctuation but the overall trend remains low. On-hand inventory is 6 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. For the final period of the year, I will use recent_N=4 to capture this stable winter demand regime (approx 7 units/period) and use the default lead time of 0. This ensures we maintain a small stock buffer without over-ordering into the new year.
