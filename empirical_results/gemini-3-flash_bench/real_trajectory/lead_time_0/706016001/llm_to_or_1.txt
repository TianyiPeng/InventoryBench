Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a super-skinny high-waisted denim trouser. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 688.8 units (694, 576, 685, 715, 774). There's a slight upward trend in the most recent two weeks (715, 774). Since the promised lead time is 0, the total demand over the review and lead period (1+L) is theoretically one week. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the service level target (critical ratio) is 0.5 (z=0). This suggests we should target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent mean, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat to establish a baseline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch high-waisted denim trouser. Looking at historical demand (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04), demand was relatively stable between 576 and 774, with a mean of approximately 689. Period 1 demand was 671, which aligns with this baseline. However, we are moving further into mid-February. Standard retail patterns for denim often see a slight uptick as consumers begin transitioning to spring wardrobes. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0 (ordered P1, arrived P1). On-hand inventory is very low (18 units) because the initial order of 689 was nearly depleted by demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture the most relevant recent baseline (689, 774, 715, 685, 576) while allowing the OR backend to set a safe base stock. Sigma will also be set via recent_N to reflect the observed volatility (~70-80 units).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch high-waisted skinny jean. The date is 2019-02-25. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) averaged ~688.8 units. Observed demand in Period 1 (671) and Period 2 (673) aligns closely with this baseline. Based on the calendar, we are entering the spring season, which typically sees steady demand for core denim items. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), verified by Period 1 and 2 conclude messages. On-hand inventory is low (12 units), and there is no pipeline inventory. Since demand is stable and profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0), the base stock level will target the mean demand. I will use the recent history (N=5 including the 3 latest samples and the 2 recent game periods) to project demand and variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $374.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is a baseline denim item with high turnover. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks including game history) are: 694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673, 539. The average demand across all 8 samples is approximately 666 units. Period 3 saw a dip to 539, which might be a random fluctuation or a softening after a peak. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period in P1, P2, and P3). On-hand inventory is currently 165. Since L=0, the target base stock needs to cover only the current period's demand (1+L=1). I will use the average of all samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as there isn't a strong enough signal for a regime change yet, but the holding cost equals the profit (Ratio 1:1), which encourages the OR backend to set a service level around 50% (z=0), essentially ordering up to the mean. This helps avoid high holding costs if the demand dip persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch high-waisted jean. Current date is March 11. Historically, demand for early weeks (Jan/Feb) averaged ~692 units. However, in Period 3 (Feb 25) and Period 4 (Mar 4), demand dropped to 539 and 447 respectively. This suggests a post-winter/pre-spring transition or a cooling of the initial high-demand period observed in Jan/Feb. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since demand appears to be trending downwards, using the last 3 samples (Periods 2-4: 673, 539, 447) provides a more responsive mean of 553 units compared to the overall historical average of ~660. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the fact that holding cost equals profit (1:1 ratio), the OR backend will target a 50% service level (z=0), meaning we aim to stock the mean. Stocking exactly the mean avoids excessive holding costs for a product with significant demand variance and unit costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 3 (Feb 25): Demand decreased from a 5-period average of ~700 to an average of ~500 in the last two weeks (-28%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $383.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (March 18), we are managing skinny denim trousers. The carry-over insight correctly identified a demand drop starting in Period 3 (Late Feb). The last 3 periods (P3, P4, P5) show demands of 539, 447, and 468, respectively, averaging ~485 units. This is a significant decrease from the early season average of ~680. Leading up to spring, this particular style (washed superstretch skinny denim) might be stabilizing as early-year shopping peaks subside. Given the inventory level of 85 and a consistent lead time of 0 (observed in all 5 concluded periods), I will set L to 0. For demand (mu_hat), I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this lower volume regime (avg 485). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this new regime. This approach prevents over-ordering and high holding costs (since profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, requiring a balanced stock level).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Reviewing the history, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand regime shifted at Period 3; while the first two weeks (Feb 11-18) saw demand ~670, the subsequent four weeks (Feb 25 - Mar 18) transitioned to a lower level, averaging approximately 489 units (539, 447, 468, 502). The last period (Period 6) ended with a stockout (sold 485 but demand was 502, ending inventory 0) because the previous order was slightly conservative given the recent volatility. To stabilize, I will use recent_N demand statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this current regime (Periods 3-6). Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend will target a 50% service level for the base stock calculation (q=0.5, z*=0), but the OR engine's cap will allow for higher safety stock (0.95 quantile) to mitigate stockout risks observed in Period 6.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime (Periods 3-6) for SKU 706016001: mean demand is ~489 units, significantly lower than the ~700 seen in late January/early February.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), the product (Skinny Denim Trousers) has transitioned from a high-demand regime in early 2019 (~680-700 units) to a stabilized lower-demand regime. Average demand from Periods 3 to 7 is 493.4 units, with the last two periods showing slightly higher demand (502, 511) which led to stockouts (ending inventory 0). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $1 profit (equaling a 50% service level target), I will focus on the recent demand regime. mu_hat will use recent_N=5 (Periods 3-7) to capture this stable ~500 unit level, while sigma_hat will use the same window to reflect the moderate volatility (std ~40) observed during this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $494.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8). The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently experiencing stockouts due to high service level tension (Profit/Holding cost ratio of 1:1, implying a 50% target service level in base stock equations). Over the last three periods (P6-P8), ending inventory has been 0, and sold units have been limited by on-hand inventory, indicating demand is likely slightly higher than the actual sales. Specifically, demand in P8 was 560, while we only sold 494. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 4, demand has stabilized into a regime between 447 and 560. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this post-shift regime (P4-P8), which averages ~498 units. Given the stockouts, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5, but I will slightly increase sigma_hat using an explicit value based on the standard deviation of this stable period (~44) to ensure the OR backend's capped policy doesn't restrict the order too much during this modest upward trend in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-shift (Period 4 present) is stabilizing around a mean of 500-515 units, trending upward; stockouts in P6-P8 suggest the OR backend's default safety stock is insufficient for a 50% target service level.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), on-hand inventory is 163. Historical lead time is consistently 0 (arriving same period). The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 3/4. Initially, demand was ~700, then dropped to ~500. Periods 6-8 saw stockouts as demand hovered between 502-560, while Period 9 saw a drop to 335. The carry-over insights suggest the OR backend's default safety stock (targeting a 50% service level because Profit=Holding Cost implies z=0) is too thin, resulting in stockouts even when demand is only slightly above mean. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the lower mean demand, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set N=6 (Periods 4-9) to capture the post-shift regime (avg ~470). By using recent_N for sigma_hat instead of 'default', the OR engine will calculate a volatility representative of this new lower-demand regime rather than the high-variance total history (including the ~700 era).

After a high period average of ~700 (P1-P2), it dropped to ~500 (P3-P8), and has recently plummeted further in the last two weeks: P9 demand was 335 and P10 was 269. This decline likely reflects a post-Easter/Spring season cooldown for this specific denim SKU. Lead time is consistently 0. The current on-hand inventory is 202 units. Given the sharp downward trend in the last two weeks, using a long-term average would result in significant overstocking. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the recent mean (approx 388 units) and volatility more accurately than the longer-term regime. This will help the OR backend set a base stock that reflects the current lower demand level while maintaining the 50% service level target (implied by the equal profit and holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Deepening demand decline observed starting Period 9 (Apr 8). Demand has dropped from a stable ~500 regime to an average of ~302 in the last two periods (-40%), likely seasonal cooling.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/29. Demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has entered a lower regime. Since Period 9 (April 8), demand has been consistently lower: 335, 269, and 261 (mean \u2248 288). This follows the previous regime (Periods 4-8) where demand averaged ~500. The carry-over insight from Period 11 correctly identified this seasonal cooling. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). I will use recent_N with N=3 for the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters to capture this current downward trend and lower volatility, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the much higher historical averages from February and March. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.50, and these parameters will help the model maintain a leaner inventory appropriate for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level (April/late Spring): Periods 9-11 show a mean demand of 288, down from the ~500 mean in March.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6). The SKU (Skinny Denim TRS) is in a stabilized lower-demand regime following a sharp drop in April. Demand in the last four periods (P9-P12) was 335, 269, 261, and 339, yielding an average of 301. The stockout in Period 12 (demand 339, sold 289) suggests the OR backend is cutting orders too aggressively using the 'default' logic, which may be overweighting the historic 700+ units peak or failing to provide enough safety stock for the current variance. I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current regime of ~300. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent another stockout and ensure a 50% service level (Profit = Holding Cost), I will use the recent_N method for sigma_hat (N=4) to ensure the safety stock reflects current volatility (~37.5), as the default standard deviation over the whole history is inflated by the early February peak.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 corresponds to mid-May. Historical demand analysis shows a clear shift: periods 1-2 averaged ~670, periods 3-8 averaged ~500, and periods 9-13 have averaged 289 (335, 269, 261, 339, 241). The latest regime (P9-P13) is stabilized around a mean of ~290. While the product is a staple (skinny denim), seasonal cooling in late spring is evident in the data. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all concluded messages. To align the OR backend with this lower demand regime and avoid overstocking while holding costs equal profit ($1.0/$1.0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime behavior (May demand) specifically.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny denim trousers) is experiencing a continued decline in demand as late spring progresses into early summer (May 20). Following the shift identified in Period 11, demand has further softened. The last three periods (P12-P14) show demand levels of 339, 241, and 189 respectively, averaging approximately 256 units. The most recent demand (189 units in P14) suggests the cooling trend remains active. Given the 1:1 ratio of profit to holding cost ($1.0 each), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z-score = 0). Since the lead time has been consistently 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime (mean of P11-P14: ~257 units) while excluding the higher April peaks. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility of this lower regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for 706016001 has entered a deeper trough in May: Periods 12-14 average ~256 units, a significant decrease from the early-April average of ~288 and the March average of ~500.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a highly volatile demand phase. While the previous carry-over insight noted a trough averaging ~256 units (Periods 12-14), Period 15 showed a significant spike to 375, resulting in a stockout. Historically, demand for this item has moved in regimes: ~700 (Jan/Feb), ~500 (March), and ~250-300 (April/May). The recent jump to 375 suggests we may be moving out of the May trough or experiencing temporary volatility. With profit ($1) equal to holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. However, given the zero ending inventory in Period 15 and the recent spike, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (Periods 12-15 mean: ~286) to capture the upward pressure while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat is set to explicit=80 to account for the high volatility seen in Period 15 (jump from 189 to 375) and to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering during this potential transition. Actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) has experienced a significant and sharp demand recovery over the last two periods (P15: 375, P16: 533) after a long period of decline through April and May. This recovery likely aligns with early June seasonal shopping patterns for lighter denim. My previous 'recent_N' settings failed to capture this rapid spike, leading to stockouts in Period 15 and 16. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit (which equals holding cost at $1), I am shifting to an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat at 450 units (average of the last two spikes) and providing a higher 'explicit' sigma_hat of 120 to increase the safety stock buffer, as the current volatility is extremely high (jump from 189 to 533 in three weeks). Lead time remains 0 based on history.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed starting Period 15: Demand surged from a May average of ~256 to a late-May/early-June average of ~454 (+77%), likely reflecting summer seasonality.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a strong summer recovery phase. Demand in the last three periods (P15-P17) has surged to an average of 453 units (375, 533, 451), compared to the May average of ~256. At P17, with an order of 450 against demand of 451, we stock out immediately. To prevent lost sales during this high-demand period, I am shifting the mu_hat forecast to use recent_N=3 to capture this new elevated regime. I am also increasing sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility (standard deviation ~79 units) during this recovery. Actual lead time remains consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand recovery for 706016001 confirmed: Period 15-17 mean demand has stabilized at ~453 units, recovering from the May trough of ~256 (+77%).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is in a mid-summer demand recovery phase. Comparing the recent demand (Periods 15-18: 375, 533, 451, 462; Mean ~455) to the May trough (Periods 12-14: Mean ~256), we see a sustained shift. The last two periods (P17-P18) specifically have shown remarkable stability near 450-460 units. Although there were stockouts in P15-P18 due to the rapid recovery, the 'In-transit' is currently 0 and on-hand is 0, meaning we must rely on the Period 19 order (Lead Time 0) to meet this week's demand. I will set L=0 based on consistent historical performance. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 (capturing the recovery since P15) to calculate a mean of (375+533+451+462)/4 = 455.25. Since Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the backend target service level is 50%; however, to mitigate the recent string of stockouts and handle the high variance seen in P16 (533), I will also set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to ensure the safety stock is responsive to current volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a summer demand regime. Following a trough in May (avg ~256), demand spiked and stabilized from Period 15 to 18 at approximately 453 units. Period 19 showed a slight dip to 358 units, but given the stockouts in Periods 15-18, the demand signal remains strong. The current mean demand for the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 435 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). With Profit and Holding cost both at 1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend will target the mean. To ensure we capture the current summer demand level while accounting for the recent slight softening, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the post-recovery data. Since lead time is zero and stable, L is set to default.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st. After a strong summer recovery in June (averaging ~450/week), demand has softened in the last two weeks: P19 was 358 and P20 was 265. This cooling likely signals the passing of the initial peak summer shopping phase for 'superstretch skinny denim'. Historically, transitions for this SKU are abrupt. The average of the last 6 periods (the current summer regime) is ~407. however, the most recent 2 periods average ~311. To avoid overstocking while holding costs are equal to profit ($1/unit), I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this recent softening while maintaining a buffer. I've set L to continue using the promised 0-period lead time as it remains consistent. mu_hat will use the last 6 periods (since the start of the summer recovery in P15) to capture the current seasonal context, which averages ~407 per week, or 814 for (L+1) demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed late June: Demand dropped from a mid-June average of ~453 to a late-June average of ~311 across P19-P20 (-31%).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8) for SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim TRS). Demand patterns show a cooling trend since late June. The average demand for the last three periods (P19-P21) is 325.33 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 21. Specifically, P21 demand was 353, P20 was 265, and P19 was 358. We are currently in a lower demand regime compared to the early-June summer peak (~453), but demand is not as low as the May trough (~256). Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture this post-peak stabilization. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 will forecast demand around 325-330 units. sigma_hat with recent_N=3 will account for the recent volatility (265 to 358) ensuring sufficient safety stock for equal profit and holding costs (target service level 50%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-summer peak (starting Period 19): Mean demand is ~325 units across P19-P21, reflecting a 28% decrease from the mid-June peak (~453).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the demand for skinny denim trousers is showing signs of recovery after the late-June dip. Period 22 demand was 393 units, which is significantly higher than the previous three-period average of ~325 units. This suggests the demand regime is stabilizing in a mid-range (350-400 units) following the summer peak (450+ units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 22, the system ordered 271 units which, combined with 55 units on-hand, resulted in a stockout (sold 326 vs demand 393), indicating that current parameters are slightly under-ordering for the current volatility. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the post-summer-peak behavior (P19-P22 average is ~342), but I'll set an explicit mu_hat slightly higher (400) to account for the recent upward tick to 393 and prevent further lost sales. Given Profit=Holding=$1, the target service level is 50%, but with high volatility (sigma), a slightly more aggressive base stock is needed to avoid stockouts during demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 22: Recent demand (393) suggests a stabilization between 350-400 units, higher than the late June average of ~325.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a mid-summer demand regime. Analysis of the last 5 periods (P19-P23) shows demand values of 358, 265, 353, 393, and 369. While P22 and P23 show a slight recovery compared to the late June dip, the overall mean for this 5-period window is ~348. Recent carry-over insights correctly identified a stabilization between 350-400 units. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this current stable regime (mean ~348), which is higher than the previous month's trough but lower than the June peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. Using N=5 for sigma_hat will provide a volatility estimate (~49) that allows the OR backend to maintain an appropriate safety stock given the 50% target service level (profit $1 vs holding cost $1).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a post-summer transition phase (Late July). Following a recovery in June to averages of ~450, demand has cooled and stabilized. Recent performance (P22-P24) shows demand values of 393, 369, and 232. While P24 (232) is a notable drop, it follows two weeks of higher demand (~380). The 'recent_N' approach with N=4 captures this local volatility (including the high P22 and low P24) better than a longer-term average. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.00), meaning the OR backend's target service level is 50%; setting L=0 and using a recent window for mu and sigma allows the back-stock calculation to stay responsive to current fluctuations without over-stocking during the late-summer cooling period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late July (P22-P24): range 232-393, mean ~331. This follows a stabilization period, suggesting a potential downward trend or increased sensitivity to end-of-summer clearance cycles.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), SKU 706016001 (superstretch denim trousers) shows a stabilizing demand pattern after the late-July volatility. Periods 22-25 recorded demands of 393, 369, 232, and 298 respectively, averaging approximately 323 units. The product category and timing (August) suggest we are moving out of summer peak into late-summer/pre-autumn demand. Given the stockout risk seen in Period 22 when demand spiked unexpectedly, I will use a conservative window to capture current demand levels. I am choosing N=4 for mu_hat to weigh the most recent month of activity (averaging ~323), and N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the higher volatility seen throughout July. Promised lead time remains 0 and consistent with delivery history (L=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26 (Aug 5), demand was 381, following a period of 298. This indicates a potential late-summer demand uptick or volatility continuation as observed in late July. The current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (381) exceeded available stock (323). The actual lead time remains 0. Given the recent demand bounce back from the low of 232 (P24) to 381 (P26), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P22-P26) which averages ~335. This helps capture the recent volatility and recovery without being overly influenced by the deep mid-May troughs. With profit and holding costs equal, the target service level is 50%, but since we have consistently stocked out when demand spikes, the OR backend's default variance calculation needs sufficient recent samples to protect against this stockout behavior. N=5 covers the shift from late July into early August.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Late summer demand recovery/volatility confirmed (P22-P26); mean demand has risen to ~335 from the July low, though stockouts still occur when demand exceeds 350. Actual lead time consistently 0.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. For SKU 706016001, we observe a significant demand spike in Period 27 (493 units), which is the highest since early summer and well above the recent mean of ~335 units. This suggests a transition from the late-summer period into a back-to-school or early autumn demand regime for this 'Divided Collection' high-waisted denim. The actual lead time remains 0. Given the stockout in Period 27 (sold 335 on demand of 493), I am increasing the forecast to capture this upward movement. Using recent_N with N=6 (Periods 22-27) for mu_hat would only yield ~361, which is too low given the 493 signal. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat to 475 to prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the inventory was depleted in the previous period. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the increased volatility (232 to 493 range) observed in this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 27: Demand surged to 493 units (+47% vs recent average of ~335), likely driven by back-to-school seasonality for the Divided denim collection.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a back-to-school demand surge. Period 27 demand was 493 and Period 28 was 432, averaging ~463 units. This confirms the shift noted in Period 28's carry-over insight, moving from a summer average of ~335 to a new higher regime. Given the date (late August), this elevated demand is expected to persist as students return to school/university. I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods (N=2) to quickly adjust the base stock to this higher level (~463 per period). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=2) to capture the increased volatility associated with this transition. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' replenishment, so L=0.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime confirmed: Period 27-28 mean demand is ~463 units, up 38% from the previous summer average (~335).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. We are in the back-to-school demand regime for the Divided collection skinny denim. Following a demand surge in mid-August (P27-P28), demand softened slightly in P29 to 396 units. The confirmed mean for this current regime (P27-P29) is 440 units, significantly higher than the previous summer average. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure we capture this higher demand level and prevent the stockouts seen in P26 and P27, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the current back-to-school trend. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility associated with this seasonal peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/09/09) context: Demand for SKU 706016001 (Divided denim) surged to 740 units in Period 30, following a back-to-school upward trend (P27-P29 mean ~440). This 740 volume is the highest observed since early February, likely representing the peak of the back-to-school shopping season. The inventory stocked out (sold 441 of 740 demand), resulting in 0 on-hand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this significant spike and prevent further stockouts during what appears to be a high-demand seasonal window, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I will average the last 4 periods (P27-P30: 493, 432, 396, 740), which results in a mean of 515.25. Given the stockout and the upward momentum, I will set mu_hat to 550 to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient. Sigma_hat is set to 200 (explicit) to account for the high volatility seen in the 740-unit spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand peak detected in early September (P30: 740 units). Back-to-school regime (P27-P30) now averages 515 units, significantly higher than July/August levels (~335) and showing high volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (Divided Denim) has entered a high-volume 'Back-to-School' regime starting around Period 27 (mid-August). In the last two periods (P30 and P31), demand spiked significantly to 740 and 708 units respectively, resulting in consecutive stockouts despite increasing orders. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is approximately 554 units, but the last two weeks suggest a new peak level above 700 units. To address this and prevent further stockouts during what appears to be a sustained September peak, I am selecting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the start of the surge) and setting sigma_hat to explicit/200 to account for the high volatility seen in the 740 vs 396 unit swings. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 will result in a base stock that covers the ~554 average plus a significant safety buffer for the 700+ peaks.

Carry-over insight: September Peak confirmed: Demand for P30-P31 averaged 724 units, a 40% increase over the early Back-to-School average of ~515.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand September peak (Back-to-School/Fall transition). Demand for the last three periods (P30-P32) has been 740, 708, and 707, averaging ~718 units. This is a significant jump from the early August average of ~463. Despite increasing order parameters previously, we have stocked out for three consecutive periods because the OR backend's safety stock calculation (at a 50% service level target, given Profit=1 and Holding=1) is too lean for this high-volatility peak. To capture this demand and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 720 (reflecting the current 3-week stable peak) and increasing sigma_hat to 100 to force higher safety stock. Actual lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: September demand peak confirmed for SKU 706016001: Periods 30-32 show sustained demand averaging ~718 units, a 55% increase over the August 'back-to-school' start (~463).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (Sep 30) shows a massive demand surge in Period 33, reaching 1428 units (double the recent average of ~718). This aligns with a significant transition into late September/early October, likely a peak driven by seasonality for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' (Divided collection). Given the stockout in P33 and the historical trend of increasing demand throughout September, the underlying demand mean is clearly shifting upward significantly. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the September surge (P30-P33), but even that average (~895) might be too conservative given the P33 observation of 1428. I set mu_hat explicitly to 1100 to provide a robust base stock that bridges the gap between the recent average and the current extreme peak, while maintaining sigma_hat on the last 4 periods to account for the heightened volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 450). Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Major demand surge detected in late September (P33: 1428 units), more than doubling the early September average of ~718 (+99%). This indicates a new extreme demand regime likely tied to early autumn fashion peaks.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) experienced an extreme demand spike in Period 33 (1,428 units), which subsided to 748 units in Period 34. This behavior suggests a transition from a 'hyper-peak' (possibly a major promotion or early autumn fashion drop) to a stabilized but still very high autumn regime. The local mean for the last two periods (P33-P34) is roughly 1,088 units, while the mean for the broader September/October window (P30-P34) is approximately 866 units. Given the inventory-holding cost is 1.0 and unit profit is 1.0, the target service level is 50%. Setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 provides a balanced forecast of approximately 866 units, which accounts for the most recent extreme surge while acknowledging the subsequent partial cooling. Sigma_hat is set to explicit (400) to account for the massive variance seen in the last few weeks (ranging from ~700 to ~1400) ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety buffer despite the primary goal of a 50% service level. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Extreme demand volatility in late September/early October. Following a peak of 1,428 (P33), demand stabilized at 748 (P34). The current autumn regime (P30-P34) averages ~866 units, significantly higher than the early September average of ~515 (+68%).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-October, historically a high-demand period for the 'Divided' denim collection. Recent demand has stabilized into an autumn regime: P30 (740), P31 (708), P32 (707), P33 (1428 - outlier peak), P34 (748), and P35 (606). While P35 shows a slight cooling compared to the massive P33/P34 peak, the mean remains significantly elevated compared to August. Calculating based on the last 6 periods (P30-P35) provides a mu_hat context of ~822 units per period. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime while smoothing the extreme volatility seen in P33. Promised lead time (0) continues to be reliable. Since Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the backend's target service level is q=0.5. Given the high volatility (sigma), using recent_N for sigma_hat with the same window ensures that the safety stock is appropriately scaled to recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (starting P30) is significantly higher and more volatile than the back-to-school period; mean demand across P30-P35 is ~822 units, with a major peak of 1428 in late September (P33).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in an autumn demand regime. After a massive peak of 1,428 units in P33 (late September), demand has moderated but remains high and volatile, with the last three periods (P34-P36) averaging 645 units (748, 606, 581). This levels off the extreme volatility seen in September but remains significantly higher than the summer and early back-to-school averages. The actual lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high holding cost equal to profit ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (q = 0.5), which relies heavily on accurately estimating the mean (mu_hat). I will use a recent_N method with N=7 to capture the full trajectory of this autumn regime (including the P33 peak) to ensure mu_hat reflects current high-level demand while providing enough safety stock to prevent stockouts if another peak occurs. Setting N=7 covers P30-P36, which encompasses the entire shift from back-to-school to the current autumn levels.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: After the P33 peak (1428), demand in P34-P36 has stabilized at a lower but still elevated mean of ~645 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 34-37) is stabilizing after the extreme late-September peak (P33). The current autumn regime shows a mean demand of approximately 645 units (606, 581, 643 in the last three weeks). The date is October 28, moving into late autumn. Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized autumn demand while remaining responsive to potential volatility (as seen in the late-September surge), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the current 600-750 unit demand level, moving away from the outlier of 1428 in Period 33, while providing enough safety stock to handle the observed variance in the autumn garments (skinny denim).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 4th, 2019. We are in the post-peak autumn demand regime for this skinny denim product. Recent demand since Period 34 (late Sept/Oct) has been relatively stable, averaging approximately 648 units (P34: 748, P35: 606, P36: 581, P37: 643, P38: 663). While earlier autumn saw an extreme peak of 1,428, the last five weeks have settled into a tighter range. However, we sold out in Period 38 (starting on-hand 645, demand 663), indicating that our safety stock is slightly too low to capture upside volatility in this stable-but-high regime. Actual lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized autumn average of ~648, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this specific period rather than the extreme spikes seen in September.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Stable autumn demand regime confirmed (P34-P38); mean demand has stabilized at ~648 units after the late-September peak, with moderate volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Divided Denim) is currently in a stable autumn demand regime following the peak in late September. Period 39 demand was 485, which is a decrease from the previous five-period average (~648), potentially signaling the start of a late-autumn cooling or a return to normal levels after the high-season peak. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To calculate mu_hat, I am using a recent_N window of 6 (Periods 34-39) to capture the demand stabilization after the P33 outlier (1428 units), as this reflects the most current and relevant demand level (~622 units per period). I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect the current volatility (std ~95) while avoiding the distortion from the massive P33 spike. This approach balances the need to maintain stock for current demand levels while acknowledging the slight downward trend observed in the most recent week.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Potential late-autumn demand cooling detected (P39: 485 units, -25% vs P34-P38 average of 648). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has entered a late-autumn phase. Following the major peak in late September (P33), the demand regime stabilized around 645 units but has shown cooling in the most recent two periods (P39-P40), with an average of 533 units (485 and 581). This suggests the high-autumn peak is transitioning into a lower winter baseline. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 40). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this cooling phase while maintaining service levels, I'm setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering the post-peak stabilization and the recent cooling) to capture the trend decrease. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to reflect the recent demand volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Continued late-autumn demand cooling confirmed. Mean demand for P39-P40 is 533 units, a 17% decrease from the P34-P38 average of 648 units.

After a peak in late September and a stable October mean of ~645, the last three periods (P39-P41) have shown a lower average of 537.6 (485, 581, 547). This supports the earlier carry-over insight of a cooling trend. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this cooling phase while maintaining a sufficient service level (profit and holding cost are equal, suggesting a 50% target critical ratio from the base stock formula), I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific cooling regime. This aligns the inventory with the current 530-550 unit demand level. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (P39-P41) confirmed: mean demand has stabilized at ~538 units, representing a 17% decrease from the October average of ~645.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand for SKU 706016001 spiked to 3,100 units, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (a massive 5.7x increase over the previous 3-period average of ~538). This extreme outlier completely depleted on-hand inventory. Given the date (Dec 2), we are now entering the holiday shopping season. While the 3,100 spike is likely a singular event, demand is expected to remain significantly higher than the late-autumn regime. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 850, which is approximately 1.5x the pre-spike level, to capture elevated holiday demand without overreacting to the Black Friday peak. sigma_hat is set explicitly to 300 to account for high seasonal volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme demand spike of 3,100 units observed in Period 42 (Nov 25), coinciding with Black Friday. This marks the transition from the late-autumn regime (~538) into a highly volatile holiday demand regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (Divided Collection) spiked to 3,100 units due to Black Friday, far exceeding the preceding late-autumn mean of ~538. Period 43 demand retreated to 674 units, which is higher than the pre-Holiday regime, suggesting a sustained holiday-elevated baseline. We are now in the December holiday shopping peak. Historically, Black Friday is a single-period outlier, but December demand remains high and volatile before the post-Christmas drop. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P39-P43) which captures the pre-peak cooling, the peak itself, and the post-peak recovery, averaging ~1,077. This prevents overreacting to the 3,100 spike while accounting for the high floor in December. I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the extreme volatility (stdev of last 5 periods is ~1,135) to ensure the OR backend generates sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts like the one seen in P42. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: Period 42 spike (3,100) and Period 43 follow-up (674) indicate a highly volatile December baseline significantly higher than the November mean of ~538.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the December holiday season (Dec 16). Period 42 saw a massive Black Friday spike (3,100), and demand has since settled into a higher-than-average holiday baseline (P43: 674, P44: 680). The average demand for the most recent two normal holiday periods (P43-P44) is 677 units, which is a 26% increase over the late-autumn baseline (~538). Given the superstretch skinny denim product category, high demand is expected to persist through late December for gift-giving and holiday events. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 2 periods to capture this stabilized holiday mean, while using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed since late November (Black Friday), ensuring the OR backend provides sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts during this critical period.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime stabilizing (P43-P44): mean demand is ~677 units, representing a sustained ~26% increase over the November baseline (~538).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/23. We are in the immediate pre-Christmas/Holiday week. Historically, after the massive Black Friday spike (P42), demand has stabilized at an elevated mean of approximately 670 units (P43-P45: 674, 680, 657). With Christmas falling in the current period (P46), demand is expected to remain high or slightly increase before the post-holiday cooling. Lead time has been consistently 0 throughout the history. The on-hand inventory is very low (20 units), so we need to order sufficient stock to meet the expected 670-700 unit demand for this period. I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to capture this stable holiday regime, but I will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen during the transition from the autumn regime and the potential for holiday-related demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime stabilized (P43-P45): Mean demand has settled at ~670 units, a 25% increase over the November baseline, following the Black Friday outlier.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Dec 30 (P47), moving out of the peak holiday shopping season into the post-holiday clearance/January lull. Looking at recent demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim): P43-P45 were stable around 670 units, but P46 saw a significant drop to 475 units (a 29% decrease). This suggests the expected post-holiday cooling. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the transition into January, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the shift from the holiday peak (674, 680, 657) to the new lower observation (475), which provides a mean of ~621. This balances the risk of overstocking during the Jan-Feb slowdown while maintaining enough buffer for the 'Divided' collection's core demand. Holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0), implying a 50% target service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Post-holiday demand cooling detected in late December (P46: 475 units, -29% vs P43-P45 average of 670). Anticipating transition to January baseline.
