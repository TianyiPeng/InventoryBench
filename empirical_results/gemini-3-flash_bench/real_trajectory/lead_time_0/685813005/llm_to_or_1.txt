Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data for the PETAR SWEATSHIRT (685813005) shows 5 samples with a mean of 46.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 8.7. The dates (Jan-Feb) suggest a winter/early spring demand pattern for sweatshirts. Promised lead time (L) is 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To ensure the OR engine correctly sets the base stock (mu + z*sigma) for this 0-lead time environment, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current demand regime. Since L=0, mu_hat should effectively represent 1 period of demand (1+0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the provided historical demand for SKU 685813005 (Petar Sweatshirt), the demand samples are [50, 38, 43, 60, 43] (avg ~46.8). In Period 1, we observed a demand of 51, which is consistent with this range. The promised lead time is 0, and the Period 1 conclusion confirms an actual lead time of 0 (ordered 47, arrived 47 in the same period). However, we stocked out in Period 1 (sold 47 out of demand 51) because the starting inventory was exactly what we ordered. To avoid stockouts in Period 2, I will set mu_hat based on the average of all available samples (including P1) which is approximately (50+38+43+60+43+51)/6 = 47.5. Since L=0, the backend formula for mu_hat is (1+L)*mean. I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture all recent data points. I will use 'default' for sigma_hat to allow the backend to calculate volatility from the full sample set.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, and we are managing a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT'. The promised lead time is 0 periods, which has been confirmed by arrivals in Period 1 and Period 2 within the same period they were ordered. Historical demand data shows a stable range (38-60 units) until Period 2 (Date 2019/02/18), where demand spiked to 97. This jump aligns with early spring transitions and potentially localized events or sales. Given the stockouts in P1 and P2 (ending inventory 0, sold < demand), we must increase our stock levels. With Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the backend aims for the mean demand. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=2) to capture the recent growth trend and use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture recent volatility without overreacting solely to the P2 spike. L is set to default as the 0-period lead time is consistent.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. Historical demand for the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' shows a significant spike in Period 2 (97 units) compared to the initial samples (avg ~47) and Period 3 (58). Reviewing the calendar, late February and early March often see transitions in seasonal apparel. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to set the base stock to cover the expected demand for the current period. Given the high volatility in the last three periods (51, 97, 58), the mean is approximately 68.6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent higher demand regime while maintaining a buffer for volatility. Setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (avg 68.7, so (1+0)*68.7) and sigma_hat using the same window to address the high standard deviation observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 11 (Period 1): Average demand increased from pre-game ~47 to ~69 (+46%) with high volatility (SD ~24).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand for the PETAR SWEATSHIRT shows a significant shift starting in Period 1 (Feb 11). Pre-game demand averaged ~47, but since Period 1, observed demand has been 51, 97, 58, and 44 (mean ~62.5). While Period 4 demand (44) returned to a lower level, the surge in Period 2 (97) indicates high volatility. Promised lead time is 0, and 'Period X conclude' messages confirm actual lead time has consistently been 0. On-hand inventory is 25 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this more volatile regime since the shift in Period 1. Setting mu_hat using N=4 (encompassing the 4 game periods) adjusts the base stock to historical game performance rather than the more stable pre-game history. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility (SD ~24) observed recently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18. Analysis of historical demand (P1-P5) shows a peak in Period 2 (97 units) followed by a steady decline (58, 44, 29). The initial carry-over insight noted a shift to an average of ~69, but the last two periods (44 and 29) suggest demand is reverting or declining as we move further into March. This is a sweatshirt (winter/transition garment), so a seasonal decline in mid-March is plausible. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 5 demand was only 29 and inventory is 34, there is a risk of overstocking if demand continues to drop. I will use recent_N (N=5) to weight the recent game history more heavily than pre-game data, as it captures the recent volatility and the downward trend better than the full historical average. The OR backend will balance the $1/$1 profit-to-holding ratio (q=0.5), resulting in a base stock approximately at the mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand appears to be on a downward trend post-February peak (declining from 97 in P2 to 29 in P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25. Historical demand for this sweatshirt (685813005) showed a peak in February (Period 2: 97 units) followed by a significant decline as the season transitioned towards Spring. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has stabilized around a mean of 36.7 units (44, 29, 37). The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. Given the high holding cost (equal to profit), the system must avoid overstocking. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'post-peak' regime while remaining responsive to potential further seasonal declines as we move deeper into March/April.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-peak: Avg demand for last 3 periods (P4-P6) is ~37, significantly lower than the P1-P3 avg of ~69.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. Looking at the history, the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' experienced a demand spike in February (Periods 1-3, peak of 97 in P2) likely due to seasonal weather, followed by a cooling period in March. However, Period 7 showed a surprising rebound in demand to 50 units (exceeding our stock), while the previous three periods (P4-P6) averaged 36.6 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since we ended Period 7 with 0 units on hand and missed 13 units of demand (lost sales), we need to recalibrate to handle the volatility. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (Periods 4-7) to capture the trend transition from late winter to early spring, giving an average demand of (44+29+37+50)/4 = 40. This balances the recent lows with the most recent spike. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to capture the increased volatility (11.7 to 40-50 range).

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound observed in Period 7 (April 1st): Demand increased to 50 units after a three-period average of ~37, suggesting potential volatility or a smaller secondary seasonal lift in early spring.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a sweatshirt, which typically sees demand fluctuations in early spring as weather transitions. Analyzing historical demand since the start of the game (P1-P8), we see an average demand of approximately 51.5 units per period. However, the last two periods (P7 and P8) saw demand of 50 and 44, respectively, which is higher than the P4-P6 average (~37) and closer to the overall mean. Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, meaning we are stock-out sensitive. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Given the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend logic will target a 50% service level. To prevent lost sales while managing holding costs during this volatile transition period, I will use a recent demand window to capture the current stabilized mean. I'll use N=5 (P4-P8) to calculate mu_hat, resulting in a mean of (44+29+37+50+44)/5 = 40.8. Since promised L=0, the OR engine calculates base stock for (0+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) at an average of ~41 units, recovering from the P5 low of 29. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15th. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a basic jersey top with soft brushed inside, likely transitioning out of its peak winter/early spring season. Recent demand has stabilized: Period 9 demand was 36 units, following 44 and 50 in previous periods. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P4-P9) is approximately 40 units (44, 29, 37, 50, 44, 36). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. Since the profit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0), the service level target q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. At this service level, the OR backend aims for the median demand. I will use the recent 6-period regime (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stabilization after the high-volatility February peak, reflecting the current lower but stable demand level as the weather warms.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' plummeted to 18 units in Period 10, the lowest observed since the game began. As we are in late April (2019/4/22), we are likely seeing a seasonal decline for sweatshirts as warmer weather approaches. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is approximately 32.6, but the most recent figure (18) suggests a sharp drop-off. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent excessive holding costs in a high-holding-cost environment ($1 vs $1 profit), I will adjust the mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime shift (N=3) to capture this downward trend, while utilizing a broader sigma (N=7) to protect against the inherent volatility seen in earlier spring weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 10 (mid-April): Demand dropped to 18 units, reinforcing the seasonal decline for sweatshirt products as spring progresses.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a cool-weather item. As the date is April 29th, moving fully into late spring/early summer, demand for sweatshirts is expected to remain low or continue a seasonal decline. The demand in recent periods (P10: 18, P11: 22) supports this lower regime, with an average of 20 units over the last 2 weeks. The previous stabilization around 40 units (P4-P8) has clearly ended. On-hand inventory is currently 11. Given equal profit and holding costs ($1), and a lead time of 0, the OR backend logic targets a 50% service level plus a buffer. I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture this lower late-spring demand level while accounting for the slight volatility seen between 18 and 22 units. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand spiked to 41 units (up from 22 and 18), which likely exhausted stock and left zero ending inventory. The product is a 'soft sweatshirt fabric' item. As we enter May (Period 13, May 6th), we are in a transitional weather period. Historically, May demand for this SKU (from pre-game data in January) suggests levels around 40-50 units. While Period 10-11 showed a decline, Period 12 signals a secondary peak or late-season demand. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (approx 30 units) but adjust L and sigma to handle the stockout risk seen in Period 12. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Secondary demand peak observed in late April/early May (Period 12 demand = 41), reversing the previous downward trend and causing a stockout.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The PETAR sweatshirt is entering mid-May. While seasonality for sweatshirts traditionally declines in spring, recent data shows a secondary peak in late April and early May (P12 demand 41, P13 demand 30). In Period 13, demand exactly matched arrivals (30), leading to an ending on-hand inventory of 0. Current on-hand and in-transit are both 0. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game. Given the recent recovery in demand compared to the low in Period 10 (18 units), I will use a 4-period window (P10-P13) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This N=4 captures the low of 18, the spike of 41, and the stabilization at 30, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for current volatility and prevents under-ordering during this unexpected late-spring lift.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT'. Current date is May 20th. As spring progresses into summer, demand for sweatshirts generally declines due to warmer weather. However, historical data shows significant volatility: Period 12 saw a spike to 41, Period 13 was 30, and Period 14 settled at 25. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 27.2 with a standard deviation of 8.8. Given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which aligns the base stock closely with the mean demand. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To account for the recent stabilization while acknowledging the seasonal decline, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~27 units (which covers Period 15), and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a sweatshirt. Historical demand for the last five periods (P11-P15) has been [22, 41, 30, 25, 38], averaging 31.2 units. We just experienced a stockout in Period 15 where demand (38) exceeded starting on-hand (28). As summer approaches in late May, demand for sweatshirts is expected to remain relatively low but volatile, as evidenced by the fluctuations between 22 and 41. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR target service level is approximately 50%. Given the recent fluctuations and the stockout, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current late-spring demand regime, ensuring the OR engine reacts to the recent volume levels while acknowledging the high variance (ranging from low 20s to low 40s).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late spring (May) is volatile but averages ~31 units, fluctuating between 22 and 41.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the product (Petar Sweatshirt) is entering the summer season. Despite expectations of a seasonal downturn for sweatshirts, demand has actually increased in the last two weeks (38 in P15 and 44 in P16), resulting in stockouts and lost sales because the system was under-provisioned. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high parity between profit and holding costs (q=0.5, z*=0), the base stock effectively targets the mean demand. Over the last 5 periods, the mean demand is ~36 units; however, the last two specific observations (38, 44) suggest a volatile but higher-than-average late-spring floor. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent volatility while remaining responsive to the upward trend seen in P15-P16, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the demand fluctuations between 25 and 44 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in late May (P15-P16), with demand rising to an average of 41 units vs a previous 5-period average of ~31, leading to consecutive stockouts.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a sweatshirt, which typically faces declining demand as summer approaches. Period 17 saw a sharp drop in demand to 13 units, following a volatile period in late May where demand averaged ~41 units. This drop likely signals the start of the summer lull. Despite this, the service level requirement (q = 0.5 given Profit=1 and Holding=1) is low, but the OR engine's 'cap' mechanism ensures we don't over-order. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 periods (P13-P17) to capture the recent volatility and the latest drop, resulting in a more balanced forecast than the long-term average. Lead time remains stable at 0. The goal is to avoid overstocking a seasonal item as it enters its off-season while still covering the potential for lingering late-spring demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 (June 3): Demand dropped significantly to 13 units from a previous 4-period average of ~35, signaling the expected summer seasonal decline for sweatshirts.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a sweatshirt, which is entering its seasonal low period (summer). As identified in Period 18, demand has dropped significantly. Recent demand samples show a regime shift: P17 (13 units) and P18 (15 units), averaging 14 units per period. This is a sharp decline compared to the late-May average of ~41 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand. I will use a recent_N of 2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot directly to this new low-demand summer regime, preventing excess holding costs. With 15 units already on-hand, the 'recent_N' approach will likely result in a very small order, which is appropriate as we draw down inventory to match the seasonal drop.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a soft sweatshirt, which is a seasonal item experiencing declining demand as we enter the summer months. Historical demand over the last three periods (P17-P19) has dropped significantly to 13, 15, and 3 units respectively, averaging approximately 10.3 units per period. This confirms the summer seasonal low noted in the Carry-Over Insights. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which aligns with using the mean demand (mu_hat). Given the recent sharp decline and the very low demand observation from the previous period (3 units), I will use the last 3 samples (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current summer regime, minimizing holding costs for this seasonal item while maintaining sufficient stock for the lower expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for summer season (starting June): Average demand dropped to ~10 units (P17-P19) from a late-spring average of ~35.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. The product is a soft sweatshirt, which is a seasonally sensitive item. The demand history confirms a significant summer seasonal decline: demand has dropped from a late-spring average of ~38 (P15-P16) to an average of 8 over the last four periods (P17: 13, P18: 15, P19: 3, P20: 1). This aligns with the expected lifecycle of mid-to-heavyweight garments during summer months. In the last two periods (P19-P20), demand has been extremely low (average of 2 units). Given the current on-hand inventory of 11 units and this minimal demand regime, I am setting parameters to avoid further accumulation of stock and minimize holding costs. I use N=4 for the recent demand regime (starting P17) to capture the summer shift. Since lead time has consistently been 0, I use 'calculate' for L.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, in the middle of the summer season. As previously identified, the demand for this sweatshirt product has dropped significantly since June (Period 17). Demand over the last five periods (P17-P21) has been 13, 15, 3, 1, and 7, averaging 7.8 units per period. This confirms the summer demand regime previously noted. Current on-hand inventory is 4 units. With profit and holding costs being equal ($1.0), the service level target (critical ratio) is 0.5, meaning we want to stock to the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent low-demand regime and avoid overstocking and high holding costs, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (P17-P21). This provides a representative sample of the current low-demand summer phase.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which has been in a sustained low-demand summer regime since June (Period 17). However, Period 22 observed a sudden demand spike to 19 units, higher than any demand seen since early June, causing a stockout. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P17-P22) is roughly 9.7 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P20-P22) have shown an upward trend (1, 7, 19). Given the item's seasonal nature (sweatshirt), demand should remain relatively low during July, but we must protect against these volatility spikes to avoid further stockouts. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the summer average while accounting for the recent spike, and use an explicit sigma_hat of 10 to provide extra safety stock against the high variance observed in Period 22 (SD of the last few periods is high relative to the mean).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand spike observed in Period 22 (July 8): Demand rose to 19 units, deviating from the previously stable June/July average of ~6 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are managing a sweatshirt SKU, which is in its low-demand summer season. However, we recently observed a mid-summer demand spike in Period 22 (19 units) and significant demand in Period 23 (10 units), causing a stockout. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P17-P23) is approximately 9.7 units, but the last two periods averaged 14.5 units. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. Since we are currently at zero inventory and expect slightly elevated mid-summer demand compared to the June lows, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the recent summer volatility while moving past the high-demand spring data. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in the depths of summer, typically the lowest demand season for sweatshirts. Historical demand over the last 8 periods (since P17/June) has averaged approximately 9.6 units per week, including a mid-summer spike in P22 of 19 units. The most recent three periods (P22-P24) show demand of 19, 10, and 9 units, suggesting the P22 spike was a temporary deviation rather than a regime shift. Stockouts occurred in P22 and P23 because the backend's 'cap' mechanism likely limited the order size based on the very low June averages. Current on-hand is 1 unit. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50%. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the summer demand regime (June-July samples). This balances the low June demand (~5 avg) with the slightly higher July demand (~12 avg). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5 (Period 26). The product is a sweatshirt, which is seasonally sensitive. We observed a significant demand spike in Period 25 (23 units), compared to the previous 7-period average (P18-P24) of ~8 units. This likely signals the start of the 'Back to School' or early autumn transition, where demand for layers like sweatshirts begins to rise after the mid-summer low. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high volatility and the potential start of a new upward regime, I will use a short window (recent_N=5) to capture this upward movement (mean ~14, but shifting) While a stockout occurred in P25, the increased demand in late July suggests we need to raise base stock levels to prevent further lost sales during this seasonal ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 (July 29): Demand increased to 23 units, signaling the start of the late-summer/autumn recovery for sweatshirts, deviating from the summer average of ~8 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' is showing signs of its expected early-autumn recovery. Recent demand history shows a shift from the mid-summer low (avg ~7) to a higher level: Period 25 = 23 units, Period 26 = 16 units. The product is a sweatshirt, which typically sees increasing demand as the weather cools in late August and September. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Based on the recent uptick in demand (averaging ~20 units over the last two periods) and the seasonal context, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this emerging trend while remaining responsive. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), suggesting a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will calculate via the base stock policy.

Carry-over insight: Early autumn recovery confirmed: Demand shifted from avg ~7 in June/July to avg ~20 starting Period 25 (July 29).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are in the SKU category 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT'. As documented in the carry-over insights, we are observing a significant autumn recovery. Demand in Period 27 spiked to 48 units, which is much higher than the previous few weeks (23, 16). This aligns with seasonal patterns for sweatshirts as the weather begins to cool down. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. Since Period 27 demand was 48 and caused a stockout, and the previous recovery stage (P25-P26) averaged around 20, I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for this continued upward trend. I am targeting a base stock level around 50-55 to capture this growth while being mindful of the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (requiring a 50% service level). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the start of this autumn regime (P25-P27: 23, 16, 48), which yields an average of 29; however, given the explicit jump to 48, I will use an explicit mu_hat to ensure we don't under-order during this rapid climb.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn demand surge confirmed: Demand spiked to 48 units in Period 27 (Aug 12), following a secondary recovery start in late July, confirming a strong seasonal upward trend for sweatshirts.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Petar Sweatshirt) is entering its primary autumn sales season (late August). Historical data from Period 1-4 (February/early March) showed peak demand levels between 50 and 97 units. Period 27/28 saw a sharp climb (48 and 35 units respectively), and we are currently seeing demand consistent with pre-season levels from early 2019. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P26-P28 demand: 16, 48, 35) which averages ~33. Since autumn sweatshirt demand typically accelerates, I am using a recent_N of 3 to stay responsive to the upward trend while capturing the recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0. Choosing recent_N for sigma_hat ensures the safety stock accounts for this high-growth volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. We are in the midst of an autumn demand recovery for the PETAR SWEATSHIRT, a category highly sensitive to seasonal cooling. Demand has been significantly higher than the mid-summer lows (which were ~7-10), with the last three periods (P27-P29) recording 48, 35, and 22 units respectively (average ~35). Although P29 dipped to 22 units, the arrival of September usually triggers further sustained interest in sweatshirts. I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition from summer to autumn while allowing the OR engine to react to the high volatility seen in P27. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which I will continue to rely on.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9th, 2019. We are seeing a significant demand surge for the Petar Sweatshirt, consistent with autumn seasonality in the northern hemisphere. Specifically, Period 30 (Sept 2) saw a demand of 76 units, which is the second-highest observed in the entire history, following the initial February peak. The previous 5-period average (P26-P30) is approximately 39.4 units, but the last period spiked to 76, causing a total stockout. To prevent further lost sales during this active recovery phase, I will increase mu_hat using recent data that captures this uptick. Given the high volatility (fluctuating between 22 and 76 in the last 3 weeks), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the current trend while acknowledging the increased uncertainty. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn peak confirmed: Demand spiked to 76 units in Period 30 (Sep 2), following a month of recovery. Demand is now trending towards early-game levels (Feb avg ~69).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32 (Sep 16), clearly in the peak autumn/fall season for sweatshirts. Historical demand over the last two periods (P30-P31) has been 76 and 60 units, significantly outpacing our ordering. The stockout in Period 31 (on-hand 40, demand 60) confirms that current demand is consistently high. The carry-over insights correctly identified this upward trend starting late August. I estimate the current demand regime has stabilized near the original February peak of ~60-70 units. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 70 to ensure we meet this peak demand. sigma_hat is set to 15 to account for the volatility seen in high-demand periods (e.g., the jump from 22 to 76 in P30). Lead time remains reliably 0. On-hand is currently 0, so the base stock will drive the full order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Autumn peak demand confirmed to be in the range of 60-75 units per period (Avg of P30-P31 is 68).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in the peak autumn season for sweatshirts. Historical demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) has been 76, 60, and 48, averaging 61.3 units. While the last period saw a slight drop to 48, the overall regime remains high compared to summer levels. Lead time is consistently 0. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock policy will target the median demand. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat to capture this high autumn demand while acknowledging the slight cooling in the most recent sample. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N with N=5 to capture the volatility of this recovery phase (SD of P28-P32 is approx 21). This approach ensures we maintain enough stock for the peak season while preventing excessive overstock as we navigate the volatility of the autumn trend.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813005 (sweatshirt) has entered a high-demand autumn phase. Period 33 observed a massive demand spike to 138 units, significantly exceeding the previous 'autumn peak' range of 60-75. This suggests either an extreme outlier or an accelerating seasonal surge as October approaches. Given the product category and the date (Sept 30), high demand is expected to persist. Lead time remains stable at 0. Because of the recent stockout (sold 62 units against 138 demand), I must aggressively set mu_hat to capture this higher regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the shift that began around Period 30 (averaging ~80 units/period) while reflecting the recent volatility. This prevents the OR backend from under-ordering relative to the new, higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed for late September: Demand reached 138 units in Period 33, representing a major acceleration from the early September average of ~68 and causing a large stockout.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the sweatshirt SKU 685813005 is experiencing a strong seasonal surge as we enter October. Period 33 saw a massive peak of 138 units, and Period 34 remained high at 102 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The recent 2-period average (P33-P34) is 120 units, while the 5-period average (P30-P34) is approximately 85 units. Given the transition into colder months and the recent stockouts, I need to set mu_hat aggressively to cover this surge. I will use 'explicit' values to ensure the OR backend generates a high base stock. I'll set mu_hat to 130 to account for potential further growth or stabilization at the high end of recent demand, and sigma_hat to 40 to handle the high volatility (SD of last 5 periods is ~38). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for October: Demand averaged 120 units over P33-P34, significantly exceeding September levels (~60-70).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak mid-October season (Period 36, Oct 14) for the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT'. Historically, demand has surged significantly from September (~60-70 units) into October, which has averaged 112.6 units (138, 102, 98) over the last three periods. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Demand in Period 35 (98 units) was slightly lower than the extreme spike in Period 33 (138 units), but remains at a high 'autumn/winter' regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current high-demand October regime (P32-P35: 48, 138, 102, 98) which averages 96.5 units. Given the high volatility (sigma), this will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the mean and the risk of another spike. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the forecast is tuned to the current seasonal peak rather than being diluted by low summer demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813005 (sweatshirt) is currently in its peak autumn demand season. Since late September (Period 33), demand has shifted significantly higher, averaging approximately 103 units per period (P33: 138, P34: 102, P35: 98, P36: 73). While Period 36 showed a decline to 73, this is consistent with the high-volatility peak seen earlier in the season. The current on-hand inventory is 24 units. To maintain service levels during this high-demand phase while accounting for the recent volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Given the regime shift confirmed at Period 35, I will use N=4 (spanning Periods 33-36) to capture the current high-demand average (~103) and its associated standard deviation. Observed lead time has remained stable at 0 periods throughout the game, so the default lead time parameter is retained.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for October peak confirmed: Average demand over the last 4 periods (P33-P36) is 103 units, with substantial volatility (Range: 73-138).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, representing the transition from the peak October demand for sweatshirts. Demand in Period 37 was 106 units, and the average over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is 103.4 units, with high volatility (range 73-138). While October has been strong, historical data from February (P1-P3) saw an average demand of ~69. We are entering late autumn/early winter, where demand for 'soft brushed inside' sweatshirts remains seasonally high, but the intense early October peak might be tempering. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0. Given the high demand and recent stockout in Period 37, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to handle the high volatility through the recent standard deviation.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering the peak winter season for sweatshirts. Historical data shows demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime since late September. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P33-P38) is approximately 103 units (138, 102, 98, 73, 106, 102), with significant volatility. The most recent demand (P37-P38) confirms this level remains consistent around 100+ units. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture this sustained high-demand plateau while accounting for the recent variability in sigma_hat. This approach ensures sufficient base stock to avoid the frequent stockouts observed in October while balancing against holding costs as we maintain a roughly 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late autumn/early winter (Nov) solidified: Average demand over P33-P38 is ~103 units, establishing a high-volume baseline for the peak season.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, the heart of the peak season for sweatshirts. Demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime since late September (Period 33). Over the last 7 periods (P33-P39), the average demand is 112.4 units per period (138, 102, 98, 73, 106, 102, 93). While there was a slight dip to 73 in P36, the general trend remains high and stable around the 100-unit mark. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1/unit), meaning the OR backend will target a 50% service level (the median) by default. Given the sweatshirt's seasonal profile, we expect this high demand to persist or potentially increase as winter approaches. Setting mu_hat to the recent 7-period average (N=7) captures this regime accurately, while sigma_hat (N=7) will account for the recent volatility (ranging from 73 to 138) to buffer against stockouts. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is late autumn/early winter peak for sweatshirt products. Demand over the last 8 periods (P33-P40) has averaged approximately 98 units, with a slight cooling observed in the two most recent periods (93 and 74 units). Despite this slight drop, the product is in its high-season peak. In-transit inventory is zero as the lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1 (suggesting a target service level of 50%), I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime statistics. This ensures we don't over-react to the single lower demand point in P40 while still acknowledging the general peak level.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is the heart of the peak season for sweatshirts. Demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has averaged 92.2 units (106, 102, 93, 74, 86). While there was a slight dip in P40, the recovery in P41 indicates sustained interest. Given the proximity to late November and early December, we should anticipate continued high demand before the eventual Christmas/New Year tapered slowdown. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure we capture this peak while balancing the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each, targeting a 50% service level base stock), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (~92) to reflect the slight softening from the October peak (103 avg) to the current November level (92 avg), ensuring we don't over-order as we approach the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for mid-to-late November stabilized at an average of ~92 units (P37-P41), reflecting a slight decrease from the October peak average of ~103 but maintaining a high-volume baseline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand spiked significantly to 299 units. This coincides with 'Black Friday' week in the United States (the Friday after the fourth Thursday in November), which is a major retail event. For a sweatshirt product (cold weather + gifting), this spike is highly characteristic of local macro-events. Given that this is a one-off extreme event, I will not treat 299 as the new baseline mu_hat, but I must increase the inventory level to account for the possibility of continued high demand through the holiday season (Cyber Monday and December gifting). The ending inventory is 0, indicating a massive stockout. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Historically, demand in December may soften from the Black Friday peak but remain high (Oct/Nov baseline was ~90-100). I'll use a recent_N of 6 to capture the high-volume season (P37-P42) which averages ~110 units (including the spike) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high for the upcoming December weeks.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 299 units in Period 42 (Nov 25) confirms Black Friday seasonal peak for the sweatshirt SKU.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the early December period. Historical demand shows a extreme peak during Period 42 (Black Friday week, demand=299), followed by a significant drop to 75 in Period 43 (post-Cyber Monday). Evaluating the seasonal cycle for sweatshirts, demand typically remains elevated through December due to holiday shopping but generally stabilizes at a level lower than the Black Friday extreme but consistent with the late-autumn baseline of ~90-100 units. Using recent_N=6 (covering P38-P43) for mu_hat yields a mean that balances the high peak with the recent drop, correctly targeting the end-of-year plateau. Lead time is stable at 0. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR engine will capture naturally using these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday stabilization: Demand dropped from the 299 peak (P42) to 75 (P43), indicating a return to the high-volume late-autumn baseline (~90-100 units) for the holiday season.

=== Period 44 Summary ===
685813005: ordered=70, arrived=70 units (ordered on Period 44, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=122, demand=106, sold=106, ending on-hand inventory=16

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has stabilized post-Black Friday at a high-volume late-autumn/winter level. Period 43 and 44 demand (75 and 106) suggests an average of ~90 units, consistent with the pre-Black Friday baseline observed in October and November (Period 37-41 average was ~88). As we approach the end of the game (47 periods total), we need to maintain sufficient stock for the final two periods while avoiding excessive terminal inventory, though with a profit/holding cost ratio of 1.0, the OR engine's critical fractile (0.50) naturally aims for the median demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current stable regime (averaging 120 units including the Black Friday outlier, or ~85 excluding it) and sigma_hat to account for the recent volume variability. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). We are in the heart of the winter holiday season (post-Black Friday). Demand has remained high and stable following the Black Friday spike, with the last two periods (P44 and P45) recording 106 and 121 units respectively. This is consistent with the product being a 'soft sweatshirt' which is highly seasonal towards late autumn and winter. The lead time remains stable at 0. Since we are entering the Christmas/New Year week, demand is expected to remain robust near the 110-120 range before potentially tapering off in January. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this holiday volume (P43-P45 avg: ~101) but explicitly adjust mu_hat slightly higher to 115 to account for the build-up to the final December peak and ensure enough stock for the final two periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand (P44-P45) stabilized at an average of ~114 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime for late December.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, right at the end of the calendar year and following the peak holiday season. Historical demand for this sweatshirt SKU showed a significant spike during Black Friday (P42: 299) and has since stabilized at a high-volume late-year regime. Over the last three periods (P44-P46), demand has averaged 100.33 units (106, 121, 74 respectively). The drop from 121 in P45 to 74 in P46 likely indicates the end of the pre-Christmas surge. For P47, I anticipate a further seasonal decline as we enter January, which historically (pre-game) showed demand around 40-50 units. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (N=3 reflects the post-Christmas cooling while still respecting the higher baseline compared to summer) and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0. This approach ensures we don't over-order as the high-demand winter season begins to taper off.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Post-Christmas demand decline observed; P46 demand (74) dropped 40% from P45 (121), signaling the transition from the peak holiday regime to a standard winter baseline.
