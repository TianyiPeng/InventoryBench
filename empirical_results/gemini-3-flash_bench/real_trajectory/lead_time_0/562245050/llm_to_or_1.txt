Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 562245050 (Womens Everyday Skinny Jeans). Historical demand samples show a mean of approximately 66.6 units per week (97, 57, 65, 61, 55). The first sample (97) appears higher, possibly due to post-holiday sales or initial stocking dynamics, but the last four samples (average 59.5) suggest a stable demand regime. Given the current date is February 11th, there are no immediate major seasonal spikes expected until the transition to spring/Easter. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to set the baseline forecast. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, the backend calculates base stock as (1+0) * mean. On-hand and in-transit are currently 0, so the OR engine needs to place an initial order to cover current period demand. I'll stick to a slightly more conservative recent_N=5 approach to account for the initial higher demand point while focusing on the stabilizing trend.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the SKU (Luna skinny RW jeans), the product is a staple item. Initial demand samples from January (97, 57, 65, 61, 55) show a mean of 67.0 units. Period 1 actual demand was 45, which is lower than the January average but aligns with the slight downward trend seen in early February (55). The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0 (ordered 96, arrived 96). Given the relative stability and the recent slightly lower demand, I will use a recent window (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent behavior without overreacting to the single low data point from Period 1. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to incorporate the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 3 (2019-02-25), the product is women's skinny jeans. The promised lead time is 0 periods, which has been confirmed by arrival reports in Periods 1 and 2. Historical demand from Jan-Feb 2019 shows a range of 55 to 97 units. In Period 2, we experienced a stockout (ending inventory 0, sold 69 against 77 demand), indicating the previous order was insufficient. The average demand across all 7 available data points (5 historical + 2 game periods) is (97+57+65+61+55+45+77)/7 = 65.2. Period 2 saw a spike to 77. Given the stockout and the steady nature of 'Everyday Collection' items, I will use a recent_N strategy (N=4) to capture the recent upward trend in demand while maintaining a buffer. With L=0, the target base stock will be based on 1 period of demand (1+L).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1558.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (Womens skinny jeans) is experiencing a sharp upward demand trend. Historical demand was: 97, 57, 65, 61, 55 (pre-game), then 45, 77, 134 (last 3 periods). The mean of the recent 3 periods is 85.3, but the most recent period saw 134 units demanded. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The promised lead time is 0 and has consistently been 0 in the previous 3 periods. To prevent stockouts and capture the current momentum, I will use recent_N with N=3 for the demand components. This uses the recent mean (85.3) and higher variance to set a more aggressive base stock. Since L=0, mu_hat becomes (1+0) * mean, which the OR engine will calculate as ~85.3. Given the stockouts in P2 and P3, this should trigger a significant order to catch up.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 2: demand increased from an average of ~67 to 134 in Period 3 (+100% vs historical samples). Higher volatility observed alongside growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2320.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans) is experiencing a significant demand shift. Starting from Period 2 and 3, demand surged from a pre-game average of ~66 to values of 134 and 124 in Periods 3 and 4, respectively. This aligns with seasonal transitions in March. Total on-hand inventory is currently 36, which is insufficient for the expected demand. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival (ordered and arrived in the same period). To capture this new demand regime, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 (covering Periods 2, 3, and 4) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock level that reflects the current high-demand state (~111 avg over the last 3 periods), preventing further stockouts.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th (Period 6). Historical demand samples (Early Jan/Feb) averaged ~67, but since Period 3, demand has shifted to a significantly higher plateau (134, 124, 134), averaging 130.67 over the last 3 periods. This represents a sustained growth regime likely driven by the transition into the spring shopping season for women's denim. On-hand inventory is currently low (28). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by successful same-period arrivals in periods 1 through 5. To ensure we meet this higher demand level and avoid stockouts seen in Periods 2 and 3, I am selecting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-demand regime specifically. With a promised lead time of 0, the base stock formula will focus on covering the current period's demand (L=0 means 1+L = 1).

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at ~131 units/period since Period 3 (March), representing a ~100% increase over the January/February historical average of 67. Actual lead time consistently 0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-03-25. Since Period 3 (late February), demand for this SKU (Luna skinny jeans) has shifted from a historical mean of ~67 to a stable high-demand regime averaging ~133 units (P3: 134, P4: 124, P5: 134, P6: 141). The last period (P6) had a stockout (demand 141, sold 141, ending inventory 0), suggesting actual demand may be even higher than observed sales. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for the 100% increase in demand compared to the initial historical samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2755.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Trousers) has shifted significantly again in Period 7 (2019-03-25), jumping from an average of ~133 to 210 units. This mirrors the start of spring fashion cycles in late March. Current observation shows stockouts for two consecutive periods (Period 6 and 7), despite ordering based on the previous ~133-unit regime. On-hand is currently 0, and lead time has consistently been 0. I must adjust the mu_hat to capture this recent spike to avoid further lost sales. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat (averaging Period 5: 134, Period 6: 141, Period 7: 210) to reach approx 162, but given the 210 spike and 0 on-hand, I will use an 'explicit' value of 210 to ensure the base stock is high enough for this new peak. Sigma calculation will also use recent_N=3 to account for increased volatility in this higher-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Demand spiked to 210 from a previous plateau of ~133 (+58%), likely due to spring seasonality for women's denim.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Historical demand for this SKU (Womens Superstretch Denim) shows two distinct upward shifts: first in Period 3 (March) to ~130 units, and then a significant spike in Period 7 (late March/early April) to 210+ units. Period 8 demand reached 223, confirming that we are in a higher spring/seasonal demand regime. The average demand over the last two periods is 216.5. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, allowing for same-period responsive ordering. To capitalize on the current higher volume while minimizing holding costs for this high-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding), I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent two-week average (2 * 216.5 = 433) and using a recent_N sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this higher regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 8: Average demand increased from ~134 to ~216 (+61%) consistent with early April seasonal peaks for denim.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3254.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (April 15). The product is women's skinny jeans. Historically, demand for denim peaks in the spring (March/April). Looking at the history, demand shifted from ~70 (Jan/Feb) to ~130 (March) and then to ~200 (early April). Specifically, Period 7 (210), Period 8 (223), and Period 9 (188) show a significant uplift. The average of these last three periods is 207 units. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Since Period 9's demand (188) was slightly lower than Period 8 (223), the growth might be stabilizing or entering a plateau at this high level. Currently, we have 318 units on-hand. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this high-demand April regime (Avg ~207, StDev ~17.5). Setting L to 'calculate' as lead time has been consistently 0. These parameters will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the current high-demand seasonal peak while acknowledging the existing on-hand stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (Womens Denim) has established a high-demand regime since early April (Period 8). In the last three periods (P8-P10), demand has been 223, 188, and 207, averaging approximately 206 units per week. This aligns with the seasonal peak for '5-pocket jeans' in the spring. Promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 111 units, which is below the expected weekly demand. To maintain a high service level given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), I will set the demand parameters based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this current peak regime (April data). This ensures the base stock calculation accurately reflects the ~206 mean and the recent volatility, preventing stockouts during this critical seasonal window.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (April 29), we are in a high-demand spring regime for women's denim. Looking at the last 5 periods (Period 7-11), demand has averaged 219.6 units per period (210, 223, 188, 207, 270), compared to the earlier March plateau of ~134. There was a significant spike to 270 units in Period 11, indicating increasing momentum as we move further into spring. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since we ended Period 11 with 0 inventory despite a replenishment of 124 units, we must set parameters that capture this elevated mean and higher volatility to avoid stockouts. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this seasonal regime (from 2019/3/25 to present), which provides a stable mean of ~220 and accounts for the recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Demand increased to 270 from an average of ~207 (+30%), indicating a late-spring peak for denim products.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (denim trousers) is currently in a high-demand late-spring regime. Since the shift identified in Period 11, the demand has averaged approximately 238 units (270 and 206). The current date is May 6th, which is typically a peak period for spring/summer fashion categories. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture the recent variability and the higher volume observed since the April/May transition, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to prioritize the most recent two high-volume samples (270 and 206). I will using recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility seen throughout the broader high-demand period that began in early April. Lead time is set to default (0).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (Womens Everyday denim) is currently in a high-demand period, though the most recent demand (Period 13: 145) shows a significant drop from the late-spring peak (Period 11: 270). Historical analysis shows three distinct regimes: Initial (avg ~67), Spring plateau (avg ~134), and Peak (avg ~210+). Last week's drop to 145 suggests the late-spring peak may be cooling down or stabilizing back toward the 200 level observed in April. The average demand across the current high regime (Periods 7-13) is roughly 207 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the backend will target a base stock to cover Period 14 demand. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the April-May regime (avg 207) while allowing the system to naturally start weighting down if the decline continues. Lead time remains at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak cooling: After a late-spring peak of 270 (Period 11), demand has dropped for two consecutive periods to 206 and 145, returning toward the April average of ~200.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (Womens Denim) is currently in Period 15 (late May). Recent demand history indicates a peak cooling off: Period 11 saw a peak of 270, followed by 206, 145, and now 189 in Period 14. This suggests demand is stabilizing or slightly declining from the spring peak. The average demand across the last 4 periods (P11-P14) is 202.5. Given the product category ('Womens Everyday Collection | 5-pocket jeans'), demand is likely to remain relatively steady through late spring/early summer rather than crashing, though the extreme peak is over. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this post-peak behavior for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level (1+L) * mu + z*sigma stays responsive to the recent stabilization around ~200 units per period while accounting for the high volatility observed during the shifts.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Demand stabilizing after spring peak (P11=270). Recent 4-period average is ~203 units. Trend shows a cooling from peak levels but remains higher than early spring plateaus (~134).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (Womens Denim) has moved past its late-spring peak (Period 11: 270 units) and is now stabilizing. Over the last four periods (P12-P15), demand has been 206, 145, 189, and 199, averaging 184.75 units. This is consistent with the 'Period 15' carry-over insight suggesting stabilization near the 200-unit mark. May 27th marks the transition toward early summer; historical denim demand often holds steady before any summer clearance or pre-fall shifts. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the post-peak average (~185 units per period), which helps prevent over-ordering as the spring peak subsides. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current volatility (std dev \u2248 27) of this stabilized regime, ensuring a safe buffer without excessive holding costs.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (Womens Everyday denim) is currently in Period 17 (early June). Demand in Period 16 was 237, which is a significant jump from the previous three weeks (145, 189, 199). This suggests that rather than a continuous decline from the late-spring peak (Period 11, demand 270), demand is stabilizing at a high level, likely influenced by early summer shopping. The last 5 periods show demand values of 206, 145, 189, 199, and 237, resulting in a mean of 195.2. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilization/potential secondary surge while filtering out the extremely high volatility of the April peaks. This set of parameters aims to rebuild inventory after the Period 16 stockout (sold 230 out of 237 demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand post-spring peak has stabilized in a 190-240 range (Period 12-16 average ~195), contradicting the previous cooling hypothesis. Early June (Period 16) saw demand rise back to 237.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (Luna skinny jeans) is currently in a June/summer demand regime. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P12-P17) shows demand fluctuating between 145 and 237, with an average of 193.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 31. This range reflects a stabilization after the late-April peak (P11). The most recent period (P17) saw demand of 187, slightly below the 6-period average. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current stabilized demand regime while acknowledging recent volatility, I will use a 6-period window (N=6) for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This window covers the period since the major volatility following the late-April peak and provides a stable basis for ordering. L remains 'default' (0) as all historical orders have arrived in the same period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday' skinny denim jean. Historical data and carry-over insights indicate a significant demand cycle: an early spring spike (late April, Period 11) followed by a stabilization period. Current date is June 17 (Period 19). Looking at demand from the last five periods (P14-P18: 189, 199, 237, 187, 141), the mean is 190.6 with a standard deviation of approximately 34.9. The most recent demand (141) suggests a possible downward trend into mid-summer, as denim demand often cools in hotter months. However, the average over the last 7 periods (since the late-spring peak at P11) is approximately 186. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for highly responsive ordering. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-peak trend (avg ~191) while maintaining a buffer for the volatility seen in June.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed in mid-June: Period 18 demand dropped to 141, the lowest since early May. The 5-period average (P14-P18) has settled at ~191 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4113.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (Womens Denim) is currently in a late-June period (2019/6/24). Recent demand shows significant volatility but generally remains within a high-activity regime. Demand in Period 19 rebounded to 218 after a dip to 141 in Period 18. The current 5-period average (P15-P19) is 196.4. While there were signs of cooling post-May peak, the demand has stabilized at a higher level than the early-year baseline. Since lead time is consistently 0, the target stock should be roughly equivalent to one period of demand. I will use a recent N=5 approach for mu_hat to capture the current stabilized mean of ~196 and recent_N=5 for \u03c3\u0302 to account for the heightened volatility observed in the last few weeks. This strategy ensures enough stock to meet demand spikes (like Period 19) while avoiding excessive holding costs given the zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-May peak has stabilized at a new plateau; the 5-period average (P15-P19) is ~196 units compared to the early June cooling estimate of ~191. Volatility remains high (141-237 range).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. In the previous period (June 24th), demand was 136, continuing a trend of high volatility but generally lower than the May peak. Historically, mid-summer (July) can see sustained but unpredictable demand for everyday staples like superstretch skinny jeans before the back-to-school surge. Since Period 15 (covering late May through June), demand has averaged approximately 184 units (199, 237, 187, 141, 218, 136). The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-peak stabilization level and its associated volatility. This period's starting on-hand inventory is 121, and there are no units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand plateau (late June/early July): Demand average has settled at approximately 184 units based on the last 6 periods, showing high weekly variance (136-237).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a staple item (Luna skinny jeans) currently in the mid-summer period (July). Recent demand history shows a downward trend after the spring peak: Period 20 demand was 136 and Period 21 was 118, marking the lowest demand levels since April. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P18-P21) is 153.25, significantly lower than the ~184-196 units observed in June. Given this cooling trend as we move further into summer (a typical low period for full-length heavy denim compared to spring/fall), I am reducing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this most recent cooling regime (153.25 units/period). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand cooling confirmed: Demand decreased for two consecutive periods (P20: 136, P21: 118), bringing the 4-period average to ~153 units, down from the June average of ~190+.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. This is mid-summer, a period where demand for '5-pocket jeans in washed, superstretch denim' is historically cooling off from the spring peak. Recent demand history confirms this: Period 20 (136), Period 21 (118), and Period 22 (90) show a clear downward trend. The 3-period average is ~115 units, down significantly from the ~184-190 plateau observed in June. The product is a staple (Womens Everyday Collection), but seasonal fluctuations are evident. Given the consistent sequence of declining demand, I will adjust the mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=4) to capture this cooling trend (average ~120-130). Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which simplifies inventory management. Using N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances the need to be responsive to the recent drop while maintaining enough buffer for the remaining volatility, as jeans still maintain baseline demand through summer.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand cooling period confirmed (July): Demand dropped for three consecutive periods (P20-22), from 136 to 90. The 3-period average is ~115 units, representing a significant reduction from the June average of ~190.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (skinny jeans) is in a mid-summer demand cooling phase. History shows a peak of 270 in late April (P11), stabilizing around 190-210 in June, and then dropping significantly in July. The last four periods (P20-P23) have seen demands of 136, 118, 90, and 128, respectively. The 4-period average is approx 118 units. While demand ticked up slightly in P23 (128) from P22 (90), the overall trend is a lower plateau compared to the spring/early summer season. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory during this lower demand phase, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this new July demand regime (~118 units), and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed for July: 4-period average (P20-P23) is ~118 units, down from the June average of ~190. Volatility has also decreased alongside the volume drop.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Luna skinny jeans has shifted from a high-spring peak (approx. 200+ units) to a lower, mid-summer plateau. Over the last five periods (P20-P24), demand has averaged 118.2 units (136, 118, 90, 128, 119), showing relative stabilization after the initial July drop. The date is July 29, 2019. We are likely nearing the end of the summer low and should prepare for potential 'Back-to-School' or autumn interest in denim, but for now, the 5-period average (N=5) accurately captures the current demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 0. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to align with this stabilized July volume while maintaining safety stock for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a mid-summer plateau in July (P20-P24) with an average of ~118 units, down from the June average of ~190. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. Inventory for this women's denim SKU has entered a stable mid-summer cooling phase which began in early July. Over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), demand has averaged approximately 110 units (136, 118, 90, 128, 119, 74), showing a downward trend compared to the June average of ~190. Period 25 saw the lowest demand in several months (74 units), suggesting the cooling is continuing or stabilizing at a lower base. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this lower July/August plateau. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect the reduced volatility observed during this period.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand cooling deepened in late July: 6-period average (P20-P25) is ~111 units, with Period 25 demand (74) being the lowest since early February. The SKU is currently in a low-demand stable regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-demand mid-summer plateau. Demand has significantly decreased from the June average of ~190 to a recent average of ~91 units over the last 5 periods (P22-P26: 90, 128, 119, 74, 56). The most recent two periods (74 and 56) suggest a continued cooling trend as August begins. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this shift towards lower demand and volatility, while maintaining the stable lead time of 0. This approach balances the need to reduce ending inventory (currently 95 units, which exceeds the most recent demand) with the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend continued into early August: 2-period average (P25-P26) is 65 units, compared to the July average of ~118. Demand has now returned to levels similar to the initial Jan/Feb baseline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's denim) is currently in a low-demand late-summer regime. Demand has stabilized at a level consistent with the initial January/February baseline. The last three periods (P25-P27) show demand of 74, 56, and 71, respectively, giving a 3-period average of ~67 units. This confirms a significant cooling from the mid-summer plateau (~118) and the spring peak (>200). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Based on this sustained shift back to baseline levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to avoid over-ordering during this low-demand phase while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the immediate period's expected demand plus a safety stock adjusted for the current variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed back to baseline (Period 25-27): Avg demand of ~67 units is consistent with the initial Jan/Feb levels, marking the end of the summer cooling trend.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 562245050 (Womens Denim) has returned from its spring/summer peak to its initial Jan/Feb baseline of approximately 65-70 units per period. The last four periods (P25-P28) show demand values of 74, 56, 71, and 73, yielding a mean of 68.5. This aligns with the 'carry_over_insight' that the summer cooling trend has concluded, returning to the baseline. For Period 29 (late August), I am anticipating demand to stay within this baseline regime but also watching for a potential early-fall uptick. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this stable baseline while allowing for quick responsiveness if the next season begins. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods provides the best balance between current stability and potential upcoming seasonal shifts.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (women's skinny jeans) has returned to its baseline demand regime (late August/early September). In the last five periods (P25-P29), demand has been 74, 56, 71, 73, and 63, averaging ~67.4 units per period. This perfectly aligns with the Jan/Feb baseline identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 0 periods. Since we are entering September, there is a potential for a 'Back to School' or Autumn ramp-up, but current data does not yet show a significant shift from the 67-unit baseline. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable low-demand environment (post-summer cooling) while remaining responsive to any early September increases. The on-hand inventory is currently low (20), necessitating an order to maintain the base stock level.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable low-demand regime, returning to the baseline levels observed at the start of the year (Jan/Feb). Recent demand samples for Periods 25-30 are: 74, 56, 71, 73, 63, 70. Moving into early September (9/9), we are exiting the late summer cooling period. While denim often sees a 'Back to School' or autumn uptick, there is no significant evidence of this shift in the data yet (last 3 periods average ~68.7). I will set N=6 for mu_hat to capture this recent stable baseline (average ~67.8), and use N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect the current low volatility. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which will be maintained.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable at the initial Jan/Feb baseline of ~68 units through early September (P25-P30 average: 67.8). No early autumn uptick detected yet.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245050' (Women's Skinny Jeans) has returned to its baseline demand regime. From Period 26 through Period 31 (late August to early September), demand has consistently averaged approximately 64 units per period (individual values: 56, 71, 73, 63, 70, 52). This aligns with the initial year-start baseline observations and is significantly lower than the spring/early summer peaks. Current inventory is 28 units. Given the transition into mid-September (2019/9/16), we remain in a stable period before any typical late-autumn or holiday uptick. I will use a recent_N method with N=7 to capture this current stable baseline (Periods 25-31) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for this SKU (women's superstretch denim) has been stable at a baseline level since early August (Period 26). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P25-P32) is approximately 63.5 units (74, 56, 71, 73, 63, 70, 52, 47), which is very close to the initial Jan/Feb baseline of 67. The most recent two periods (52 and 47) show a slight softening, but not enough to confirm a new regime shift. Lead time of 0 is consistently observed. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this established stability and maintain service levels while avoiding excess inventory, as we are currently in a low-demand phase following the spring/summer peaks.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Skinny Jeans) is currently in a stable demand regime consistent with the initial early-year baseline. Since Period 25 (late July), demand has averaged approximately 65.5 units per period (P25-P33 range: 47-74). There is no evidence yet of an autumn/winter uptick, despite being at the end of September. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Based on the current low-demand plateau that has sustained for 9 periods, I will use a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this baseline regime while ignoring the high-voulme spring/summer peaks. On-hand inventory is low (12), so the backend will order to refill the base stock for the current period's expected demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for this SKU (women's jeans) has been extremely stable since late August (Period 27/28), reverting to the initial baseline level of approximately 65-70 units per period. The last 7 periods (P28-P34) have had demands of 73, 63, 70, 52, 47, 69, 47, respectively, resulting in a mean of 60.1 and a standard deviation of 11.2. Although fall seasonality often brings an uptick for denim, Oct 7 (early October) hasn't shown a significant increase yet in the historical samples or recent history. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current stable baseline regime, ensuring we don't overstock based on the much higher spring/summer volumes while maintaining enough buffer for the observed weekly volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable at the baseline regime through early October (P28-P34 average: 60.1 units). No autumn seasonal uptick detected as of Oct 7.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 562245050 (Womens Everyday Jeans) is currently in a stable low-demand regime, consistent with the initial baseline observed in Jan/Feb. The last 11 periods (P25-P35) have seen an average demand of approximately 62 units, with a further slight softening in the most recent period (P35: 31 units). While we are in mid-October, no autumn seasonal uptick has materialized yet. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N (N=8) to capture this stable baseline (averaging ~63 units) while ignoring the highly volatile spring/summer peaks. This provides a balance between meeting the current low demand and minimizing holding costs, as the profit/holding cost ratio is high ($19 vs $1), favoring a slightly higher service level.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for this SKU has been in a sustained low-demand stable regime since Period 25 (late July), with demand levels consistently mirroring the initial January/February baseline of ~60-70 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P32-P36) show an average demand of 46.8 units, while the last 10 periods (P27-P36) average 56.3 units. There is no evidence of an autumn seasonal uptick as of yet. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this low-demand phase while maintaining a sufficient service level for the $19 profit margin, I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current baseline regime while discarding the higher spring/summer volatility. This N provides a balance between responsiveness to the current low levels and enough samples to estimate variance correctly.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (everyday skinny jeans) is currently in a stable low-demand regime that has persisted since late August (approx. Period 28). Recent demand samples (P33-P37: 69, 47, 31, 40, 42) show a 5-period average of 45.8 units, which is lower than the previous baseline of ~60. Analysis of the last 10 periods (P28-P37) shows an average demand of 50.4 units with relatively low volatility. There is no evidence of an autumn seasonal uptick as of October 28. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this established lower-demand baseline accurately while ignoring the higher volatility of the mid-summer peak. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a lower baseline in October: 5-period average (P33-P37) is ~46 units, compared to the Sept/Oct average of ~60. This reflects a sustained late-autumn cooling for this SKU.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (women's skinny jeans) is currently in a late-autumn low-demand regime. Demand has stabilized at a lower baseline than the summer cooling period. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38: 47, 31, 40, 42, 39) is approximately 39.8 units. This represents a sustained decrease from the September average of ~60. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using recent_N where N=5 to capture this most recent stable low-demand window (late October), allowing the OR backend to minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for high-margin ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) but low-volume sales. No early winter or holiday uptick is yet evident in the data.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this SKU (women's skinny jeans) has reached a low, stable baseline following a series of cooling trends throughout autumn. The most recent demand regime, spanning the last 7 periods (P33-P39), shows an average of 42.1 units per period (47, 31, 40, 42, 39, 46). This is significantly lower than the early October baseline of ~60. Currently, on-hand inventory is 4 units, and in-transit is 0. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. Setting mu_hat to capture this recent low-demand regime using recent_N (N=7) ensures we don't over-order based on previous higher-demand periods. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to reflect current lower volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Luna skinny RW' denim SKU has shown distinct seasonal shifts: a major peak in late spring (May), a cooling in July, and a return to base levels in August/September. Period 38 identified a further cooling in October to an average of ~46 units. However, demand in the last two periods (P39: 46, P40: 59) shows a slight upward tick, likely due to the approached holiday season (pre-Black Friday/pre-Christmas). The current 3-period average (P38-P40) is ~48 units. Given that late November often sees increased retail activity, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture this recent slight uptick while remaining cautious of overstocking before confirmed holiday spikes. Measured lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand shows signs of stabilization or slight increase in mid-November (avg ~48 units last 3 periods) following the late-autumn cooling, potentially signaling early holiday season effects.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is the start of the Black Friday/holiday shopping week. Historically, this SKU (Womens Everyday Jeans) has shown significant demand spikes during seasonal transitions. While demand in Period 41 was low (26), the preceding weeks (P39-P40) showed a stabilization around 50 units. However, looking at the lead-up to the December period and the nature of the product, an increase in demand is expected due to holiday promotions. To prepare for this, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent average (~44 units), but I will monitor for a holiday surge in the next period. Lead time remains stable at 0. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility seen in the last few weeks (range 26-59).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Potential holiday seasonal shift. While mid-November demand was stable at ~48, late November/early December is likely to see an uptick for everyday denim items.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand spiked significantly to 130 units, up from a recent 5-period average (P37-P41) of ~42 units. This confirms the anticipated holiday seasonal shift for this 'Everyday Collection' denim SKU, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (late November). The previous baseline of ~46-60 units is no longer relevant. With an on-hand inventory of 0 and a lead time of 0, I must set parameters to immediately capture this higher demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the sudden upward trend while acknowledging the volatility of the spike, and set sigma_hat to 'explicit' at 40 to account for the high variance observed during such promotional peaks, ensuring the base stock level is high enough to avoid stockouts during this critical sales window.

Carry-over insight: Holiday seasonal spike confirmed at Period 42: Demand increased to 130 (+200% over the late-autumn average of ~42) coinciding with late-November retail events. High volatility expected to continue through December.

LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), demand dropped to 30 following a Period 42 spike of 130. This volatility is characteristic of the holiday season for a women's denim SKU, where large promotional spikes are often followed by brief pullbacks before subsequent holiday peaks. The 2-period average for the early December period is 80 units ((130+30)/2). Given the upcoming peak holiday shopping weeks in mid-to-late December (Periods 44-46), I will set mu_hat based on this recent average to capture the elevated holiday baseline while accounting for the high volatility observed. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat target this specific holiday regime.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season high volatility confirmed: Demand shows wide swings (130 to 30) in late Nov/early Dec. Recent 2-period average (P42-P43) is 80 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16, mid-December holiday season. Demand in the last three periods has been 130, 30, and 37, indicating extreme volatility common during retail holiday events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday vs. mid-December lull). Period 42 showed a massive spike (130), while Period 43 and 44 cooled significantly. However, the week before Christmas often sees another surge for apparel/gifts. Average demand over these three volatile periods is 65.6 units. Given the seasonality of 'Womens Everyday' denim, I need to account for both the recent lower demand and the potential for a pre-holiday finish. Lead time remains stable at 0. mu_hat will use the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the high-volatility holiday window, which balances the 130 spike with the recent 30s. sigma_hat will also use N=3 to capture this high variance, ensuring the backend maintains enough safety stock for another potential surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season volatility confirmed: Demand fluctuates heavily (130, 30, 37) in late Nov/early Dec. 3-period average is ~66 units with very high standard deviation.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the late December holiday period (Dec 23). Historical demand for the last three periods (P43-P45) has been low and stable around ~34 units (30, 37, 36), following a significant one-off spike of 130 in P42 (late November). This suggests the peak holiday demand for this 'Everyday Collection' denim item has passed, or demand is currently suppressed as shoppers transition to post-Christmas behavior. The carry-over insights noted high volatility, which is evident in the drop from 130 to the 30s. Given the date (Dec 23), we expect demand to remain at these moderate levels or potentially decrease further as the holiday shopping window closes. Lead time remains consistently at 0. With 124 units on-hand and an average demand of ~34 units over the last 3 periods, we have sufficient safety stock. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-spike stabilization while ignoring the P42 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling confirmed (Dec 2-Dec 16): Demand has stabilized at an average of ~34 units for 3 consecutive periods (P43, P44, P45) following the late-November spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, following the year-end holiday period. Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim SKU has significantly declined post-holiday, with the last four periods showing demand of 30, 37, 36, and 19 units. This averages to approximately 30.5 units, which is lower than the previous late-autumn baseline of ~46. Given the current period is the transition into January, I anticipate demand will remain low, consistent with post-holiday cooling and previous year-to-date historical performance (Jan 2019 samples averaged ~67). I will use a restricted window (recent_N=4) to capture this immediate low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, allowing for 'calculate' to be used. Inventory is currently high (105 units) relative to recent demand (19), so the OR backend will naturally suppress ordering until the surplus is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand collapse (Late Dec): Demand dropped significantly from the holiday volatility to an average of ~30.5 units over the last 4 periods (P43-P46).
