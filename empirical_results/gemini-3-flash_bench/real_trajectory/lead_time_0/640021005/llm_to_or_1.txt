Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1: Initial decision phase for SKU 640021005 (Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS). Current date is 2019-02-11. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a rising trend (6, 4, 20, 14, 18), averaging 12.4. However, the last 3 weeks (20, 14, 18) show a significantly higher mean (17.3) compared to the first 2 weeks. As this is a 'Divided Collection' denim item, we might be entering a spring demand phase. Promised lead time is 0. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period regime to capture the recent volume increase. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a sufficient safety buffer given the high volatility (std ~6.47) and equal profit/holding cost ($1.0), implying a 50% service level target for the base stock calculation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the history, in Period 1 (2019/2/11), we ordered 18 units with an observed lead time of 0. Demand for that period was 24, resulting in a stockout (sold 18, ending inventory 0). The item is 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS', a pair of jeans from the Divided Collection. Historical demand samples (6, 4, 20, 14, 18) show an upward trend, peaking at 20 then settling at 18 just before the game start. Period 1's realized demand of 24 suggests a further increase, likely due to spring seasonality for denim and tapered legs. Since we are currently out of stock (on-hand 0), and L=0, we need to set parameters to capture this higher demand regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (averaging the last three known demand points: 14, 18, 24) to adjust to the higher mean, and explicit sigma to handle the volatility shown in the jump from 18 to 24.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, and we are managing a pair of 5-pocket jeans. In the first two periods (Feb 11th and Feb 18th), demand was 24 and 29 units respectively, both of which exceeded our initial stock levels and orders, resulting in stockouts (sold out all on-hand inventory). The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical data shows demand rising toward the end of January/beginning of February (14, 18, and now 24, 29). To prevent further lost sales, I am increasing the demand forecast. Since the last 3-4 data points show a clear upward trend compared to the early January mean, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this recent increase in demand while maintaining the observed lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS) is experiencing a massive demand surge. Historical demand from early January to early February averaged ~12 units/period. However, in Period 3 (2019/2/25), demand spiked significantly to 95 units, likely driven by the transition into Spring fashion and the 'Divided' collection's trendiness. Total sales have been limited by inventory (on-hand 0 at start of demand phase), as we have been stocking out every period despite Lead Time = 0. We need to aggressively increase the base stock. The mean demand over the last 3 observed periods (24, 29, 95) is 49.3 units, but the median is lower and the 95 is an outlier. Given the stockouts, actual demand is likely higher than sales. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the upward trend but remain slightly conservative against the massive spike to avoid excessive holding costs if P3 was a one-time peak, while increasing sigma_hat to account for the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 3: Demand increased from an average of ~12 (pre-game) to 95 (+690%). High stockout risk; inventory consistently depleted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS', a style of high-waist denim trousers. Historical demand data from early 2019 showed an average of ~12 units, but since Period 3 (late February), demand has spiked dramatically: 95 in P3 and 174 in P4. We have been stocking out completely every period (sold = arrived, ending on-hand = 0), indicating significant unmet demand. The OR backend's order cap logic is currently restricting our ability to catch up because it relies on historical demand statistics that are lagging behind this shift. To address this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat based on the most recent demand (174) and anticipating some further growth as we enter the spring fashion season. Since lead time has consistently been 0, L is set to 0. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) allows the volatility calculation to focus on the high-demand periods (P2-P4) rather than the low-demand pre-game data, widening the safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Period 4 demand reached 174 units, a 1450% increase over pre-game levels and an 83% increase over Period 3, confirming a sharp seasonal upward trend for Spring denim.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '640021005' (Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS) is experiencing an aggressive upward trend as spring fashion ramps up in mid-March. Demand has surged from 95 (P3) to 174 (P4) and now 254 (P5). Despite increasing order quantities, inventory has been exhausted every period from P1 to P5, meaning the actual demand is likely even higher than recorded sales. Since lead time is consistently 0, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for the upcoming week based on the current growth trajectory. mu_hat needs to be set high enough to capture this peak, and sigma_hat must account for the high volatility shown during this regime shift. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to weigh the high-demand periods (P3-P5) heavily while acknowledging the explosive growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 5 demand (254) represents a 46% increase over Period 4 (174) and is ~20x the pre-game seasonal average. Total stockouts in every period (P1-P5) indicate latent demand is likely exceeding captured sales figures.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' is in a high-growth seasonal phase for Spring (late March). Historical demand has spiked from ~20 to 254 in Period 5, then eased slightly to 173 in Period 6. Since we have had total stockouts from Periods 1-5, the demand of 173 in Period 6 is our first 'clean' look at unconstrained demand, although even that was nearly a stockout (ending inventory 2). Given the extreme volatility and the clear upward trend compared to pre-game levels, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the high-regime average (95+174+254+173 / 4 is roughly 174). I'll use N=3 to weight the most recent peak more heavily. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently confirmed by 'conclude' messages. I'm using explicit sigma_hat to account for the high forecast uncertainty during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued in Period 6 (173) after a peak in Period 5 (254), but remains significantly elevated (+10x) above pre-February levels. This confirms a volatile Spring peak regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $201.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of April 1st (Period 8), the demand for this 'Divided Collection' denim SKU remains in a high-demand Spring regime. Historical demand since Period 3 has been 95, 174, 254, 173, and 243. The stockouts in nearly every period (current on-hand is 0) indicate that the true demand potential is likely higher than current sales. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To capture this high but volatile demand, mu_hat will be set using a recent N=5 (covering the regime shift since P3) to reflect the current mean demand of ~188 units. This ensures the OR engine calculation (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) targets the recent average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility seen during this peak period, ensuring the service level is high enough to minimize lost sales in a profit=holding_cost (1:1) scenario (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Strong Spring demand sustained into April. High captured demand of 243 in P7 confirms that demand is consistently exceeding 170 units, despite the P6 plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' has exploded unexpectedly as we enter April. Period 8 demand reached 578 units, a massive increase from the previous peak of 254 (Period 5) and the 170-240 range seen in Periods 6-7. This suggests a massive April seasonal peak for distressed denim. Since lead time is consistently 0 (arrived in the same period), I must aggressively set mu_hat to match this new demand floor to avoid massive lost sales, even though on-hand inventory is currently zero. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to aim for 600 units (accounting for the 578 observed in the most recent period) and set sigma_hat explicitly high to handle the extreme volatility seen in the last three weeks (173, 243, 578).

Carry-over insight: Massive demand spike confirmed in Early April: Period 8 demand (578) is +234% of the previous plateau (avg 196 in P6-7), marking a new ultra-high demand regime for Spring.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. We are in the peak of the Spring denim season for this item (Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS). Historical data shows a massive demand spike in Period 8 (578 units) followed by a moderation to 216 units in Period 9. The 'Carry-Over Insights' confirm a regime shift occurred in Early April. While Period 9 demand (216) was lower than Period 8, it remains significantly above the March average (approx. 190). Our on-hand inventory is currently 384 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand, but we must protect against the volatility seen in Period 8. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 (covering Periods 7, 8, and 9) to capture the current high-demand volatile regime (average ~345 units per period). This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the recent spike and the subsequent moderation, ensuring we have enough stock if demand surges again while acknowledging the existing 384 units on hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-18.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for item 640021005 (high-waisted denim) shows a period of extreme volatility. Following a massive spike to 578 units in Period 8 (early April), demand has settled back to a more sustainable level in Period 9 (216) and Period 10 (183). This average of ~200 units over the last two periods is consistent with the late March regime (which averaged ~208 units in P6-7) before the outlier spike. With 201 units currently on hand and no items in transit, and assuming the promised lead time of 0 remains reliable (confirmed by 9 consecutive arrivals), I am setting mu_hat to 200 using the 'explicit' method. This targets a 1:1 service level vs. holding cost (since profit and holding cost both equal $1), positioning the base stock to cover expected demand without over-ordering after the P8 surge. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 30 to account for some variability around this new baseline while avoiding the excessive variance caused by the P8 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized after early April spike: Period 9-10 average is 199.5 units, returning to late March levels. Spring denim peak appears to have peaked and is now in a steady-state around 200 units/period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' (a Spring-seasonal item) peaked in early April (P8 demand of 578) and has since significantly decelerated. Demand over the last three periods (P9: 216, P10: 183, P11: 138) shows a clear downward trend from the early April highs, dropping an average of ~20% per period recently. Starting on-hand inventory is 63. No units are in transit. Cumulative lead time observations (P1-P9) consistently show a lead time of 0 periods. To prevent building excess inventory for a product that has passed its seasonal peak (early April), I am using a recent_N strategy for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the cooling demand regime (average ~179). For sigma_hat, I am using a smaller recent_N (N=4) to account for the volatility seen through the peak and subsequent decline, ensuring the base stock level reflects current risk without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand for Spring denim peaked in early April (Period 8) and is now trending downward: Period 9-11 demand shows a consistent decline (216 -> 183 -> 138).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Spring denim) has passed its absolute peak in early April (Period 8, demand 578) and has entered a late-season stabilization/decline phase. Recent demand figures for Periods 9-12 are 216, 183, 138, and 162. While Period 12 saw a small uptick to 162, the overall trend since mid-April is significantly lower than the late March/early April peak. The average demand over the last four periods (P9-P12) is 174.75. Given the dates (now early May), we expect Spring denim to continue a gradual tapering as the season transitions toward Summer styles. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game. With a Profit-to-Holding ratio of 1:1, the OR backend aims for a 50% service level. To prevent overstocking during this downward trend while maintaining enough stock for the current 160-170 range, I will use a recent window of N=4 to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history (which includes the massive outlier in P8). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently verified by the 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization confirmed: Since Period 9 (April 8th), demand has averaged ~175 units, down from the peak volatility of March/Early April. The Spring denim season is now trending toward a gradual decline/stabilization as May begins.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Analyzing the demand history for this 'Spring Denim' SKU (640021005), we observe that the peak occurred in early April (Period 8, demand 578) and has since stabilized downward. The last five periods (P9-P13) show demand values of 216, 183, 138, 162, and 127. The average demand over these last 5 periods is 165.2 units. The lead time has consistently behaved as 0 periods. Since the Spring season is winding down and the current OH is 48, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (representing the post-peak stabilization regime) to ensure we don't over-order as the product likely enters a late-season decline. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the current volatility rather than the extreme spikes of March/April.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' is clearly in a post-peak decline phase as we move into late May (Date: 2019/5/20). After the early April peak of 578 units (Period 8), demand has consistently lowered. Recent demand observations for Periods 11-14 are 138, 162, 127, and 117. The 3-period average (P12-14) is 135 units, while the most recent reading is 117. Given the 'Divided' collection's high-fashion, high-turnover nature and the arrival of warmer late-spring weather, consumers are likely shifting away from heavy denim towards lighter garments. The on-hand inventory is 49 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory as the season winds down, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower-demand regime (averaging ~136 units) while accounting for the recent deceleration. This provides a buffer against the high volatility seen in the preceding weeks while aligning with the downward seasonal trend.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak decline confirmed: Demand for Spring denim has dropped significantly from the April peak, with the last 4 periods average (~136 units) representing a 30% decrease from the late-April stabilization levels (~190).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), we observed a massive unexpected demand spike in Period 15 (281 units), which is more than double the average of the preceding four periods (~136). This spike is likely driven by late-May Memorial Day shopping or a final surge in spring fashion interest. Our inventory was completely depleted (ending on-hand: 0). Given this volatility, I am shifting from a 'post-peak decline' mindset back to a conservative high-demand holding pattern. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent activity (average ~166) while using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the massive standard deviation caused by the P15 outlier (which jump-started volatility from ~20 to ~70+). The L parameter remains at 0 based on consistent historical arrival performance.

Carry-over insight: Sudden demand surge in Period 15 (281 units) invalidates the 'post-peak decline' stabilizing trend; indicates potential Memorial Day or pre-summer volatility for denim.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Divided Denim Trousers) is exhibiting high demand volatility at the start of June. Period 15 saw a major spike (281 units, likely pre-Memorial Day), while Period 16 dropped to 131 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-16) is 163.8 units. Although Period 16 showed a decline, the start of June often correlates with summer denim demand. Given Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current post-peak volatility without being overly reactive to the single Period 15 spike or the Period 16 drop, balancing the stock against the current June demand regime.

Carry-over insight: June demand remains volatile following a late-May spike; Period 15-16 average (206 units) is significantly higher than the mid-May average (122 units), indicating a potential early-summer surge.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand for this high-waisted denim SKU showed a massive peak in April (Period 8: 578 units), followed by a stabilization around 130-180 units. A sudden surge in Period 15 (May 20, 281 units) likely corresponded to Memorial Day promotions or clinical summer shopping, but demand has since returned to a more stable range (Period 16: 131 units, Period 17: 125 units). Despite the Carry-over insight for Period 17 suggesting early-summer surge volatility, the last two concluded periods (16 and 17) show demand returning to the post-peak mean. To balance the risk of stockouts against the high holding costs ($1/unit), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the environment since the mid-May dip/surge, which averages approximately 150 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '640021005' (Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS) is experiencing post-peak seasonal volatility. After a significant demand surge in Period 15 (281 units) likely linked to Memorial Day, demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P16-P18) to an average of 117.33 units (131, 125, 96). With the current date of June 17th, we are moving into the mid-summer season where demand for high-waisted heavy denim typically softens compared to the Spring peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is 62 units. To prevent overstocking while maintaining service levels for the lingering summer demand, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period regime (N=3) which reflects the current post-Memorial Day stabilization. This targets a base stock level around the current average demand plus a safety margin to account for volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Divided Collection denim) is currently in Period 20 (late June). Recent demand history shows significant volatility: Period 17 (125), Period 18 (96), and Period 19 (142). Although a summer surge was anticipated, the actual demand remains lower than the April peak but consistently fluctuates around a mean of ~120-130. We ended Period 19 with 0 on-hand inventory due to stockouts, indicating our orders were insufficient to capture the full Period 19 demand. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To stabilize service levels while accounting for the recent erratic demand (low of 96, high of 142), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand trend (avg ~121) and a similar recent_N approach for sigma_hat to reflect the current variability. Since we are out of stock and L=0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover the upcoming period's demand effectively.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. This is typically a stable period for summer denim before the 'Back to School' ramp-up. Examining recent demand (P16-P20): 131, 125, 96, 142, 102. The average for these last 5 periods is 119.2. Previous volatility in late May (P15: 281) appears to have settled into a lower-volume summer regime. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. The Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying an optimal service level (q) of 0.5, where base stock should target the median demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this summer stabilization and prevent over-ordering based on the April/May peaks, while maintaining enough stock to cover the recent average demand of approximately 120 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P16-P20): Demand has stabilized at a lower level with a 5-period average of ~119 units, down significantly from the volatile Spring peaks.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is hard-worn denim jeans, which are typically a year-round staple but showed significant Spring volatility. Since Period 16 (late May through June), demand has settled into a 'summer regime'. Looking at Periods 16-21, the demands were 131, 125, 96, 142, 102, 145. The average demand for these last 6 periods is approximately 123.5 units. Period 21 ended with 0 inventory, indicating we are still slightly under-ordering during small peaks. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized summer regime and ensure sufficient stock for the mid-July period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late July (Period 23), following a relatively stable early summer period. Recent demand has shown a slight uptick (Period 21: 145, Period 22: 152), which is higher than the early June/late June average of ~114 (P17-P20). This suggests a potential minor mid-summer surge or inventory-constrained demand recovery. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. To address the current demand level which is trending back above 140 units, I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, for mu_hat, I'll use N=7 (covering back to Period 16), which captures the transition from late June into July, averaging approximately 135 units per period. For sigma_hat, I will use N=7 as well to capture recent volatility. Given Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the backend service level target is 50%; however, the capped policy ensures we don't over-order against seasonality. Starting on-hand is 0, so an order for the full base stock minus pipeline will be triggered.

Carry-over insight: July demand uptick detected: Average demand increased from ~114 (P17-P20) to ~148 (P21-P22), suggesting a mid-summer shifts in denim interest.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '640021005' is currently in a mid-summer demand regime. Analysis of the last 3 periods (P21-P23) shows demand values of 145, 152, and 177, yielding an average of 158 units. This is a clear upward shift from the early summer average (~114). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with actual delivery observations. Given the profit ($1.0) is equal to the holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the base stock toward the median of the demand distribution. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent upward trend in July, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current volatility within this shift. L is set to 'default' as actual lead time matches promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime shift confirmed: average demand increased from ~114 (P17-P20) to ~158 (P21-P23) (+38%), indicating a sustained late-summer interest spike in denim.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS) is currently in a late-July/early-August demand phase. After a recent demand uptick (Period 21-23 average ~158), Period 24 saw a drop to 104 units, resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 54. This suggests the recent mid-summer surge may be cooling off or exhibiting volatility as we transition toward August. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high stockout frequency in previous periods when demand spiked (P21, P22, P23), but a surplus in P24, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current regime average (approx 145 units), which balances the recent high demand with the P24 dip. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility seen in the last month (range: 104 to 177).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Perrie Trash HW Denim) is currently in a sustained late-summer demand regime. The most recent demand samples are Period 21: 145, Period 22: 152, Period 23: 177, Period 24: 104, and Period 25: 161. Over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), the average demand is 147.8 units, which is a significant increase from the previous summer plateau (~114). Although Period 24 saw a dip to 104, Period 25's demand of 161 confirms the higher level observed in Periods 21-23. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To capture this recent shift and protect against the volatility shown in P23 and P25, I will use a recent_N strategy for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the late-summer surge) and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the current demand variance. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the latest local mean and volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Divided Collection Denim) is currently in an August late-summer demand surge. In the last 6 periods (P21-P26), demand has averaged 155.6 units, significantly higher than the previous early-summer plateau of ~119 units. The most recent demand (P26) was 195, suggesting an upward trend likely related to back-to-school or late-summer fashion resets. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stockouts in P25 and P26, where demand exceeded our orders. To capture this higher demand level and prevent further stockouts, I will use a 6-period recent_N window (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the current higher-demand regime while smoothing out weekly volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: August demand surge confirmed: P21-P26 average demand is ~156 units, compared to ~119 units in P16-P20 (+31%), indicating a sustained late-summer/back-to-school upward shift.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. This SKU (640021005, High-Waist Denim) has entered a late-summer/back-to-school demand surge. Looking at the last 7 periods (P21-P27), demand has consistently averaged ~160 units (145, 152, 177, 104, 161, 195, 190), which is a clear step up from the ~115 average seen in early summer. Specifically, the last three periods (P25-P27) show a higher average of 182 units, with several stockouts occurring because starting inventory was capped by the backend logic or insufficient ordering. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the OR engine balances stockout risk and holding cost equally. Given the lead time remains consistently 0, I will use recent_N to capture this late-summer upward trend. N=7 covers the entire shift from the July uptick to the current August peak, providing a stable but responsive forecast for the back-to-school window.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, late summer heading into the back-to-school season. Demand analysis: P26 (195), P27 (190), and P28 (155) show a sustained elevated regime compared to the early summer average (~119). The 8-period average since the mid-July uptick (P21-P28) is ~160 units. While P28 showed a slight dip to 155, demand remains strong. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game history, and with the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making the base stock equal to the mean. To capture the recent late-summer surge while acknowledging the slight P28 cooldown, I will use a recent_N of 6 periods for mu_hat (averaging ~163 units) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Historical data confirms a sustained upward shift in demand during August, likely driven by 'Back-to-School' shopping and late-summer interest in denim. Over the last 9 periods (P21-P29), demand has averaged approximately 156 units. While demand in the most recent two periods (P28-P29) dipped slightly (155, 126), the broader August regime (P25-P27) was much stronger (161, 195, 190). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts seen in late August against the potential for an early September cooldown, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the full late-summer regime average (~156 per period). With a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the base stock policy targets a 50% service level, but the OR backend's safety stock logic (z-score) will provide additional buffer against the volatility observed in this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School/Late Summer demand regime (August) confirmed: Avg demand for Period 21-29 is ~156 units, compared to ~119 in the mid-summer period (P16-P20).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9th, transitioning from the back-to-school season into early autumn. Demand in Period 30 was 159, confirming the sustained demand regime observed since Period 21. For the period P21-P30, the average demand is 156.5 units. While there was a slight dip in late August (P29 demand: 126), the stockout in P30 suggests that the underlying demand remains strong and likely exceeds the units sold. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a sufficient service level given the high stockout frequency (P25-P27, P30), I am setting mu_hat using the recent 10-period average (P21-P30) to capture the current late-summer/early-fall level and using a 10-period window for sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility in this regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in a post-Back-to-School phase for the 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS'. Historical analysis shows a demand regime that stabilized in late summer (P21-P31) with an average of approximately 154 units per period. The most recent demand (P31: 131 units) and the end of the August/early September peak suggests a slight cooling, but demand remains robust compared to mid-summer levels. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering the stabilization period from P21 to P31) to capture the current late-summer/early-autumn regime while smoothing out weekly volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the proven ~150 unit demand level to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs as seasonality begins to transition into late September.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, trailing the Back-to-School season. Observed demand has remained remarkably stable over the last 12 periods (P21-P32), with a mean of ~148 units and a standard deviation of ~28. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P29-P32) demand figures were 126, 159, 131, and 137, showing a slight cooling from the August peak but no significant drop-off. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is low (18 units) and the product is a staple (tapered high-waist denim), I will use a 12-period window (N=12) to capture the stable late-summer/early-fall regime while smoothing out the minor weekly fluctuations. This ensures the base stock calculation properly covers the current ~148 unit average demand with an appropriate safety buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn demand stability: Since Period 21, demand has stabilized into a consistent regime averaging ~148 units, following the late-summer surge.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS) is currently in a stable Autumn regime. Since Period 21 (early July), despite some early August 'back-to-school' volatility, the demand has stabilized. The average demand over the last 13 periods (P21-P33) is approximately 151 units per period. The last 4 periods average 151 units (159, 131, 137, 177). Inventory depleted in Period 33 due to a demand spike (177), leaving 0 on-hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (which equal profit), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 13-period regime to capture the current stable mean, and sigma_hat based on the same window to account for the fluctuations observed in August and late September.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. We are in a stable demand regime that has persisted since approximately late July (Period 24). Analyzing the demand from Period 24 to Period 34, the average demand is approximately 144 units per period (104, 161, 195, 190, 155, 126, 159, 131, 137, 177, 97). Although Period 34 saw a lower demand of 97, this is within a reasonable range of volatility for this SKU. The lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they are placed. To maintain the target service level given that Profit equals Holding Cost (q = 0.5, implying the base stock should target the median demand), and accounting for the 0-period lead time, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent stable regime (N=11, from P24 to P34). This balances the need to cover expected demand without accruing excessive holding costs for this high-waisted denim SKU.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stability: Since Period 24 (late July), demand has entered a consistent regime averaging ~144 units (N=11).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. We are moving further into the Autumn season for 'Perrie Trash HW Denim' (extra-high waist 5-pocket jeans). Historically, this item has seen high demand in Spring and late Summer (back-to-school), but recent data (last 2 periods) shows a noticeable decline: Period 34 demand was 97 (down from 177) and Period 35 demand was 72. This suggests a seasonal cooldown as we transition into mid-October. The 11-period average recorded in the carry-over insight was ~144, but the average of the last 4 periods (P32-P35) is 120, and the last 2 is only 84.5. Given the high stockout risk seen throughout the year, I will use a conservative adjustment rather than a sharp cut, setting mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (avg = 113) to account for the most recent downward trend while maintaining safety stock. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Autumn demand decline: Period 34-35 show a significant drop (avg 84.5) compared to the Autumn steady-state of ~144 units, indicating the end of the steady-state regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' is currently in a steady decline as the Autumn season progresses. Since the peak of late summer/back-to-school (P21-P33 avg ~150), demand has dropped significantly. The last three periods (P34-P36) have recorded demands of 97, 72, and 53, respectively. This downward trend is consistent with a seasonal shift away from lightweight or specific summer/autumn denim styles in late October. Consequently, I am using a recent_N window of 3 to capture this immediate downward regime shift and lower the inventory target to avoid excessive holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 70 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Autumn demand decline confirmed: Demand has shifted from a stable ~144 units (P24-P33) to a declining trend (P34-P36: 97, 72, 53), averaging ~74 units over the last 3 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for 'Perrie Trash HW Denim' has confirmed a downward seasonal trend since the start of October (Period 34). The last four demand samples are 97, 72, 53, and 79. While there was a slight increase in Period 37, the average over the last four periods is ~75 units, significantly down from the Autumn average of ~144 units. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this new lower-demand regime. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history, so I am using the default method for L. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio is 0.5; under a normal distribution, the base stock should approximately equal the expected demand over the lead time plus one period (L+1). By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that aligns with this current lower demand level while protecting against the observed volatility (sigma).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a confirmed late-autumn decline for this SKU ('Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS'). Demand has significantly dropped from the autumn steady-state (~144 units) to a much lower level over the last five periods (P34-P38: 97, 72, 53, 79, 56), averaging approximately 71 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Since Period 38 ended with 20 units on-hand, I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime while providing some buffer for the slight volatility seen in Period 37. This approach balances the lower seasonal demand with the need to avoid overstocking and incurring holding costs as we approach late Q4.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn demand decline confirmed: Demand for P34-P38 (97, 72, 53, 79, 56) averages ~71 units, a 50% decrease from the previous stable Autumn regime (~144 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the HW Denim Trousers (640021005) is in a clear late-autumn decline. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P34-P39) is approximately 67.3 units (97, 72, 53, 79, 56, 47), which is a significant drop from the previous Autumn steady-state of ~144 seen throughout August and September. The current date is November 11th, and the trend is consistently downward. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs as we head further into late Q4, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower volume regime. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history, so I will continue to use the calculate method for L. This setup balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by targeting the current lower demand level while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy the immediate periods.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Early Winter demand decline confirmed: Since P34 (late Sept), demand has dropped from ~144 units to a 6-period average of ~67 units, reflecting seasonal tapering for the 'Perrie Trash HW Denim' product.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '640021005' (Perrie Trash HW Denim) is in a clear late-autumn/early-winter decline. As of Period 41 (mid-November), demand has significantly dropped from the stable Autumn regime (~144 units) to a much lower level. The last 7 periods (P34-P40) show an average demand of ~61 units (97, 72, 53, 79, 56, 47, 24), but the most recent 3 periods (P38-P40) average only ~42 units, with a notable drop to 24 in Period 40. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making it critical to avoid overstocking during this downturn. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the broader decline while remaining sensitive to the low P40 reading, and recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility accompanying lower volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Winter decline for denim TRS. Since P34, demand has dropped from ~144 to a current 7-period average of 61 units, with the most recent Period 40 dropping to 24 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Perrie Trash HW Denim) is in a clear late-autumn/winter decline. The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Since Period 34 (late Sept), demand has transitioned from a stable ~144 units to a significantly lower regime. The last 8 periods (P34-P41) show demand of 97, 72, 53, 79, 56, 47, 24, and 31. The 3-period moving average is 34 units, and the 5-period average is 47.8 units. Given the 'hard-worn' denim style and the approach of winter in late November, demand is expected to remain low or continue a slight taper. On-hand inventory is 31 units with no units in transit. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which equal profit at $1/unit) during this low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized lower demand (~48 units), which aligns with the current down-trend while providing a small buffer over the most recent observations (24, 31).

The demand for 'Perrie Trash HW Denim' is currently in a late autumn / early winter decline, but Period 42 showed a significant rebound to 78 units (up from a 7-period average of ~44 units). This spike coincides with the week of November 25th, which is the Cyber Monday/Black Friday retail period, explaining the sudden surge. However, seasonal trends for high-waisted denim typically continue to taper as December progresses. My strategy is to capture this slight late-season volatility without overstocking as we approach the end of the game (Period 47). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (averaging ~47 units) to balance the high spike of P42 with the lower values of P38-P41, and use recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility introduced by the holiday spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand increased to 78 units (+77% over previous 4-period average) likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' showed a significant holiday-related spike in Period 42 (78 units), which was expected due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday. In Period 43, demand dropped back to 25 units, which is consistent with the pre-spike late autumn/early winter regime (P34-P41 average was ~57 units, with more recent periods around 25-45 units). As we are now in mid-December (Period 44), I expect demand to remain low or show small pre-Christmas fluctuations but generally stay within the established winter regime. The stockout in Period 42 was due to a parameter set based on the previous declining trend; Period 43's results suggest we are returning to that lower baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use N=10 for mu_hat to capture the broader late-season average (approx 55 units) while accounting for the recent spike, providing a conservative buffer against further holiday volatility without excessive overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand returned to winter baseline (25 units) following the Period 42 holiday spike, confirming the spike was a temporary event rather than a regime shift.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16th (Period 45). Demand for 'Perrie Trash HW Denim' has exited the high-volatility Autumn/Back-to-School season and is now in a low-demand Winter regime. After a brief holiday spike in Period 42 (78 units), demand has returned to a lower baseline, with the last two periods recording 25 and 17 units respectively. The current 4-period average (P41-P44) is 37.75 units. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same-period). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this post-holiday stabilization and lower baseline. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to account for the variance observed during the transition from the spike. With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level, which is appropriate for this lower-demand period to minimize holding costs as the game approaches its end (Period 47).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: After the P42 spike (78), demand for P43-P44 has averaged 21 units, confirming a return to the winter low-demand regime.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' is in a low-demand winter regime. Following a temporary holiday spike in Period 42 (78 units), demand has returned to a baseline of approximately 21-28 units per week (P43-P45). Current on-hand inventory is 12 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. For Period 46 (Dec 23), demand is expected to remain low as the Christmas holiday typically shifts consumer focus away from standard denim and towards holiday-specific attire or results in store closures/reduced shopping activity. I will use the recent 3 periods (P43-P45) as the regime for N, which accurately reflects the post-spike stabilization levels (25, 17, 28). This results in a mu_hat calculation based on a mean of ~23.3 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Historical data confirms that '640021005' (Spring/Summer denim) has entered a winter low-demand regime since late September (Period 34). Following a brief holiday spike in Period 42 (Black Friday), demand has dropped significantly. The last four periods (P43-P46) show demand figures of 25, 17, 28, and 8, resulting in a recent average of 19.5 units. With on-hand inventory at 16 units and no units in transit, and entering the final period of the game, I will set mu_hat to reflect this low-demand baseline (N=4) to avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a slim buffer for any end-of-year clearance or residual demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 based on history.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year demand baseline (P43-P46) confirmed at ~19.5 units, down from the Autumn average of ~144 units, confirming a deep seasonal trough for this denim SKU.
