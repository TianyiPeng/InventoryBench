Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 610776022 is a Women's T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 53, 132, 222, 242, 233. This suggests a growth phase or early spring seasonality. The mean of the last 3 samples is approximately 232. To capture this recent regime shift and avoid under-stocking while on-hand is zero, I will use recent_N with N=3 to compute the demand parameters. The promised lead time is 0, and since we have no delivery history yet, I will use the default lead time setting.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). The demand was 267 units, which exceeded the historical samples (mean ~184, max 242) and resulted in a stockout (sold 233, ending inventory 0). The item is a 'Tilly' jersey T-shirt, which is a fashion basic. The recent demand trend (132, 222, 242, 233, 267) shows a significant upward trajectory, likely entering a peak seasonal period for spring basics. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring we target a base stock sufficient to cover the current upward trend.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's basic T-shirt. We are currently in late February (Period 3), which often sees a seasonal ramp-up in demand for basics as spring approaches. Historical demand has shown a clear upward trend: 53, 132, 222, 242, 233 (pre-game samples), followed by realizations of 267 (P1) and 354 (P2). The current system has stock-out in both P1 and P2 because the realized demand significantly exceeded the orders placed. The lead time (L) is confirmed to be 0 periods based on P1 and P2 'conclude' messages. To address the demand growth and frequent stock-outs, I am switching to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent high realization (354) and the samples immediately preceding it. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to account for the increasing volatility observed as demand scales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Observed demand has increased from an average of ~200 in pre-game samples to 354 in Period 2, suggesting a seasonal uptrend for basic apparel in Feb/March.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776022' is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. As we move into early March, we are entering the Spring season, which typically sees an increase in demand for lightweight apparel. Looking at the historical demand (Jan samples: 53, 132, 222, 242; Feb samples: 233, 267, 354, 277), there is a clear upward trend from late Jan into early March. The last three weeks average ~299 units. Period 2 (354) may have been an outlier or a peak, but Period 3 settled at 277. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given the high stockout risk seen in P1 and P2 (holding cost $1 vs Profit $1 leads to a 50% target service level, but the capped stock policy limits over-ordering), I will use the last 4 periods to capture the recent Spring ramp-up while smoothing the P2 spike. This covers the most relevant seasonal window.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are managing a Women's Everyday Jersey T-shirt 'Tilly' as of March 11, 2019. Historical demand shows a spike in mid-February (avg ~310 for Periods 1-2) followed by a cooling trend in late Feb/early March (avg ~222 for Periods 3-4). The current on-hand inventory is 117 units. Past lead times have consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for the recent cooling trend after the initial February surge, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the game-time demand dynamics (average ~266) while remaining responsive to the lower volume observed in Period 4. sigma_hat is set to 'default' to incorporate broader variability given the early stage of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (March 18). Historical demand for this basic T-shirt showed a peak in February (averaging ~310 in P1-P2) but has since cooled significantly in March (averaging ~168 in P4-P5). This suggests the earlier 'demand regime shift' mentioned in carry-over insights was either short-lived or seasonal for that specific Feb window. With Lead Time confirmed as 0 (all orders arrived immediately), we need to adjust for this lower demand level to avoid overstocking, as holding cost ($1.0) equals profit ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent stabilization around 170-200 units, while keeping L at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: Mean demand decreased from ~300 to ~170 (-43%) following the February peak.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/25. The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Historically, demand peaked in mid-February (~354) and settled into a lower regime in early March (~168). However, Period 6 showed a sudden unexpected spike to 310, causing a stockout. This spike may be related to late-March spring seasonality or a 'payday' effect. Lead time is consistently 0 periods according to all historical 'conclude' messages. To prevent recurring stockouts while accounting for the high volatility (recent jump from 170 to 310), I will use the recent_N method for demand and sigma. Specifically, N=3 covers the transition from the low regime (Periods 4 and 5) to the recent spike (Period 6), providing a more reactive forecast than the full history while acknowledging recent variability.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Reviewing historical demand: Period 6 (310) and Period 7 (256) show a significant rebound from the dip seen in Periods 4 and 5 (average ~168), following an initial high in February. This suggests a transition into a higher spring demand regime. The previous carry-over insight about a decrease in Period 4 is now outdated given the last two periods' performance. I will focus on the most recent 4 periods (Periods 4-7) to capture this recovery while acknowledging the variability. Lead time remains consistent at 0. mu_hat will use recent_N=4 to capture the current upward trend while smoothing the Period 4/5 dip. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to account for the high volatility (166 to 310) recently observed, which is necessary given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5), meaning the OR engine will target the median demand and requires accurate volatility to avoid stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: Demand recovered from the early March dip (avg ~168) to a higher spring level (avg ~283 in P6-P7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/4/8), historical lead time consistently remains 0. Demand for this Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt has stabilized in a high-demand spring regime after the March volatility. Over the last three periods (P6-P8), demand was [310, 256, 204], averaging ~257 units per period. The recent dip from 310 to 204 suggests a cooling from the late March peak but still significantly higher than the early March trough (avg 168). I will set L=0 since all orders have arrived within the same period. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture this post-March recovery regime (P6-P8), balancing the risk of high-demand spikes with the recent downward trend in the last week. With a Profit/Holding cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, requiring the base stock to align closely with the mean of the current regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776022' is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, a basic apparel item. Historically, we saw a demand surge in February, a mid-March dip, and a recovery in late March. Most recently, demand has stabilized or slightly declined (204 units in Period 8 and 173 units in Period 9). In the last four periods (P6-P9), the mean demand is 235.75 units. Given that we are now in mid-April (2019/4/15), we are entering the peak spring/summer season for lightweight T-shirts. I expect demand to remain steady or slightly increase from the recent average. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand regime (P6-P9), providing a balanced forecast that accounts for the recent recovery and subsequent stabilization.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a stable regime. Since Period 7, demand has been: 256, 204, 173, 206, which averages approximately 210 units per week. This follows a peak in late March and appears to be leveling off as we move further into spring. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by arrivals in Periods 1 through 10. The OR backend uses a service level approach; since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (q = 1 / (1 + 1)). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this most recent stable demand regime (P7-P10) for both mean and standard deviation, which will help the backend produce a base stock that minimizes both lost sales and excess inventory costs in this stable environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at Period 7: Avg demand for last 4 periods is ~210 units, compared to the higher volatility seen in March.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Historically, the lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods as promised. Demand has shown several shifts, but has recently stabilized around a moderate spring level. The last 5 periods (P7-P11) show demands of 256, 204, 173, 206, and 291, averaging 226 units. The most recent demand (291) suggests a potential uptick as we move into warmer weather/May. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, though the OR engine's internal calculations and the safety stock cap will moderate the final order. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture this stabilized spring regime, while maintaining the default lead time of 0.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776022' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is entering early May. Historical data shows consistent lead times of 0 periods. Recent demand has trended upward: Period 11 (291 units) and Period 12 (278 units), averaging 284.5 units per period over the last two weeks. This is a significant increase compared to the April average (Periods 8-10) of ~194 units. As we move further into spring/summer seasonality for lightweight jersey basics, I am adjusting the demand forecast to reflect this recent higher-volume regime. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this upward shift while including a slightly longer historical context to buffer against volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to demand exceeding supply in the last period, requiring a prompt restock to meet the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Mean demand increased from ~194 in April to ~285 (+47%) as May begins, reflecting seasonal interest in lightweight basics.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776022 (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a spring/summer demand phase. While Period 13 saw a dip in demand (168 units), the preceding periods (P11-P12) showed a strong uptrend with an average of ~285 units. Period 13's lower demand is likely a transient fluctuation rather than a regime shift, especially given the May 13th date which typically supports strong sales for 'lightweight jersey' basics. The promised lead time of 0 periods has remained stable and consistent across all 13 periods, as confirmed by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in every concluding message. To ensure we capture the recent shift to a higher May baseline while smoothing over the Period 13 outlier, I am using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (covering Periods 10-13, which includes the lower P10/P13 and higher P11/P12), providing a balanced forecast of approx 236 units per period. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which typically sees sustained demand as late spring transitions into summer. Analyzing recent history: Period 11 (291), Period 12 (278), Period 13 (168), and Period 14 (161). While the last two periods show a dip, the average over the last four periods is approximately 224.5. Given the product's description and the mid-May date (2019/5/20), I anticipate demand will stabilize or slightly increase. All orders have arrived with a lead_time of 0, so L=0 is maintained. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the recent mean of ~225, which balances the early May spike with the more recent cooling. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the actual volatility seen in the May transition.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is entering its peak summer season. Historical demand shows high volatility: Periods 11-12 saw demand around 280-290, while Periods 13-14 dipped to ~165, and Period 15 spiked back to 241 (capping out at on-hand stock). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the seasonal uptrend in late May and the stockout in Period 15, I am focusing on the most recent demand regime starting from Period 11. Specifically, the mean demand of the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 227.8 units, while the standard deviation remains high. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this recent variance and mean, ensuring the base stock calculation (which targets a 50% service level when profit equals holding cost) accounts for both the seasonal strength and the high oscillation in weekly sales for basic summer apparel.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a seasonal summer staple. Recent demand shows a recovery towards late May, with demand values of 241 and 238 in the last two periods, following a dip in mid-May. Historical data suggests the lead time is consistently 0 periods. As we enter the summer season (June), demand for basic T-shirts is expected to remain high and potentially increase further. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the May/June stabilization (mean demand ~197, but influenced by recent high demand of ~240) and calculating sigma from the same window. This balances the recent volatility while ensuring sufficient stock for the expected June demand peak.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. The product is a women's lightweight T-shirt, which is in high seasonal demand during the summer months. Historical data (Periods 11-17) shows a stabilized but high demand regime following the May uptick, with an average demand of approximately 226 units (Demand: 291, 278, 168, 161, 241, 238, 203). Although demand fluctuates, the recent mean provides a reliable anchor for early summer. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. Given that profit matches holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level q is 0.5 (z \u2248 0). To provide a slight buffer for summer volatility without excessive holding costs, I will use a recent window of N=7 periods (covering late April through early June) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the current stabilized seasonal level. Lead time L will remain set to the promised 0 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a women's lightweight jersey t-shirt, typically a staple for summer. Reviewing recent demand (Periods 14-18): 161, 241, 238, 203, 169. This averages to approximately 202.4 units per week. There was a peak in late May (P15-16) which has since moderated as we enter mid-June. No systematic supply chain issues are evident; specifically, all shipments since Period 1 have maintained a lead time of 0 periods. Based on the stabilization of demand following the late May peak, I will use a window of the last 8 periods (N=8, covering roughly early May to mid-June) to capture the current early-summer demand level and volatility. This period includes both the May spikes (291, 278) and the recent June cooling, providing a balanced forecast for the OR engine.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a women's basic t-shirt, which typically sees consistent demand through the summer months. Over the last four periods (P16-P19), demand has slowed down from a May peak, averaging 193 units (238, 203, 169, 162). This suggests a cooling off from the early summer surge noted in the Period 13 carry-over. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level for a basic item with a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level naturally by the OR engine, though the cap mechanism provides some buffer), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods to reflect this lower demand regime. N=4 is selected as the regime length since the drop from ~240 to ~160 occurred after P16.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Average demand for the last 4 periods has decreased to ~193, compared to the ~285 average observed in May.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees high demand in summer but can experience shifts as the season progresses. Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift around Period 17 (early June). In the last 4 periods (P17-P20), demand has been consistently lower (203, 169, 162, 152) compared to the May peak, averaging approximately 171.5 units per period. The standard deviation over this same 4-period window is approximately 21.8. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the steady decline as we move into July, I am using a recent_N of 4 to capture this lower-demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to balance the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), targeting a 50% service level plus the safety factor provided by the cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 17: Average demand has decreased from ~230 to ~172 (-25%) as of early July, indicating a mid-summer cooling for this basic T-shirt SKU.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear downward shift starting around Period 17 (early June). The average demand from Period 17 to Period 21 is approximately 166 units (203, 169, 162, 152, 143), which is significantly lower than the May peak of ~285 units. This downward trend appears stable, as the last four periods have all seen demand between 143 and 169 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is q = 0.5 (z* = 0), making the base stock essentially equal to the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1). To capture this lower but stable demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and volatility. This ensures the order quantity reflects the current mid-summer cooling trend for this SKU.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees peak demand in spring and early summer, followed by a mid-summer cooling. Reviewing the demand history since the detected regime shift at Period 17 (June 3), demand has consistently decreased: 203, 169, 162, 152, 143, and 129. The average demand over these last 6 periods is approximately 159.7, which is a significant drop from the May average of ~285. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while demand is trending downward, I will set L to 'calculate' (which results in 0) and use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this lower-demand regime specifically. This will align our base stock with the current mid-July sales pace.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776022 (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a downward demand trend as mid-summer progresses. Historical demand has decreased significantly from the May peak (~285) to a more recent average. Over the last 4 periods (P20-P23), demand has been 152, 143, 129, and 106, averaging approximately 132 units per period. The most recent demand (106) is the lowest recorded in the game history, confirming a sustained cooling trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which equal profit at $1.0/unit), I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this recent lower-demand regime. Using recent_N with N=4 captures this specific summer decline while providing enough stability to handle the moderate variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Sustained decline confirmed through July, with average demand dropping to ~132 units (P20-P23) compared to the ~180-190 seen in early June.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirts has been steadily declining throughout July, reaching a new low of 70 units in Period 24. This confirms the previously identified regime shift starting at Period 20. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 120 units, but the most recent two periods (P23-P24) have seen 106 and 70 units respectively, suggesting a potentially faster decline as we exit the peak summer season. To prevent excess inventory given the $1/unit holding cost, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the July downturn, while acknowledging the downward trend. Reported lead times have consistently been 0 periods, with no missed shipments observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Late summer cooling intensified, with demand dropping from an average of ~140 in early July to 88 units (avg of P23-P24), a decline of ~37% from the previous mid-summer level.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues its late-summer demand decline. Recent demand samples show a clear downward trend: 106 (P23), 70 (P24), and 52 (P25), with an average of 76 units over the last three periods. This represents a significant drop from the ~130-140 unit average observed in early July. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs during this cooling phase, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N approach with N=3 to capture the most current demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the reduced volatility at these lower volume levels while maintaining the target service level.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Women's Everyday Basics T-shirts' is in a sharp seasonal decline as we move through August. The average demand has dropped significantly: P21-P23 averaged ~126 units, but the most recent periods (P24-P26) have dropped to 70, 52, and 35 units respectively. This represents a cooling trend of over 50% in the last 3 weeks. With 41 units currently on hand and a lead time of 0, the primary risk is overstocking and incurring holding costs ($1/unit) that equal the profit margin ($1/unit). I will use a very recent 3-period window (N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this rapid decline. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: Late summer demand continues to drop significantly, with the average of the last 3 periods (P24-P26) falling to ~52 units, compared to the ~126 units seen in early July.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776022' is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is showing a clear end-of-season decline as we enter late August. Looking at the last four periods (P24-P27), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level (70, 52, 35, 38), averaging approximately 49 units per period. This confirms the downward regime shift identified previously. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this clearance/end-of-season phase, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the most recent demand floor and sigma_hat with recent_N=4 to reflect the reduced volatility at these lower volumes. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), so the OR backend will target a 50% service level, which is appropriate for a product at the end of its seasonal cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor established in late August: Average demand for P24-P27 is ~49 units, down from the ~130 units seen in early July, confirming the end of the summer season for this lightweight jersey SKU.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt has stabilized at a significantly lower level as the summer season ends. The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P25-P28) is 42 units, a stark contrast to the earlier spring/summer peaks. Period 28 saw a demand of 43 units. Given that the product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, we are likely entering a low-demand baseline for late August/September. On-hand inventory is currently very low (6 units). Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5, covering P24-P28) to capture this established floor while allowing for minor fluctuations. This results in a mu_hat of approx 48 units (Average of 70, 52, 35, 38, 43), ensuring we maintain enough stock for the current period's demand without overstocking and incurring holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has localized at a lower stable level as we enter September, cooling significantly from the summer peaks. The last four periods (P26-P29) show consistent demand between 35 and 43 units, with an average of approximately 38 units. This represents a confirmed demand floor following the late summer decline noted in previous carry-over insights. Since the actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history, I will continue using the default lead time setting. To align inventory with this current low-demand regime and avoid excess holding costs (given the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods of data. This will calculate a base stock target that reflects current market appetite for this basic SKU during the seasonal transition.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt has stabilized at a low 'floor' level following a significant summer cooling. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P24-P30) is approximately 45 units. The most recent demand (P30) was 42 units, slightly above the order amount, leading to a stockout. Given the stability of this late-season demand (mean ~42 for the last 3 periods), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this established floor while smoothing out minor fluctuations. Sigma_hat will also use N=7 to reflect the current low volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776022 is a basic T-shirt in lightweight jersey, which has seen a significant demand decrease as the summer season ended. The Carry-over insights and recent history confirm a stable 'demand floor' established in late August (Period 28). For the last 4 periods (P28-P31), demand has been 43, 35, 42, and 34, resulting in a mean of 38.5 units. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime accurately while maintaining a lean inventory to minimize holding costs, especially since on-hand inventory is currently at 11 units. This approach balances the service level for this low-demand period with the high relative holding cost ($1.0 vs $1.0 profit).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776022 (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a stable low-demand period following the summer season. Since late August (Period 28), the demand has leveled out. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P28-P32), the demand values are 43, 35, 42, 34, and 33, with a mean of 37.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 4.7. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. Given the low volatility and established floor, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this stabilized regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This approach ensures we maintain enough stock for the base demand while avoiding high holding costs for this basic item during its off-peak season.

Demand has stabilized at a low level following the end-of-summer decline noted in the carry-over insights. Current date is Sep 30, which is the start of the autumn season. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (P28-P33) has been extremely stable, averaging 36.6 units with very low volatility (std \u2248 4.3). This suggests a consistent 'baseline' demand for year-round basics after the summer peak. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this stable floor for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time of 0 has been consistently met (actual lead time 0), so I will use the default method for L to maintain thin inventory levels given the low demand and equal profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for this SKU has remained exceptionally stable since late August (Period 28). The average demand over the last seven periods (P28-P34) is 36.3 units, with very low volatility (standard deviation ~4 units). This confirms the 'demand floor' identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Given the high stability, I am selecting a recent window (N=7) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will accurately reflect the current low-demand environment and minimize unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this low-margin/high-holding-cost-ratio SKU.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October. Since the 'demand floor' was established in late August (Period 24/28), demand has remained remarkably stable. For the last 8 periods (P28-P35), demand has ranged between 25 and 43, with an average of approximately 35 units. The lightweight jersey t-shirt is in a low-demand trough for the autumn season. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this stabilized low-demand regime, ensuring we don't over-index on either the slightly higher start-of-September demand or the most recent dip to 25. This setting balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by targeting a 50% service level base stock, which is appropriate for a mature, low-volatility phase of the product lifecycle.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 21st, 2019. This SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a stable low-demand regime following the end of summer. Demand has consistently averaged ~31 units over the last 10 periods (P27-P36). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P33-P36) show an average demand of 29 units with very low volatility. Actual lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established autumn floor while filtering out the higher summer volatility. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock for the base service level without incurring excessive holding costs as demand stabilizes at this lower level.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt SKU has stabilized at a low floor following its peak summer season. Over the last 10 periods (P28-P37), demand has averaged 35.1 units, significantly lower than the ~250 units seen in the spring. Period 37 saw a minor spike to 38 units, which depleted the on-hand inventory. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the game. Given that the product is a staple/basic item, demand is expected to remain around this current level (~30-40 units) during the late autumn/winter months, unless a specific holiday promotion or end-of-year clearance occurs. I will use a recent_N approach for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current stable low-demand window precisely, while using the calculate method for lead time to reflect the consistent 0-period performance.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which has seen demand stabilize at a very low 'winter floor' since late August (Period 28). Current date is November 4th. Demand over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) has averaged approximately 31.5 units, with the most recent sample (P38) at a low of 17. Looking at the last 5 periods (P34-P38), the average is 27.6 units. Given the holding cost and profit are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level plus safety stock. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current late-autumn stabilization while acknowledging the recent dip. Sigma will also be calculated over the last 10 samples to capture the low volatility of this floor regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor for winter season: Average demand for women's basic T-shirt has stabilized around 30 units (P29-P38) following the late-summer decline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product is a women's basic lightweight jersey T-shirt. Observed demand has declined significantly from summer peaks and has stabilized at a low 'winter floor' over the last 11 periods (P29-P39). Specifically, the average demand for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is approximately 22.4 units, and the most recent demand in Period 39 was only 8 units, suggesting a potential further dip as we move deeper into November. With on-hand inventory at 20 units and no units in transit, the current stock covers nearly the entire expected demand for the upcoming period based on recent averages. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should target the mean demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the stable winter regime while allowing for the lower volatility seen recently. This will keep base stock levels tight to avoid unnecessary holding costs on a slow-moving item during the off-season.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt'. Demand has remained stable at a low winter floor since late August. Over the last 12 periods (P29-P40), demand has averaged 28.2 units with low volatility. Recent demand in P39 and P40 (8 and 15 units respectively) suggests a possible softening even below the previous 30-unit floor, likely due to the deep winter season. I will use a shorter window (N=5) to capture any late-season downward drift while maintaining enough stock to cover the average winter demand. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to satisfy around 30 units of demand with minimal holding cost, given the $1/$1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its off-season (winter). Demand has been stable at a low floor since late August. Over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the average demand is 23.6 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P39-P41) show a further dip to an average of 12 units. This aligns with late November being a low point for lightweight basic T-shirts before potential holiday or spring resets. Given the equal weight of profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a 50th percentile service level. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current stable winter demand regime while smoothing out the very recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as seen in the entire game history.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). This SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal decline from summer peaks (~150-200 units) to a stable winter floor (~30 units from P29-P38) and a further reduction in November (P39-P42 avg ~14.5 units). For Period 42, demand was 22, likely reflecting post-Black Friday activity, but the overall trend remains low. Given the 0-period lead time is consistent (actual = promised), I will focus on the most recent 10-period regime (P33-P42) to capture the current winter low while accounting for November's specific volatility. The OR engine's service level logic (profit $1 vs. holding $1) targets a 50% service level (q = 0.5), which is appropriate for a stable, low-demand phase to minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Mid-winter demand contraction confirmed: Average demand for P39-P42 has dropped to ~15 units, down from the ~30 unit floor observed in early autumn.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for SKU 610776022 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a mid-winter contraction. The average demand from Period 39 to Period 43 is approximately 12.8 units (8, 15, 13, 22, 6), which is significantly lower than the previous autumn floor of ~30. The most recent observation (Period 43) was particularly low at 6 units. We are now in mid-December (2019/12/9), a period where interest in lightweight jersey basic t-shirts is typically at an annual minimum. Consequently, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=5 (covering the specific winter regime from P39-P43) to align inventory levels with this reduced demand and avoid unnecessary holding costs. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed throughout the history.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' has entered a deep winter contraction as of mid-November (Period 39 onwards). In the last six periods (P39-P44), demand has been very low: 8, 15, 13, 22, 6, and 3, respectively. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P41-P44) is 11 units. Given that the current on-hand inventory is 14 units and there's only two periods remaining in the game (P46 and P47), the current stock is likely sufficient to cover the remaining demand with minimal or no additional ordering. The holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit per unit ($1.0), which penalizes overstocking heavily. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect this contraction and use recent_N for sigma to account for the low volatility in this regime. Lead time remains 0.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the peak of the winter season for a lightweight women's jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand has hit a floor in mid-winter, with the Period 43 carry-over insight confirming a drop to an average of ~15 units. However, the last three actual demand samples (P43-P45) have been even lower: 6, 3, and 8 units, averaging 5.6 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the system must avoid overstocking during this extremely low-demand phase. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this most recent drop to single-digit demand. Lead time remains consistently 0, so I will continue using the default. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the reduced volatility at these lower volumes.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Demand has dropped further into a deep winter trough, averaging ~6 units over the last 3 periods (P43-P45), significantly lower than the ~15 unit floor identified in Period 43.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is in a deep winter seasonal trough. Recent demand (P44-P46) has been 3, 8, and 5 units respectively, averaging 5.33 units per period. This confirms the 'deep winter trough' regime identified in Period 46. With a promised lead time of 0 and actual lead times consistently observed at 0, the system is highly responsive. The on-hand inventory is 1 unit. Given the low demand and equal balance between profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this minimal demand level (including P43's 6 units), resulting in a forecast that avoids overstocking while maintaining a tiny buffer for this very low-volume period.
