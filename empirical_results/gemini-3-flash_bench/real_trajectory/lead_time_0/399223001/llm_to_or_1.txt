Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Curvy Jeggings HW Ankle', a staple denim item. Historically, the demand for the last five weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) has been [258, 233, 280, 234, 298], showing a relatively stable demand with a slight upward tick in the most recent week. The mean of these 5 samples is 260.6. Since we start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. The promised lead time is 0. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the recent stable demand pattern for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'default' lead time of 0. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock (L+1 periods of demand) sufficient to cover the current period's expected demand (~260 units) plus a safety stock buffer based on historical volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Curvy Jeggings', a staple denim item. History shows stable demand (233-298) with an average of 260.6 over the last 5 pre-game weeks plus Period 1 (where demand was 298). The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirm this (ordered 308, arrived 308 same period). Current on-hand is low (10 units) because Period 1 demand (298) almost depleted the order. Given the stability of the demand and the confirmed 0-period lead time, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand (avg ~268 over last 5 relevant samples). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Looking at the SKU 'Curvy Jeggings HW Ankle', we have observed two actual lead times of 0 periods (matching the promised lead time). The historical demand data provided (258, 233, 280, 234, 298) and the game history demand (298, 272) show a relatively stable pattern with a mean around 267.8 units. There is no clear seasonal shift or changepoint detected in these early February/late February weeks for denim jeggings. Therefore, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the most relevant recent demand (reflecting the last 3 historical samples plus 2 game history samples). Since L=0, the backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+0) * average demand. This captures the current regime while maintaining a tight stock buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3660.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223001' (Curvy Jeggings) has shown a historical mean demand of approximately 256 units (pre-game samples: 258, 233, 280, 234, 298), but actual demand in the first three periods has been 298, 272, and 199. The most recent demand (199) suggests a drop as we move into March. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (P1, P2, P3) confirm an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently at 121 units. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (calculated critical ratio q \u2248 0.95), I will use the last 3 periods to estimate demand mu_hat and sigma_hat (recent_N method) to capture the recent downward trend in demand while maintaining a buffer for volatility. mu_hat will be calculated by the backend as (1+L)*mean_last_3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3199.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Curvy Jeggings' has shown a decreasing demand trend over the last four periods (298, 272, 199, 177). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time = 0). Since the on-hand inventory (164) is currently nearly equal to the most recent weekly demand (177), and the demand trend is clearly downward, I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and prevent overstocking. This results in a mu_hat based on the average of periods 2, 3, and 4. The OR backend will automatically adjust the base stock using these parameters to balance the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Significant downward demand trend observed from Period 1 (298) to Period 4 (177), a 40% decrease over 4 weeks. Lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3462.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/18. The product is Curvy Jeggings. Analysis of the demand history (298, 272, 199, 177, 188) shows a clear downward shift from the initial levels observed in Jan/Feb. The last documented 'Period 5 conclude' confirms that Period 4 (177) and Period 5 (188) are stabilizing at a lower regime compared to the early samples (>230). I will use recent_N=3 to capture this new lower-demand regime (avg ~188) while moving away from the high initial samples. Lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by 'arrived=X units (ordered on Period Z, lead_time was 0 periods)' in all historical periods. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current lower-demand trend, reducing unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower regime (approx 180-190 units/week) starting Period 4 (March), down from 250+ in Jan/Feb.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7 (2019/03/25), the 'Curvy Jeggings' are in a stable demand regime after searching for a floor earlier in the month. Since Period 4 (start of March), demand has consistently hovered between 177 and 201 units, with the most recent sample being 201. This is a significant shift from the January/February average of ~250-280. I will prioritize the last 3 periods (Periods 4, 5, and 6) to set the forecast, as they represent this new stable lower-demand regime. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. On-hand inventory is very low (6 units), so a full replenishment for this period's demand (approx 190-200 units) is expected from the OR backend. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the current March stability, and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat provides a localized volatility estimate consistent with this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3971.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7 (2019/3/25), there was a sudden and significant demand spike to 343 units, which is much higher than the previous 4-week average of ~190. This resulted in a stockout (sold 209 out of 343 requested). This spike aligns with the transition from March to April (early Spring seasonality for 'Curvy Jeggings'). I am abandoning the previous low-demand regime assumption and shifting to a more responsive forecast. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the shift (including the stable March weeks and the Period 7 spike) to ensure the base stock is high enough to handle rising seasonal demand while the OR engine calculates the necessary safety stock for this increased volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand shift detected at the end of March: Demand increased from a stable ~190 range to 343 in Period 7 (+80% increase). This likely reflects Spring seasonality for denim products.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/04/08) following a significant spring demand spike in period 7 (343 units). While period 8 demand moderated to 237, the item (Curvy Jeggings) is entering its peak seasonal window. I've detected a significant demand regime shift at Period 7: previous mean was approx. 190, but the last two periods averaged 290 (+52%). The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts similar to Period 7, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture this new, higher-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness to the high volatility seen in the spring transition.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand regime confirmed starting Period 7: average demand shifted from ~190 to ~290 (+52% increase) with higher variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2766.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Curvy Jeggings shows significant volatility following a confirmed seasonal shift in late March (Period 7). After a peak of 343 units in Period 7, demand was 237 and most recently 159. The current date (April 15) is well into the spring season. The previous carry-over insight estimated a new regime mean of ~290, but the last two periods suggest that while demand is higher than the early March slump, it is highly erratic. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the average of the spring regime (approx 246 units per period), and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility (approx 93 units). Given the on-hand inventory of 255 and a reliable lead time of 0, this approach seeks to maintain sufficient safety stock for potential spikes while avoiding excessive holding costs if demand returns to lower levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1841.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the demand history for 'Curvy Jeggings', we observed a significant peak in late March (Period 7: 343 units), which was identified as a Spring seasonal shift. however, demand in the last two periods has dropped significantly (Period 9: 159, Period 10: 112). This suggest the initial Spring surge has stabilized or entered a post-peak lull. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 287 units. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for potential late-Spring demand, I will use recent_N to capture this lower volume regime. For mu_hat, N=4 covers the period from the surge to the present (Avg ~212 per week). For sigma_hat, N=4 captures the increased volatility during this seasonal transition (Std ~101). L remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in April: Following a late March peak of 343, demand dropped 67% to 112 units by mid-April, indicating a high-variance Spring regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 29, 2019. We are analyzing the 'Curvy Jeggings' SKU. History shows that demand for this item is highly volatile during the Spring season. After an initial surge in late March (343 units), demand dropped significantly in early April to a low of 112, but has now recovered slightly to 178 units in Period 11. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the current volatile regime, I am using a recent window of 5 periods (Periods 7-11) to capture the higher variance and mean of the Spring season. This results in a mean demand of approximately 205.8 units. Given the high on-hand inventory of 201 units and the 0-period lead time, the base stock calculation will likely result in a small replenishment order, balancing the high profit margin against the risks of high inventory holding costs in a fluctuating market.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in early May (Period 13). History shows actual lead time is consistently 0. The product 'Curvy Jeggings' experienced a highly volatile Spring regime since late March (Period 7), with demand peaking at 343 and dropping as low as 112. The most recent three periods (P10-P12) show a stabilization and slight recovery in demand (112, 178, 205). To account for this recovery while acknowledging the high volatility of this seasonal period, I am setting mu_hat using the mean of the last 4 periods (N=4, avg=163.5) to capture the recent upward momentum without overshooting due to the earlier March peak. Sigma_hat is set using N=6 to cover the entire volatile period from Period 7 onwards, ensuring the safety stock accounts for the high variance observed in this Spring season.

Carry-over insight: May demand stabilization: After reaching a mid-April low, demand has increased sequentially for two periods (112 to 178 to 205), suggesting a potential late-Spring/Early-Summer stabilization regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-13. The demand history since Period 7 (Spring regime) has shown high volatility, with demand values of 343, 237, 159, 112, 178, 205, and most recently 149 in Period 13. While there appeared to be a stabilization trend in early May, the drop from 205 to 149 suggests we are still in a high-variance environment (~170-200 mean). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking while maintaining a service level for potential upside, I will use a recent window (N=4) to capture the current post-peak Spring behavior (Periods 10-13), which yields a mean demand of approximately 161 (112, 178, 205, 149). This responds to the recent downward correction from the late April peak while the sigma calculation will remain broad to handle the observed variance.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223001' (Curvy Jeggings) has transitioned into a more stable late-Spring regime following the extreme volatility seen in late March and April. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand has stabilized with values 178, 205, 149, 172, averaging approximately 176 units per week. This is a significant shift from the March peak and April low. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability over the last month (May), I am using a recent_N of 4 to capture this current demand regime for both my mu_hat and sigma_hat forecasts. This targets a demand level of ~176, preventing excessive holding costs from the older high-demand periods while maintaining enough stock to cover the current sales rate. The current on-hand inventory of 114 is slightly below the 4-period average, so the OR backend should trigger a small replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: May demand stabilization confirmed: Period 11-14 demand shows a stable regime averaging 176 units/week, moving away from April's high volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. We are in a stable late-spring demand regime for Curvy Jeggings. Analysis of the last 5 periods (P11-P15) shows demand figures of 178, 205, 149, 172, and 138, yielding a mean of 168.4. This confirms the stabilization previously noted around 170-180 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals in the history. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this stable regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. The target service level (q) computed by the OR backend is high (0.95), which should prevent stockouts during this period while inventory levels are relatively low (on-hand is 76).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. We are moving from late Spring into Early Summer. Historical demand for these Jeggings has stabilized following the high volatility seen in April. In the last four periods (P13-P16), demand has settled into a lower, more consistent regime: 149, 172, 138, and 122 units, averaging approximately 145 units per week. This indicates a cooling off from the Spring peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in history. Given the stability over the last 4 periods, I will set N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent plateau. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that reflects current demand levels (approx 145/week) rather than being biased by the much higher volumes seen at the start of the year or the high-variance April spikes. This should maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs on the 90 units currently on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Summer demand stabilization confirmed (P13-P16); mean demand has decreased to approx 145 units/week compared to the earlier Spring average of ~176.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Curvy Jeggings' has continued to decline into June, following a trend observed since mid-May. The most recent demand (Period 17) was 102 units, consistent with the identified 'Summer demand stabilization' regime. Analyzing periods 14-17, the mean demand is approximately 133.5 units per week (172, 138, 122, 102). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this downward seasonal shift, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current lower mean, and use sigma_hat from the same period to reflect current volatility. This configuration helps the OR engine target a base stock level appropriate for the immediate demand expectation while accounting for the lower holding cost preference relative to the profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Early Summer demand decline confirmed: Mean demand for Periods 14-17 (mid-May to early June) has dropped to 134 units/week, a significant decrease from the early May average of 176 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 17, Curvy Jeggings are in a stable early-summer decline. Demand has consistently stayed between 102 and 122 units for the last four periods (Period 15-18), averaging 117.75 units per week. This follows a clear downward trend from the May average of 176. The historical lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will adjust the OR parameters to focus on this most recent stable regime (N=4) to prevent overstocking as we move deeper into the summer months. The on-hand inventory of 74 is sufficient to meet a portion of this expected demand, and a zero lead time allows for responsive reordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand regime has stabilized further into June (late spring/early summer), with the last 4 periods (P15-P18) averaging 118 units/week, down from the May average of 176.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are in a late spring/early summer demand regime for Curvy Jeggings. The demand has shown a consistent downward trend over the last several weeks as we transition into warmer summer months. Most recent demands are: P16: 122, P17: 102, P18: 109, P19: 85. The average of the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is 104.5 units/week. This represents a clear shift from the previous regime centered around 118-134. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this most recent downward trend and lower stabilization. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods (order arrives same period). Setting parameters to reflect this lower mean and lower variance to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late June (Period 16-19): Average demand has dropped to 104.5 units/week, down from the early June average of 118 units. This reflects a continued summer seasonal slowdown for this product category.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. Historical demand shows a persistent downward trend throughout June, reaching a low of 48 units in Period 20. The carry-over insights correctly identified a decline in demand as the product (denim jeggings) enters the height of summer. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is 86 units/week, significantly lower than the previous regime. I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized (but lower) demand signal typical of a summer seasonal slowdown. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: July demand regime shift confirmed. Demand reached a new low of 48 in P20, with the 4-week average (P17-P20) dropping to 86 units/week, down from late June's 104.5. This reinforces the summer seasonal decline for denim.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. We are analyzing the demand for 'Curvy Jeggings', a denim product. Historically, this SKU has shown a strong seasonal decline throughout June and early July. However, Period 21 showed a sudden rebound in demand to 111 units, up from 48 units in the previous period. This suggests that the summer decline might have bottomed out or is experiencing early-July volatility. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this recent bounce-back while acknowledging the overall summer lower-demand regime, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the last 5 weeks (P17-P21) where demand averaged approximately 91 units. This N=5 captures the recent spike while smoothing out the extreme low of P20, balancing the risk of understocking if the recovery continues against the risk of overstocking if it was a one-week anomaly.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Potential bottoming of summer decline. Demand rebounded from 48 (P20) to 111 (P21) (+131%). The 5-week average (P17-P21) is 91 units/week.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Last period (P22) saw a significant demand spike to 146 units, which exceeded on-hand inventory (134), resulting in a stockout. This follows a rebound in P21 (111 units), suggesting that the summer demand trough observed in P20 (48 units) has ended and a mid-summer recovery or stabilization is underway. The product (Ladies Denim Jeggings) might be seeing increased interest due to back-to-school preparations or mid-summer sales. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To account for this upward shift and prevent further stockouts, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher means from P21-P22 (avg ~128) rather than the long-term summer decline average.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand recovery detected: Demand increased for two consecutive periods (P21: 111, P22: 146) from a low of 48 in P20, breaking the summer downward trend.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are seeing a mid-summer demand recovery for Curvy Jeggings. Demand has risen from a low of 48 (P20) to 111 (P21), 146 (P22), and 146 (P23), indicating a new stable regime following the summer trough. The last three periods show a consistent mean of ~134 units/week. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent stabilization and recovery while ignoring the extreme summer low of P20, I am setting N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will align the base stock with the most recent sales velocity (average 134) rather than the longer-term summer decline average.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand recovery confirmed (P21-P23): Demand has stabilized at a higher mean of ~134 units/week after bottoming at 48 in P20.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility in July, with a mid-summer recovery spike (P22: 146, P23: 146) followed by a sharp drop in Period 24 (60). The current period date is 2019/7/29. Historically, the 'mid-summer recovery' observed in P21-P23 seems to have encountered significant pull-back. To set parameters for Period 25, I am looking at the most recent regime. The demand for the last 4 periods (P21-P24) was 111, 146, 146, and 60. The mean of these 4 samples is 115.75. Given the high volatility (standard deviation ~41) and the recent drop to 60, I will use a 4-period window (recent_N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance and the shift back to lower levels. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Late-July demand drop confirmed (P24: 60) following a short mid-summer recovery. The 4-week average (P21-P24) is 115.75 units/week with high volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th (Period 26). The product is 'Curvy Jeggings', which has exhibited significant seasonal volatility throughout the year. Most recently, we saw a mid-summer recovery (P21-P23: demand ~134) followed by a sharp drop (P24: 60) and a partial rebound (P25: 112). Assessing the last 5 periods (P21-P25), the average demand is 114.2 units/week with a standard deviation of approximately 34. This current level is substantially lower than the early year/Spring peaks (200-300+). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the high volatility observed in July and August while avoiding overstocking during this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the current mean (approx 114) and using a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect the recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Early August demand shows continued mid-summer volatility: After a sharp drop to 60 (P24), demand recovered to 112 (P25). The 5-week average (P21-P25) has stabilized at approximately 114 units/week.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (early August) shows a significantly higher demand of 182 units, which resulted in a stockout. This follows a period of localized volatility (60, 112, 182). Looking at the historical samples and recent trends, the mid-summer low seems to be transitioning into an early-August recovery or 'back-to-school' interest for this denim product. The last 3 periods of demand (60, 112, 182) average 118 units, but the most recent 2 periods (112, 182) average 147 units. Given the stockout in Period 26, a more responsive forecasting approach is needed to capture this upward movement. I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime shift (averaging 125 units) and use calculate for L as actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Early August demand surge detected: Demand increased for three consecutive weeks (60 to 112 to 182), culminating in a stockout in Period 26, likely signaling a seasonal transition from the mid-summer low.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Curvy Jeggings' has transitioned from its summer low to a pre-fall recovery phase. Period 26 (182) and Period 27 (193) show consecutive high demand, confirming the upward trend detected in Period 27's rationale. The current date (August 19) is a key period for back-to-school and early fall fashion transitions in the retail calendar, which aligns with this significant demand increase for denim products. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent three weeks of this recovery (112, 182, 193), resulting in a mean that reflects this new higher regime (approx 162). Lead time remains consistent at 0. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=3 accounts for the increased volatility seen during this transition period, ensuring the base stock level protects against stockouts during this rising demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand surge confirmed: Demand has shifted from a mid-summer average of ~114 units/week to a pre-fall average of ~187 units/week (P26-P27), a 64% increase driven by seasonal transition.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Curvy Jeggings' is currently undergoing a pre-fall seasonal transition. After bottoming in late June/early July (Period 20 demand: 48), we have seen a significant and sustained increase over the last three weeks (Period 26: 182, Period 27: 193, Period 28: 200). The average demand over the last three periods is 191.7 units, compared to the mid-summer average of 114 units. This indicates a new demand regime associated with the end of August (back-to-school/pre-fall season). I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this abrupt shift. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this higher regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in the history.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall demand regime confirmed (P26-P28): Mean demand has stabilized at ~192 units/week, up from the mid-summer average of ~114 units (+68%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Curvy Jeggings' has transitioned into a pre-fall regime. After a strong late-August surge (averaging ~192 units in P26-P28), Period 29 showed a decrease to 137 units. However, current date (Sept 2nd) and historical seasonality (Jan/Feb samples were 230-300 range) suggest we are entering a sustained high-demand period for denim. The decrease in Period 29 is likely a normal weekly fluctuation within a higher-mean regime rather than a return to summer lows. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher late-August/early-September average (~178 units) while remaining cautious of the Period 29 dip. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4275.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Curvy Jeggings' has transitioned into a pre-fall/fall regime as of late August. In the most recent period (P30), demand reached 225 units, which is a 64% increase over the previous week and matches the start of September. This aligns with typical retail patterns where denim demand strengthens as the weather cools. The last 5 periods (P26-P30) have seen demand values of 182, 193, 200, 137, and 225. Excluding the dip in P29, the average is approx 200. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this elevated fall demand level (approx 210 units) to avoid stockouts, as the product is currently at zero on-hand inventory. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility seen during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Fall renewal confirmed: Late August/Early September demand (P26-P30) has established a new mean of approx 190-210 units/week, up from the summer average of ~114 units (+75%).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019, which is the beginning of the Fall retail season for denim products ('Curvy Jeggings'). We are coming off a significant period of demand growth: Period 31 demand reached 328 units, far exceeding the recent pre-fall average of ~192 units. This follows a stockout in Period 30 (demand 225, all sold) and Period 31 (demand 328, 264 sold). The 'Fall renewal' insight from Period 31 is now being eclipsed by an even stronger seasonal surge. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To handle this accelerating demand and avoid further stockouts, I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering the shift from late August to now: P26-P31) to capture the higher mean and increased volatility of the Fall regime. The mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will reflect this increased activity.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Early Fall surge confirmed. Demand jumped to 328 in Period 31, representing a 70% increase over the previous 5-period average (~191). This marks a transition from 'pre-fall' to 'peak fall' intensity for denim.

Period 32 demand reached 356 units, following 328 in Period 31, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts despite increasing order quantities. This confirms the transition from a 'pre-fall' average of ~190 to a 'peak fall' regime with demand exceeding 300 units per week. The date (late September) aligns with peak denim seasonality. To capture this shift and aggressive growth, mu_hat is set to 350 using the explicit method to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that can cover this new peak. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 50 to reflect high volatility during regime transitions. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Peak Fall demand regime confirmed (P31-P32): Demand has surged to an average of 342 units/week, a +78% increase from the late August mean (~192). This peak seasonal volume for jeggings is now established.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a 'Peak Fall' demand regime for Curvy Jeggings. Demand has consistently increased over the last three weeks (P31: 328, P32: 356, P33: 401). The current mean for this peak phase (P31-P33) is approximately 362 units/week, which is a significant increase from the late August mean of ~192. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this sharp upward seasonal trend and avoid further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 380 (reflecting the most recent demand of 401 and the upward trajectory) and increasing sigma_hat to 50 to account for high volatility during seasonal peaks. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the anticipated high demand for Period 34.

Carry-over insight: Peak Fall demand acceleration confirmed (P31-P33): Demand has scaled from ~328 to 401 units/week, establishing a new peak regime mean of ~362 units (+88% from pre-fall levels).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223001 (Curvy Jeggings) is currently in its 'Peak Fall' demand regime, which started around Period 31 (early September). While demand in Period 34 (284) was lower than the previous three peaks (328, 356, 401), it remains significantly elevated compared to the 'Pre-fall' average of ~192. The recent 4-period average (P31-P34) is 342.25 units. Since we are in early October (Period 35), seasonal demand for denim is expected to remain robust. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the high volatility seen in the last 4 weeks (standard deviation of ~50), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock calculation responds to the current peak regime while accounting for the high coefficient of variation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223001' (Curvy Jeggings) is currently in a Peak Fall demand regime (Mid-September to Mid-October). After a significant demand peak of 401 in Period 33, demand has leveled off to 284 and 262 in the last two periods (P34-P35). This suggests the initial 'back-to-school' or 'early fall' surge has stabilized into a high-volume autumn baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking as we move further into October, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5: P31-P35), which captures the full Fall ramp-up and the recent stabilization (Average: ~326 units). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to account for the high volatility seen during the peak transition.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand stabilization: Following the peak of 401 in P33, demand has averaged 273 units/week over the last two periods (P34-P35), suggesting a stabilization of the Fall regime at a slightly lower level than the absolute peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late-October period (P37). After the Fall peak in September (averaging ~362 units), demand has entered a slightly lower but still high-intensity Fall maintenance regime. Over the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has been 284, 262, and 322 respectively, yielding a recent mean of 289.3 units/week. This represents a cooling from the absolute peak but remains significantly higher than pre-fall levels (~192). The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the current regime, I am using a recent_N approach with N=3 to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient safety stock to handle the observed variance (up to 322). This allows the inventory level to adjust downwards from the peak-stocking levels while preventing stockouts during this sustained high-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Post-Peak Fall stabilization (P34-P36): Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~289 units/week after the September peak of ~362 units, reflecting a high-intensity Fall maintenance phase.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (Period 38: 2019/10/28). Demand has been volatile but strong during the late-Fall season. Period 37 demand (367) surged compared to the previous two weeks (~289 average), resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests a late-October peak or increased cold-weather demand for jeggings. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will adjust mu_hat to capture this recent upward movement by using the average of the last 4 periods (P34-P37: 284, 262, 322, 367), which averages 308.75. Given the stockout in P37, actual demand might have been even higher, so a slightly more responsive average is needed. I'll use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this higher late-fall intensity and elevated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late-October demand surge detected: Period 37 demand reached 367, representing a 27% increase over the preceding post-peak average (~289), causing a stockout and signaling a potential late-season secondary peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are in a high-intensity Fall regime for Curvy Jeggings. Recent demand shows a late-October peak (P37: 367) followed by a slight moderation (P38: 288). The 'Post-Peak Fall maintenance phase' (P34-P38) is currently averaging 304.6 units per week with significant volatility (std dev ~44). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this specific regime while accounting for the high volatility and potential for stockouts observed in P37, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the window starting from late September through the end of October, providing a robust base for early November demand. The target service level (~95%) calculated by the OR backend (19/(19+1)) will help buffer against the high variance of this category.

Carry-over insight: Late Fall maintenance regime confirmed (P34-P38): Demand is averaging 305 units/week with high volatility following the September peak. This represents a sustained regime higher than the initial 'post-peak' estimate of 289.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the 'Late Fall maintenance' regime. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 294.67 units/week (284, 262, 322, 367, 288, 245), down slightly from the absolute peak in September but remains high and volatile. Given the product category (denim), we expect demand to remain strong but potentially begin a seasonal taper as we head into late November. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this post-peak stabilization while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a 6-period window (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent lower readings (288, 245) with the high surge observed in Period 37 (367).

Carry-over insight: Late Fall maintenance regime (P34-P39) confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~295 units/week with significant volatility (std ~45), down from the peak Fall mean of ~362.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18), the demand for Curvy Jeggings is entering a clear late-fall/early-winter decline. Following the peak Fall regime (mean ~362) and the subsequent Fall maintenance phase (mean ~295), the last three periods show a consecutive downward trend: 288, 245, 216. This suggests that the high-demand Fall season is tapering off. The 3-period average is approx 250 units/week. To avoid build-up of excess inventory during this seasonal cooling, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to a more responsive window. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this most recent deceleration while acknowledging that demand remains significantly higher than the summer lows (~114). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set to the same 3-period window to reflect current volatility as it transitions into the winter period.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Late-fall demand deceleration confirmed (P38-P40). Mean demand has dropped over three consecutive weeks from 288 to 216, averaging ~250 units/week, down from the October maintenance average of ~295.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25. We are in a post-peak Fall regime with a noticeable downward slope as we move towards late November. Demand for the last 4 periods (P38-P41) has been 288, 245, 216, and 241, averaging ~247 units/week. This is a clear step down from the October maintenance average of ~295. The most recent demand (241) shows a slight fluctuation but confirms the lower mean. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this deceleration. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the consistent 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current volatility in this deceleration phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Late-fall/Pre-winter demand stabilization confirmed. The last 4 periods (P38-P41) show a mean demand of 247.5 units/week, down from the October maintenance average of ~295.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive and unexpected demand spike to 447 units (Date: 2019/11/25). This aligns perfectly with 'Black Friday' retail timing (the Friday following the 4th Thursday of November), which resulted in a stockout as our previous parameters were set for a late-fall deceleration regime (~247 units). Given that the following week (the current Period 43, 2019/12/2) corresponds to Cyber Monday/Holiday shopping kick-off, we must anticipate continued elevated demand before the typical December decline. I am shifting the mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 280, which sits between the recent late-fall average and the pre-peak fall levels, as a 'cool-down' from the Black Friday peak while still protecting against holiday volume. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased volatility seen during these seasonal transitions. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Black Friday demand spike confirmed in Period 42 (447 units, +80% over recent mean). This signifies the start of the high-variance holiday retail window.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 42 (Nov 25) spiked to 447 units due to Black Friday, as correctly identified in the carry-over insights. However, demand in Period 43 (Dec 2) dropped significantly to 154 units, which is common in the post-Black Friday 'lull' before the final Christmas surge. Historically, in early December (Period 44 is Dec 9), demand begins to recover towards a holiday peak. Comparing this to the 'Late Fall maintenance' average of ~295 and the pre-Black Friday average of ~250, I anticipate a return to a more robust holiday level. Using a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat (covering the mix of pre-holiday, Black Friday, and the lull) targets a mean of approximately 268 units, which balances safety against the high variance seen in the last three weeks. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday demand lull confirmed in Period 43 (154 units, -65% from peak). Expected transition into late-December Christmas peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (2019/12/16), entering the week before Christmas. Historically, demand peaked for Black Friday (P42: 447), followed by a lull (P43: 154) and a slight recovery last week (P44: 214). For denim (curvy jeggings), we expect a secondary holiday peak this week as customers finish holiday shopping. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Based on the pattern of P43-P44 and the proximity to Christmas, I forecast a return to a high-maintenance level of approximately 280-300 units. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 290 to capture this expected pre-holiday lift. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the high volatility seen in the transition from Black Friday (P42) through the subsequent lull. This balances the risk of a festive stockout against the high holding cost of excess inventory heading into the post-holiday clearance period.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Entering pre-Christmas week. Expected demand lift from the post-Black Friday lull (P43-P44 mean: 184) toward a secondary seasonal peak (estimated 280-300 range) based on retail calendar knowledge for this product category.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019) is the week of Christmas. Demand has been trending upward sequentially following the post-Black Friday lull (154 -> 214 -> 258), confirming the pre-Christmas demand lift forecasted in previous periods. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0, the OR engine needs to cover demand for the current period. Based on the retail calendar for this product category (washed, superstretch denim), demand during the week of Christmas typically remains high due to late shoppers and the immediate start of post-holiday clearance/gift-card redemptions. I am setting mu_hat to 285 to reflect a continuation of the upward trend observed in Period 45 (258). I am setting sigma_hat to 55 to account for the high volatility characteristic of holiday retail weeks.

Carry-over insight: Christmas holiday demand confirmed: Period 45 demand increased to 258, continuing the 3-week upward trend from the post-Black Friday low (154 to 214 to 258). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3484.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas). Demand in Period 46 was 193, following the pre-Christmas lift of 258 in Period 45. This matches the expected pattern of a high pre-Christmas peak followed by a significant drop as the holiday shopping season concludes. Looking at historical data from similar transitions (e.g., post-Black Friday), demand dropped by approximately 65%. Given this is the final week of the year and transition into early January, demand is expected to decline further from the 190-250 range to a lower post-holiday maintenance level, likely returning to the 140-160 range seen in similar non-peak periods. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the most recent post-peak trend (avg: 221.7) but will apply a slight conservative buffer for the final period as we move into the January lull.

Carry-over insight: Post-Christmas demand decline confirmed: Period 46 demand (193) reflects a 25% drop from the Period 45 peak (258), signaling the end of the holiday shopping cycle.
