Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for high-waisted skinny denim trousers. Historical demand (5 samples) shows a clear upward trend: 0 -> 24 -> 29 -> 37 -> 41. The product description and date suggest a spring transition in the 'Divided' (fast-fashion, younger demographic) collection, where denim demand typically rises. Mean demand is currently around 34 units/period with a significant upward slope. Promised lead time is 0, but as we are just starting and observing a strong positive trend, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent growth while ignoring the initial 0 value. Since lead time is 0, mu_hat represents the demand for the current period. Choosing N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR engine on the active growth phase (Avg ~33), ensuring we stock enough to meet the rising demand while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation of ~7.5).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 (ordered 46, arrived 46 same period), which matches the promised lead time. The demand for Period 1 (37) aligns with the upward trend observed in the historical samples (0, 24, 29, 37, 41). The current demand regime appears to be averaging around 35-40 units per week. Given the date (Feb 18) and the product (High-waisted skinning denim), we are entering the spring fashion cycle where demand for jeans typically remains stable or increases. On-hand inventory is low (9 units), and there are no units in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent growth trend (29, 37, 41, 37) while maintaining the lead time at the promised 0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, and we are managing a pair of high-waisted skinny jeans (621381012). Historically, demand has been increasing (0 to 41 units in the initial samples). In Period 1, demand was 37. In Period 2, it jumped significantly to 58, leading to a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). This suggests a strong upward trend, likely due to spring seasonality for denim and 'Divided Collection' (youth/trend) items. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to capture the recent high demand (mu_hat) while increasing the buffer (sigma_hat) to prevent another stockout. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (capturing the 19-02-04 sample of 41, Period 1 demand of 37, and Period 2 demand of 58) to respond to the surge without being overly reactionary to a single spike. Sigma will also be based on these recent periods to reflect heightened volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand surging in February: avg transitioned from ~30 to ~58. Lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is jade green 'hard-worn' skinny denim from the Divided collection. Demand has entered a higher regime starting in February, with the last three periods showing demand of 37, 58, and 51 (average ~48.7). We have observed a confirmed lead time of 0 periods across three transitions (P1, P2, P3). On-hand inventory is currently 13. To manage the current demand levels, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (covering the high-demand periods in history plus the initial February spike). I will stick to the promised lead time (L=0) since it has consistently held.

Carry-over insight: Consistent demand regime established for early spring/February: average demand ~48 units per period. Actual lead time consistently 0 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a pair of high-waisted skinny jeans from the Divided collection. Analysis of the demand history (621381012) shows a clear shift in February: Period 1-4 demand values are 37, 58, 51, and 57, averaging 50.75 units. This is significantly higher than the initial January samples (avg ~26). This shift aligns with the transition from deep winter to early spring fashion cycles. The lead time (L) is consistently 0 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1 through 4. I will set L to 0 (explicitly to ensure backend doesn't over-calculate pipeline). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture this 'spring denim' regime (average ~51 across the last 4 weeks). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 4 weeks to capture current volatility. On-hand is low (6 units), so a full order for the upcoming week is necessary.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Reviewing the demand history since February (Period 1-5), the average demand has stabilized at approximately 49.4 units per period (37, 58, 51, 57, 44), which is significantly higher than the initial January samples. Although the latest demand (Period 5) was slightly lower at 44, the overall trend remains consistent with the established 'spring' regime. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all five concluded periods. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is maintained by the OR backend. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the stable February/March regime mean while allowing for the slight volatility seen in the weekly numbers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1095.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, and demand for these high-waisted skinny jeans (Divided collection) has remained strong through February and March. Looking at periods 1-6, the average demand is 50.8 units (37, 58, 51, 57, 44, 58), with a visible regime shift from the early January samples (averaging 26.2). The current regime length is 6 periods. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With stock-outs occurring in Period 2 and inventory ending very low (7 units) in Period 6, I need to ensure the base stock covers the mean demand plus a safety margin for the high demand volatility observed (std dev ~8.3 over the last 6 periods). Profit is $19 and Holding is $1, leading to a high target service level (q = 0.95), which the OR backend will calculate. Setting L to 'calculate' to lock in the 0-period lead time and using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the March demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed for March: average demand is 51 units (last 6 periods), showing sustained high interest compared to January/early February.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim TRS. Reviewing the history, the demand regime has shifted and stabilized since early February. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P1 to P7) is approximately 51.57 units (37, 58, 51, 57, 44, 58, 56). The actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all concluded transactions. With current on-hand inventory at 10 units and 0 in-transit, we need to ensure the base stock levels cover the expected demand for the current period. Given the stability of the 'Spring' demand regime observed throughout March, I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and variance compared to the initial January data.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. This SKU (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) is likely entering its peak spring season. Historical demand since Period 2 (early February) has been consistently strong, with recent demand over the last four periods averaging 54.5 units (44, 58, 56, 60). The most recent period (Period 8) saw a peak of 60 units. Based on this, I observe a slight upward trend as we move into April. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all concluded periods. I will use recent_N (set to 7) to capture the demand regime since mid-February, which effectively filters out the lower January samples while providing enough data to stabilize the sigma calculation. This covers the current demand level of ~51-60 units per period. The 0-period lead time remains stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for April: average demand increased to approximately 55 units over the last 4 periods (P5-P8), up from the ~48-51 average observed in February/March.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a pair of high-waisted skinny denim trousers, which typically sees stable demand in spring. Looking at the demand history since the shift in April (Period 7-9), demand was 56, 60, and 39. While P9 (39 units) was lower than the previous two weeks, the average of the last three periods is approximately 51.6 units. This aligns with the 'April regime' identified in previous insights but suggests a slight cooling or stabilization rather than a further surge. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use L=0. To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the end of March through April: 58, 56, 60, 39, and the P6 demand of 58) which results in an average demand of 54.2. This captures the recent higher volatility while smoothing the low outlier in P9. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the increased variance observed in the most recent period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing performance for SKU 621381012 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim), we observed a significant drop in demand over the last two periods (P9: 39 units, P10: 23 units). Previously, April was trending around 55-60 units. This decline suggests that the early spring peak for these hard-worn skinny jeans may be cooling off or transitioning into a late-spring/early-summer demand regime which is lower than the initial April surge. Lead time remains stable at 0. Because of the high inventory on hand (44 units) relative to the most recent demand (23 units), our order for P11 should be conservative to avoid excess holding costs while still covering the potential for a rebound. I will transition to a more reactive forecasting method using the last 3 samples to capture this recent downward trend and avoid over-ordering based on older, higher-demand data from March.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: Post-peak April demand falling; average dropped from ~55 to ~31 over the last two weeks (P9-P10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. We are observing a post-peak decline in demand for this SKU (skinny denim). Demand peaked in early April (reaching 60 units) but has since dropped significantly over the last three periods: 39, 23, and 34. This matches the 'Period 11' carry-over insight indicating a regime shift. The current demand regime (last 3 periods) has an average of approximately 32 units. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set L=0 explicitly to match observed history. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this lower demand level and avoid overstocking as the season winds down, while maintaining a buffer for the slight increase seen in Period 11 (34 units). Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this new regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' is exhibiting a clear post-peak decline. Demand peaked in early April (around 60 units) and has steadily decreased over the last four periods: 39, 23, 34, 26 (avg ~30.5). We are currently in May, moving further away from the spring shopping peak. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will prioritize the most recent 4 periods (N=4) for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture this new 'low' regime without being overly influenced by the historical April heights. Sigma will also be calculated over the same window to reflect recent volatility. This conservative stocking strategy aims to minimize holding costs as demand cools off.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for May: Average demand has stabilized around 30 units (observed P9-P12: 39, 23, 34, 26), down roughly 45% from the April peak of 55-60 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May. After a peak in April (avg ~55-60), demand for these skinny denim jeans has cooled significantly. The last five periods (P9-P13) show demand of 39, 23, 34, 26, 32, which averages approximately 30.8 units per period. The 'Period 13 conclude' message confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, which aligns with the promised lead time. I will maintain the L parameter at 0. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the May regime) to capture the current lower demand level of ~31 units. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current lower volatility. This setup ensures we maintain enough stock for a 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding excess inventory in a cooling market.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. We are observing the late-spring demand for 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim TRS' (High-waisted jeans). Last period (P14) saw a massive demand spike (73 units), which significantly exceeded the May average (~30 units) and even the April peak (~60 units). This resulted in a stockout (on-hand 0). While it could be an outlier, the spike of 73 might signal late-spring interest or a clearance-related boost. However, since we are moving further into late May, I will adjust the mu_hat to capture this recent volatility while respecting the previous regime. I will use recent_N with N=4 to weigh the recent spike (73) against the preceding lower demands (26, 32) to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture another high-demand week without overstocking if demand reverts to 30. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in mid-May (P14 demand: 73), breaking the previous stabilization around 30 units and causing a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1263.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for skinny denim trousers has shown a significant upward shift in late May, contrary to the earlier stabilization observed in mid-May. Period 14 (demand 73) and Period 15 (demand 67) both significantly exceed the prior 'May stabilization' average of ~30. This suggests a new demand regime or a seasonal late-spring peak. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (order arrives same period). Given the recent high volatility and demand surge, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the most recent regime shift (P13-P15), while setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time. This will raise the base stock level to account for the current higher demand and protect against potential stockouts observed in Period 14.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed for late May: Average demand increased to ~57 units (P13-P15 data: 32, 73, 67), up from the previously identified ~30 unit stabilization in early May.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand for this skinny denim product has shown distinct seasonal regimes: a spring peak in April (~55 units), a mid-May dip (~30 units), and a sharp late-May/early-June resurgence. Over the last three periods (P14-P16), demand has averaged 64 units (73, 67, 52), signaling a sustained high-demand period likely tied to summer seasonal transitions. Current on-hand inventory is 42 units. Actual lead time is confirmed consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this high-demand late-May/early-June regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, ensuring the base stock level remains high enough to capture the current momentum while the OR backend's inventory cap prevents excessive over-ordering as we move further into June.

Carry-over insight: High-demand June regime confirmed: Demand averaged 64 units over P14-P16, significantly exceeding the early May stabilization of 30 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (Denim Trousers) has entered a high-demand June regime. Period 17 saw a demand of 92 units, which resulted in a stockout (sold 82 with 0 ending inventory). Over the last four periods (P14-P17), demand has been 73, 67, 52, and 92, averaging 71 units per period. This is a significant increase from the May stabilization (approx. 30 units) and the April peak (approx. 55 units). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order placed in P17 arrived in P17). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility observed (std dev is approximately 17 over the last 4 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (recent_N=4) and use explicit sigma_hat. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat captures the current regime of ~71 units; I will set sigma_hat explicitly slightly higher than the recent sample standard deviation to ensure a sufficient safety stock buffer given the P17 spike.

Carry-over insight: June high-demand regime intensified: demand reached 92 units in P17, with a 4-period average (P14-P17) of 71 units, significantly higher than the previous 55-60 unit peak.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (Skinny Denim) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime in June, which likely corresponds to summer peaks for this product category. Demand in the most recent two periods (P17 and P18) was exactly 92 units each, suggesting a shift to a higher plateu compared to the mid-May average of ~60-70 units. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), the mean demand is 75.2 units with significant volatility (std ~18). The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this high-demand June regime (averaging 75.2 units per period), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen during this surge to ensure we avoid further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: June demand regime high: Demand has leveled at 92 units for two consecutive periods (P17-P18), with a 5-period average (P14-P18) of 75.2 units, significantly higher than the May peak of ~60 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (Denim TRS) is experiencing a severe demand surge coinciding with the peak of the summer season (late June). Demand has risen from ~52 (P16) to 92 (P17/18) and now 111 (P19), resulting in another stockout. The 3-period average (P17-P19) is 98.3 units, while the 5-period average (P15-P19) is 82.8. Given the clear upward trend, I will use recent_N=3 to set mu_hat, capturing the most recent intensification of the June peak. Combined with a lead time of 0 (confirmed consistently in history), this will allow the base-stock policy to target approximately 100-110 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensified in late June: average reached 98.3 units (P17-P19), up significantly from the mid-June average of 75.2. Sustained weekly increases (92, 92, 111) confirm a stronger seasonal peak than previously anticipated.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' has been highly volatile throughout June, peaking at 111 units in Period 19 before a sharp drop to 46 units in Period 20 (July 1st). This sharp drop suggests that the intensive late-June 'summer peak' may have subsided, or we are seeing a typical post-holiday/post-peak correction. The average demand across the last four periods is 85.25 units, while the average of the last three is 83 units. However, including the most recent low data point (46) significantly cools the forecast. Given the skinny denim product type, it remains a staple, but the clear seasonal spike seen in June is potentially cooling off. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the high average while factoring in the recent drop, and set sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (46 to 111 range). Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: The high-demand June peak (avg ~98) appears to have broken with a drop to 46 units on July 1st, suggesting a transition out of the peak summer buying period for this SKU.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' is currently in a transitional phase following a major summer peak in late June (where demand hit 111). The most recent demand figures are 46 (P20) and 72 (P21). While P20 suggested a potential crash, the rebound to 72 in P21 suggests demand is stabilizing at a lower 'post-peak' level rather than returning immediately to the May lows of ~30. The average of the last two periods (P20-P21) is 59 units. Given the transition, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (P19-P21) to capture the descent from the peak while respecting the resilient demand in P21. This results in a calculated mean of approximately 76.3. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. This approach maintains sufficient stock (on-hand 59) to cover the current period without over-committing as we move further into July.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak July demand stabilization: Demand has averaged 59 units over the last two periods (46, 72) following the June peak of 111, suggesting a new mid-summer regime higher than the early May average of 30.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the post-peak July period. Following the June demand peak (which reached 111 units), demand has transitioned to a new stabilization regime. Over the last three periods (P20-P22), demand has been 46, 72, and 67 units respectively. This averages to approximately 61.7 units. This is significantly higher than the May baseline of ~30, but well below the June peak of ~98. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sensitivity to mid-summer volatility (notably the jump back up to 72/67 from the 46 units seen in Period 20), I am using a recent_N strategy for both mean and variance. For mu_hat, N=3 captures the current July regime (avg 61.7). For sigma_hat, N=3 captures the current volatility in that transition (std dev approx 13.8). This will allow the OR engine to right-size the base stock for the current localized demand while keeping inventory levels manageable as the summer peak winds down.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak July demand regime confirmed: Average demand of 61.7 units (P20-P22: 46, 72, 67), establishing a stabilization point lower than June (~98) but significantly higher than early May (~30).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) experienced a significant demand spike in Period 23 (114 units), far exceeding the recent July stabilization average of ~61 units. This spike suggests a late-midsummer volatility or a second seasonal peak in July, similar to the pattern seen in late June. The SKU is currently stocked out (on-hand: 0). Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (~95%), necessitating a defensive inventory position to capture these spikes while the actual lead time remains 0. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this higher volatility and recent demand level by using the last 4 periods (P20-P23: 46, 72, 67, 114) which averages ~75 units, a 20% increase over the previous stabilization point. L remains 0 based on consistent historical evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike in late July: Demand reached 114 units in P23, breaking the previous post-peak stabilization of ~61.7 units. New 4-period average (P20-P23) is 74.75 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volatility summer demand phase (Late July). Recent demand shows a pattern of sharp spikes (P23: 114) followed by corrections (P24: 55). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24: 46, 72, 67, 114, 55) is 70.8 units, which is significantly higher than the early-summer stabilization of ~30-40 but lower than the June peak of ~98. Given the stockout in P23, I need to ensure the base stock covers the current volatility. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this post-peak July stabilization/volatility. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the recent high variance (standard deviation is high due to the 114 and 55 swing). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand volatility confirmed: Average demand of ~71 units (P20-P24) with significant variance (range 46-114), replacing the mid-July stabilization of 61.7.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). Historical demand for this skinny denim SKU shows significant volatility and shifts throughout the summer. After a late July spike (114 units), demand in the most recent two periods has settled between 55 and 73 units. The 'Carry-over Insights' track a transition from a June peak (~98 units) to a July stabilization (~71 units). Looking at the last 6 periods (P20 to P25), demand values are 46, 72, 67, 114, 55, and 73, yielding an average of approximately 71 units. Given that August often sees 'back-to-school' interest for denim, maintaining a baseline around this 71-unit mark is prudent. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean accurately while staying responsive to the latest regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical demand for this skinny denim SKU shows significant volatility and a possible late-summer peak, as evidenced by Period 26 demand hitting 116 units. The product is 'High-waisted jeans', which often see a 'Back to School' demand surge starting in mid-August. Recent demand (P23-P26: 114, 55, 73, 116) averages ~89.5 units, which is a substantial increase from the early July average of ~62. I will set mu_hat to reflect this higher late-summer/pre-autumn regime using the average of these last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the trend while accommodating the high variance. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'arrived=ordered' same-period history. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 will also capture the recent volatility (ranging from 55 to 116) to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent another stockout as seen in Period 26.

Carry-over insight: August demand surge confirmed: Period 26 demand (116) and recent 4-period average (~90) indicate a late-summer/Back-to-School regime shift from the July stabilization of ~62.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 621381012 (High-waisted skinny jeans) has spiked significantly in mid-August, reaching 173 units in Period 27 (up from 116 in P26 and ~73 in P25). This aligns with the Back-to-School shopping season for denim/trousers. The recent 3-period average is 120.6 units, but the last observation (173) suggests the peak may still be intensifying or sustaining at a much higher level than the previous August surge estimate of 90. I will shift the mu_hat estimation to a more aggressive recent_N window (N=3) to focus on this immediate seasonal peak. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased volatility (116 to 173). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all history up to Period 27.

Carry-over insight: August Back-to-School peak intensified: Period 27 demand reached 173 units, pushing the 2-period average (P26-P27) to 144.5, significantly higher than the initial August surge estimate of 90.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final week of August (2019/8/26), which historically aligns with the peak of the 'Back-to-School' shopping season for denim. Demand has exhibited a massive surge over the last three periods: P26 (116), P27 (173), and P28 (194). This represents a clear regime shift compared to the July average of ~62-75. The 2-period average (P27-P28) is 183.5, and the 3-period average (P26-P28) is 161. Despite ordering 204 units in P28, we only have 10 units on-hand due to the 194 units sold. Given the peak timing, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this high-velocity regime while remaining responsive to the possibility of a plateau or slight drop as September nears. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School peak intensified further in late August: Demand reached 194 units (P28), with a 3-period average (P26-P28) of 161 units, confirming a highly aggressive seasonal regime compared to early August estimates.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September (2019/9/2), following a massive 'Back-to-School' peak in August where demand reached 194 units. In Period 29 (the last week of August), demand dropped to 150 units, signaling that the primary peak has passed. Historically, this product (skinny denim) saw significant shifts between months (e.g., April peak followed by a May drop, then a June surge). Given the 150-unit demand in Period 29, we are in a high-demand tail of the BTS season. I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to capture the current high but decelerating demand (mean of 173, 194, 150 is 172.3). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will also use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen during the peak, providing a safety buffer as demand stabilizes post-Labor Day.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School decline detected: Demand dropped from 194 (P28) to 150 (P29) as the SKU enters September, suggesting the peak has passed.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-September (2019-09-09). Historical demand shows a massive Back-to-School (BTS) peak in late August (P26-P28), reaching 194 units, followed by a slight dip to 150 (P29) and a surprising secondary surge back to 195 units in Period 30. This suggests that while the primary BTS peak may have shifted, demand remains extremely high and volatile as school seasons settle. Since lead time is consistently 0, the strategy is to maintain enough stock to cover this high-demand tail while being cautious of a potential rapid decline as September progresses. The average of the last 4 periods (P27-P30) is approximately 178 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current high state, as the earlier August estimates are no longer sufficient. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to account for the high variance (150-195 range) observed in this late-summer regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand remains high and volatile: demand surged back to 195 units in P30 after a dip to 150 in P29, maintaining a 4-period average of 178 units, significantly higher than the initial August surge estimate of 90.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-September (2019-09-16). After the aggressive Back-to-School peaks in late August and early September (reaching 194-195 units), demand has started to moderate but remains high. Period 31 demand was 156 units, following a volatile sequence of 194, 150, 195, 156. The average of the last 4 periods is 173.75 units. While the absolute peak (approx 195) may be passing, the 'secondary' plateau appears to be around 155-175 units. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current high-but-declining state. Lead time is consistently 0. Setting L to default (0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the recent high-volume volatility to prevent stockouts while demand stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand plateauing: after peaking at ~195 units (P28, P30), demand has stayed elevated with a 4-period average of 174 units (P28-P31: 194, 150, 195, 156), significantly higher than the July stabilization of ~71.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September (2019/9/23). Demand has stabilized at a high plateau following the Back-to-School peak. The last four periods (P29-P32) show demand of 150, 195, 156, and 148, averaging 162.25 units. This is a slight cooling from the late August peak (P28: 194, P30: 195) but remains significantly higher than the July stabilization (~71). Given the current on-hand inventory of 66 and a lead time of 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this current regime using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent stabilization while maintaining sufficient stock for the high volatility (sigma_hat) observed in this high-volume period.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand stabilization: Demand has averaged ~162 units over the last 4 periods (P29-P32), confirming a high-level plateau in September compared to the previous peak of ~195.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of September 30 (Period 34), we are exiting the peak Back-to-School season. The last observed demand (Period 33) was 219, which caused a stockout (sold 199/219). This surge contradicts the 'stabilization' noted in Period 33's carry-over and indicates high volatility at the end of the peak. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high stockout risk demonstrated in the previous period and the fact that we are moving deeper into autumn (where denim demand often remains strong), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering Periods 29-33: 150, 195, 156, 148, 219) which averages ~173.6. Using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat will capture the current high volatility (std dev of these 5 periods is ~29). This approach provides a safety buffer while we wait to see if demand begins a sustained seasonal decline in October.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Back-to-School peak concluded with high volatility; Period 33 demand spiked to 219 despite previous stabilization signals, resulting in a stockout.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. We are moving out of the peak Back-to-School season and into October. Historical demand over the last 6 periods (P29-P34) shows a high mean (avg: 166.7) but significant volatility (demand range 132-219). The most recent demand (P34) was 132, continuing the downward trend from the late September spike (P33: 219). This indicates a transition toward a post-peak autumn regime. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this cooling trend (average of P30-P34 is ~170) while providing enough safety stock to handle the high observed variance. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling detected in October: After the Back-to-School volatility (peaking at 219), demand in P34 dropped to 132, suggesting the start of an autumn stabilization regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1270.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-October, clearly past the Back-to-School and September peaks. Demand has dropped significantly from the ~160-200 range seen in late August/September down to 132 in P34 and 75 in P35. This confirms a cooling trend as we move into autumn. A new demand regime is forming. To avoid excessive holding costs on a high-inventory item (on-hand is 155), I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use recent_N with N=3 (P33-P35: 219, 132, 75) to capture this downward momentum while still respecting some recent volatility. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The goal is to let inventory levels naturally drift down to match the lower autumn demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand cooling confirmed: October demand (P34-P35) averaged 103.5 units, a ~36% drop from the September stabilization of ~162 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1118.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (2019/10/21). Analysis of demand from P34-P36 (132, 75, 69) confirms a significant cooling after the September Back-to-School peak (which averaged ~162). The most recent two periods (P35-P36) show an average demand of 72 units, which is a clear drop from the early October level of 132. We have 193 units on-hand, which is more than enough to cover demand for the next few periods if this declining trend continues. To avoid accumulating excess inventory and incurring high holding costs ($1/unit/period), I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to a recent 3-period average (P34-P36) which is approximately 92 units per period. Using recent_N=3 for sigma_hat will also better capture the current volatility of this new regime compared to the extreme highs of September. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late October demand cooling confirmed: Demand dropped from a September average of ~162 to a recent 3-period average of 92 (P34-P36), with the last two weeks stabilizing around 72 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1227.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October, and demand has clearly stabilized into an autumn cooling regime. Specifically, demand over the last three periods (P35-P37) has been remarkably consistent at 75, 69, and 71 units, respectively (average of 71.7). This follows the aggressive 'Back-to-School' peak in September where demand frequently exceeded 150-200 units. Given the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, the OR backend's default base stock calculation (which targets a high service level) would likely result in an order that bridges the gap between on-hand inventory (122) and the target. However, since current demand is ~72 and on-hand is 122, we already have sufficient stock. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this new stabilized cooling regime and ensure the system doesn't over-order based on the high-volume historical September data.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization confirmed: Following the October cooling, demand has settled at an average of ~72 units over the last three periods (P35-P37: 75, 69, 71), down from the September plateau of ~162 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized into an autumn/late-autumn regime following the aggressive Back-to-School (BTS) peak in August and September. Observations from the last four periods (P35-P38) show demand values of 75, 69, 71, and 82, resulting in a 4-period average of 74.25 units. This is a significant and sustained drop from the September stabilization level of ~162 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory has been drawn down purposefully after the BTS peak, with on-hand now at 40 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture this established autumn level, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility. This will signal the OR backend to order sufficiently to meet the current ~75 unit/week demand while avoiding the excess holding costs associated with the previous high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/November demand regime confirmed: Average demand of 74 units over P35-P38 (75, 69, 71, 82), down approximately 54% from the September plateau of ~162 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a late autumn regime following the aggressive September Back-to-School peak and the subsequent October cooling. Over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), demand has recorded 75, 69, 71, 82, and 53 units, resulting in a mean of 70.0. The most recent demand (P39) was 53, which is slightly below the recent average but consistent with the cooling trend. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable post-peak autumn behavior while moving past the high-volatility stockout events of September. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock to satisfy the current demand level (~70 units) without over-ordering into the late-year period where demand might continue to cool.

Carry-over insight: November demand stabilization confirmed: Average demand of 70 units over P35-P39, continuing the downswing from the September peak (~162) and October cooling (~92).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (P35-P40) has consistently stabilized after the Back-to-School peaks, with values of 75, 69, 71, 82, 53, and 54. This averages to approximately 67.3 units per period. The last two periods (P39-P40) show a slight cooling to an average of 53.5, but a 6-period window (N=6) captures the established post-peak stabilization regime more reliably. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels are healthy with 34 units on-hand. I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=6 to reflect this current autumn stabilization around 67-70 units, providing sufficient stock to cover demand while minimizing holding costs as the market cools further entering late November.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (2019/11/25), following a clear post-Back-to-School cooling and a subsequent autumn stabilization. Since Period 35, demand has settled into a lower regime, with the most recent six periods (P36-P41) showing demands of 69, 71, 82, 53, 54, and 46. This reflects a significant drop from the September peak (~162-219 units). The average demand over these last six periods is approximately 62.5 units, with a noticeable further softening in the last three weeks (average 51.0). Given the product is 'skinny denim' and we are approaching December, I anticipate stable to slightly declining demand before any potential holiday or winter clearance shifts. I am selecting N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-autumn stability while remaining responsive to the slight downward trend observed in the most recent three weeks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Late Autumn demand stabilization confirmed: Weekly demand has averaged 62.5 units over the last 6 periods (P36-P41), with the last 3 weeks showing a slightly lower average of 51.0 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable late-autumn regime. Period 42 demand saw a slight increase to 75 units, but the broader trend for November (P39-P42) shows an average demand of 57 units. Given the date is December 2nd, we are entering the holiday season, which may lead to higher demand volatility or a slight lift, though denim typically follows a steady pattern compared to seasonal gifts. Recent history (last 4 periods: 53, 54, 46, 75) suggests the previous stabilization estimate of ~51 units was slightly conservative. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current late-autumn/early-winter demand level while maintaining responsiveness to the recent upward tick. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early December demand regime: Average demand of 57 units over P39-P42, reflecting a slight stabilization above the early November dip.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-December (2019/12/9). Recent demand has been cooling from the autumn plateau, with the most recent sample (P43) hitting a low of 20 units. However, the last 4 periods (P40-P43) average 48.75 units, and historical data for late-winter/spring consistently shows base demand around 30-50 units. While demand dropped to 20 in the last period, this may be a weekly fluctuation rather than a permanent floor. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P39-P43) to capture the current late-autumn/early-winter level while smoothing the P43 dip. Lead time remains consistently 0. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current volatility (ranging from 20 to 75).

Carry-over insight: December demand deceleration: average demand dropped to ~49 units (P40-P43) from the November average of ~63 units, with a significant low of 20 units in P43.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (skinny denim trousers) is in a clear seasonal downswing as it enters mid-December. Looking at recent demand history from November through early December (P40-P44), demand has been 54, 46, 75, 20, 29. The most recent two weeks (20, 29) show a significant drop compared to the November average of ~60. This reflects typical retail patterns where demand for standard denim might dip before or during the holiday peak in favor of other categories, or simply a seasonal cooling. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this deceleration (average ~45 units). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrives same period), so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime shift: Demand has dropped and stabilized at a significantly lower level, averaging ~25 units over the last two periods (P43-P44), compared to the November average of ~58.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late December period (Christmas/New Year week). Recent demand analysis (P43-P45) shows a significant deceleration and stabilization at a lower level following the autumn cooling, with demand values of 20, 29, and 26. This results in a 3-period average of 25.0 units. Given the date (Dec 23), I anticipate this low-demand regime to persist through the holiday week. The on-hand inventory is 55 units, which already covers more than two periods of the current average demand. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the holiday period, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3-period regime (N=3) to reflect the stabilized mean of ~25 units. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the current lower volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent history.

Carry-over insight: December demand stabilization: Demand has further dropped from the November average (~58) to a new low-level regime of ~25 units (average of 25.0 over P43-P45).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Historical demand for this SKU shows a significant low-level stabilization in December. Over the last four periods (P43-P46), demand has been 20, 29, 26, and 27, resulting in a stable mean of approximately 25.5 units. This is a sharp decline from the November average of ~58. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Based on this established December regime, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this holiday-season low and avoid over-ordering based on the high-demand peaks earlier in the year. The current on-hand inventory is 28 units, which nearly covers the expected demand for the coming period (avg ~25.5), so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order or none to maintain the base stock level.
