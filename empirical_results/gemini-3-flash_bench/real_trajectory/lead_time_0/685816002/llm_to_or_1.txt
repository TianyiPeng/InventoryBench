Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 685816002 (Men's Cotton T-shirt). The history shows 5 data points with a mean of 66.2 and a standard deviation of 8.87. There is no significant trend or seasonality visible yet in the early-year data. Since the promised lead time is 0 and we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to establish an initial stock position to cover the current period's demand (which occurs after our decision). I will use the 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which leverage the available historical sample statistics to set the base stock level. The backend will calculate L+1 periods of demand coverage (where L=0, so 1 period).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 96 units, which exceeded the historical mean (approx 66) and our initial on-hand inventory (74). This resulted in a total stockout (ending inventory 0). The item is a 'Jersey Basic' round-necked T-shirt, which serves as a staple item. Current date is mid-February, transitioning from winter towards spring demand. Given that demand spiked significantly above the 5-week historical sample average of 66.2, I will transition to using a recent window (N=5 from the provided history + 1 observed period) to better capture this upward trend while maintaining stability. The actual lead time was confirmed as 0 in Period 1, matching the promised lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a basic cotton T-shirt, which typically has stable demand. However, historical demand (P1: 96, P2: 102) is significantly higher than the training data average (2019-01 samples: ~66). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on P1 and P2 arrivals. In both P1 and P2, we stocked out (ending inventory 0) because demand exceeded our base stock, which was likely throttled by the OR engine's default settings and the low-variance training data. To capture the full demand and avoid further lost sales, I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 to reflect the recent high-demand regime (avg ~99). This will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to better align with actual observed needs rather than the older, lower demand figures.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting 2019-02-11: avg increased from ~66 to ~99 (+50%) across 2 periods. Lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). Analysis of the last three periods (P1-P3) shows a significant demand surge for this men's jersey t-shirt compared to the initial 5 weeks of history (avg ~66). The demand in P1, P2, and P3 was 96, 102, and 119 respectively, averaging ~106. This confirms the previously noted regime shift and indicates it is potentially still accelerating. Despite increasing order quantities, ending inventory has been 0 for three consecutive periods, meaning we are underordering and losing potential sales. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To capture this higher demand and stop stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the new regime (mu ~106, sigma ~12). This will set a higher base stock to satisfy the current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P1-P3 average demand is 105.7 (+60% vs initial history). 100% stockout rate observed in P1-P3 due to underestimation of this shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P1-P4) shows a significant shift compared to the pre-game baseline. The demand values were 96, 102, 119, and 82, with an average of 99.75. This confirms the earlier insight that demand has stabilized at a higher level (~100 units/period) than the initial history (~66 units/period). Periods 1-3 were characterized by stockouts, but Period 4 finally satisfied all demand (82) with an ending inventory of 34 units. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the lower demand observed in P4 (82) vs P3 (119), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime. This will set mu_hat based on the (1+L) mean of ~100. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility of this new regime which includes the P3 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: P1-P4 average is 99.75 (+51% vs initial baseline). Stockout cycle broken in P4. Lead time consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $212.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (Men's Cotton T-shirt) experienced a significant demand spike in Periods 1-3 (averaging 105.7 units), likely representing a seasonal shift or promotion. However, demand has cooled in the last two periods (Period 4: 82, Period 5: 65), bringing the recent average (N=5) to 92.8. The current date is March 18, 2019. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all 5 completed periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 48 units and demand appears to be returning toward the baseline (historical mean was ~66, recent periods 4-5 average is 73.5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the elevated but decelerating demand trend. This prevents over-ordering as the 'spike' recedes while maintaining enough safety stock. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to account for the high volatility seen during the transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak has passed: demand decreased from an average of ~106 (P1-P3) to ~74 (P4-P5), a 30% reduction from the peak but still 12% above the initial pre-game baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $169.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7 (2019-03-25), the product (Ronny Reg RN T-Shirt) continues its downward demand trend from a late February peak. The demand in Period 6 was 56, which is lower than the initial baseline (avg ~66) and significantly lower than the P1-P3 peak (avg ~106). We are currently in a post-peak stabilization or decay phase. The lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With 55 units on-hand and declining demand, the OR engine needs to adjust to a lower mean to avoid excessive holding costs. Using recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the recent lower demand levels (82, 65, 56) while ignoring the now-irrelevant peak. L is set to default as the confirmed lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-peak stabilization confirmed. Demand average has dropped from ~106 (P1-P3) to ~68 (P4-P6), which is now aligning with the pre-game baseline (~66).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (Men's Basic Jersey T-shirt) has moved past its February peak (avg demand ~106) and has stabilized over the last 4 periods (P4-P7) around a mean of 66.25 units, which aligns closely with the initial pre-game baseline (avg 64.2). Period 7 demand was 62. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory has been successfully drawn down from high levels to 17 units. For Period 8, a stable regime is detected. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this post-peak stabilization (P4-P7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects current lower demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (62-82 range in the recent regime).

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), demand unexpectedly spiked to 128 units, resulting in a stockout (76 sold vs 128 demand). This spike occurred just as demand seemed to have stabilized near the pre-game baseline (~66 units). Calendar analysis suggests this surge may be related to early spring demand or pre-Easter shopping (Easter was April 21 in 2019). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and prepare for potential sustained higher demand without over-committing to the 128 spike, I will use a balanced EWMA for mu_hat with gamma=0.5. This allows the model to respond to the recent spike while maintaining memory of the lower preceding periods. Sigma_hat is set to the most recent 3 periods to capture the recent volatility increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike on 2019-04-01: demand jumped to 128 units after 4 periods of averaging ~66. This caused a total stockout in Period 8.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 685816002 shows a significant spike in Period 8 (128 units) followed by Period 9 (100 units). This suggests we are in a new high-demand regime similar to the start of the simulation (Periods 1-3), possibly driven by early spring/Easter seasonality given the mid-April date (2019-04-15). The average demand over the last 2 periods is 114 units, whereas the previous 'stable' period (P4-P7) averaged 66.25 units. Since lead time is consistently 0, we must ensure each order covers the current period's demand. To capture this recent surge without overreacting to a single spike, I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set mu_hat at approximately (1+0)*114, which should provide enough stock to cover the manifest demand shift while maintaining a safe buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime identified starting Period 8: Avg demand increased from ~66 (P4-P7) to ~114 (P8-P9), a +72% increase. This mirrors the early-game peak and suggests seasonal or promotional cyclicality.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 685816002 (Men's Cotton T-shirt) has entered its second high-demand regime of the game. After an initial spike in February (P1-P3, avg ~106), demand stabilized in March (P4-P7, avg ~66), but surged again in April starting with Period 8. The demand in the last three periods (P8-P10) was 128, 100, and 90, respectively. This gives a recent 3-period average of 106.0, which aligns almost perfectly with the peak seen in February. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same cycle. To manage this recent high-volatility regime (\u03c3\u224819.7 over the last 3 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3. This ensures the OR engine computes a base stock sufficient to cover the current 100+ unit demand level while accounting for the high localized variance, preventing the stockouts observed in Period 8.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 is experiencing a significant high-demand regime that began around Period 8 (Date 2019-04-01). The most recent demand (Period 11) spiked to 158 units, causing a stockout of the 123 available units. Over the last 4 periods (P8-P11), demand has averaged 119 units (128, 100, 90, 158), which is significantly higher than the baseline. Lead time is reliably 0. I will set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-volatility, high-demand state while ensuring the OR engine targets a high service level due to the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio. On-hand inventory is currently 0, so the backend needs to re-establish safety stock immediately.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (Period 8-11): Average demand increased to 119 units (+80% vs baseline), with high volatility (std dev ~31).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '685816002' (Men's Cotton T-shirt) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in Period 8. Historical demand for the last five periods (P8-P12) is: 128, 100, 90, 158, 129, resulting in a mean of 121.0 units per period. This regime corresponds with the spring season (April/May), which typically sees increased demand for basic jersey items. Despite placing a large order in Period 12, the high demand (129) left only 16 units on hand. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level for this high-margin item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (P8-P12) to capture the current mean (121) and volatility (std dev approx 26.5) of this regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the current high-demand environment and helps prevent the stockouts observed in P8 and P11.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (Cotton T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 8. The demand average from Period 8 to Period 13 is 115.8 units, which is significantly higher than the initial baseline (approx. 66) and the mid-game dip (approx. 68). The demand in Period 13 dropped to 90 units, suggesting the peak of this wave might be passing, but volatility remains high (StdDev ~25.9 over the last 6 periods). Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this current high-demand regime while allowing for the slight cooling observed in the latest period. Sigma_hat is also set using N=6 to account for the increased volatility (ranging from 90 to 158) during this phase. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the current demand level without overreacting to the single lower point in Period 13.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (Cotton T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 8 (early April). The demand from Period 8 to Period 14 has averaged 118.3 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline (~66) and the mid-game slump. Specifically, the last four periods (P11-P14) have seen demand of 158, 129, 90, and 133, maintaining a high average of 127.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 28. This suggests a seasonal peak as we enter the warmer spring/summer months. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (covering the entire high-demand regime from P8-P14) to capture the current mean of ~118, and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the recent high volatility (std dev ~28) observed in the last four weeks. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for both the sustained high demand and the significant week-to-week fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Established high-demand regime (Period 8-14): Mean demand is 118.3 units (+79% vs baseline) with high volatility (std dev ~28). This matches seasonal expectations for cotton t-shirts in late spring.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (Cotton T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 8 (late spring). Period 15 showed a demand of 148, which exceeded the existing on-hand inventory, leading to a stockout. The average demand from Period 8 to Period 15 is approximately 121.8 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~66. Standard deviation during this high-demand window is approximately 23.9. Given we are in late May (Period 16), sustained high demand for cotton t-shirts is expected to continue through the summer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this specific high-demand regime (Period 8 to 15) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently 0, so I will continue using the 'default' method.

Carry-over insight: Established high-demand regime (Period 8-15): Mean demand increased to 121.8 units (+84% vs baseline) with significant volatility (std dev ~24). Stockouts occurred in P8, P11, and P15 due to demand spikes above forecast.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (Cotton T-shirt) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime, likely driven by seasonal summer demand. Period 16 recorded the highest demand yet (175 units), leading to a total stockout and lost sales (sold 144 vs demand 175). Comparing the recent high-demand period (P8-P16) to the baseline, the mean demand is 116.89 with a significant standard deviation of 30.6. Specifically, over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), the mean has increased to 135.0 units with a standard deviation of 31.3. Given the stockout in P16 and the upward trend, I will use recent_N with N=9 (covering the start of the current high-demand regime from P8-P16) to capture the elevated mean while allowing the standard deviation to cover the observed volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensified in late May (Period 16): demand reached a series peak of 175 units. High-demand regime (P8-P16) now averages 117 units, but the most recent 5-period average (P12-P16) has risen to 135 units, indicating a potential secondary upward shift within the summer season.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (cotton t-shirt) is in a peak summer demand regime. Demand has intensified significantly over the last three periods (P15-P17 showing 148, 175, 158 units respectively), resulting in consecutive stockouts despite aggressive ordering. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 141 units, but the most recent 3 periods average 160 units. Given the seasonal nature and current June date, demand is likely to remain at this elevated level or continue to climb slightly. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($4 vs $1 holding cost), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this latest surge (160 units per period). I will set sigma_hat to explicit=30 to account for high volatility observed during these spikes (e.g., jump from 133 to 175). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand surge within summer season (Period 15-17): average demand increased to 160 units (+140% vs baseline, +35% vs mid-spring regime). Consecutive stockouts in P15, P16, and P17.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (Cotton T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Period 18 demand was 117, following a peak of 175 and 158 in Periods 16 and 17. The recent surge (Periods 15-18) shows an average demand of 149.5 units, which is a significant increase over the previous spring high-demand regime (~120). Although Period 18 saw a slight cooling (117), demand remains volatile and seasonally high for mid-June. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this latest summer surge (Periods 15-18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand surge (Period 15-18) average demand confirmed at 149.5 units (+25% vs spring high-demand regime).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 20 (June 24, 2019), the product is in a peak summer demand regime. Since Period 15 (mid-May), demand has consistently spiked, averaging 142.4 units per period (P15-P19), which is a significant increase from the previous spring regime (~118 units). In the most recent two periods (P18-P19), demand has slightly moderated to 115.5 units, but remains high. Given the summer season for cotton t-shirts, I will focus on the most recent 5-period window (P15-P19) to set mu_hat, as this captures the current high-demand season while smoothing the extreme volatility seen in P16-P17. The lead time remains consistently 0. Using recent_N for both mean and volatility ensures the OR engine reacts to the current high-base, high-variance environment without being over-influenced by the earlier, much lower pre-spring data.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (Period 15-19) confirmed: average demand is 142.4 units, representing a 115% increase over the initial pre-game baseline (~66) and a 20% increase over the mid-spring regime (~118).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. Historical data for this soft cotton t-shirt shows a clear late-spring/summer demand surge. The period from P15 to P20 (late May through June) has seen an average demand of 148.5 units (148, 175, 158, 117, 114, 179). Period 20 ended in a stockout (demand 179 vs 165 available), confirming that we are still in a peak demand regime. The most recent demand (179) indicates that volatility remains high and the summer peak is likely to continue through July. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods. To maximize profit and avoid the recurring stockouts observed in P15-P17 and P20, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (P15-P20) to capture this specific high-demand summer regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent average of ~149 units and the significant volatility (std dev ~27) to maintain a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (Period 15-20) confirmed: average demand is 148.5 units with high volatility. July 1st starts with 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 20.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 is currently in its summer peak demand regime (July). Demand in Period 21 was 137 units, following a peak of 179 in Period 20. The summer regime (P15-P21) has an average demand of approximately 146.8 units (148, 175, 158, 117, 114, 179, 137). Since we are currently in July, high demand for cotton t-shirts is expected to persist. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use the recent N=7 (the current summer regime length) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume period specifically, ensuring sufficient inventory to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 15, 16, 17, and 20. The current on-hand inventory is 36 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the middle of the summer peak for cotton t-shirts. The demand regime starting from Period 15 (May 20) has shown sustained high demand, though it has stabilized slightly from its absolute peak (175, 179). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P15-P22) is approximately 140.7 units. The last two periods (P21-P22) show a slight cooling to 137 and 118, respectively, but remaining significantly above the spring regime (~118) and the early-year baseline (~66). I will use a recent_N approach with N=8 to capture the current summer demand regime (average ~141, std dev ~24). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrival in the same period), so L is set to default (0). With profit=4 and holding=1, the service level q = 4/5 = 0.80, which is handled by the OR backend. Base stock will target ~141 units + safety stock to cover the high summer volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic Round-necked T-shirt', which is a quintessential summer staple. We are currently in late July (Period 24). Historical demand analysis shows a significant surge during the transition from spring to summer, peaking in June (Periods 16-20). The most recent three periods (P21-P23) show a slight cooling from those peak levels, with demand at 137, 118, and 102 units. This indicates the primary summer peak has passed, and we are entering a late-summer stabilization phase. The current inventory (64 units) is moderate. The lead time remains consistently 0. To prevent excessive holding costs as the season eventually turns, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the end of the peak and the start of the current stabilization: ~129 units) and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent moderate volatility (std dev ~30). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 130-150 units needed for current demand while respecting the high critical ratio (0.8) for this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak stabilization observed starting Period 21: average demand has moderated to ~119 units (P21-P23) from the peak average of ~150 units (P15-P20).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 685816002 (cotton T-shirt) shows a clear seasonal peak in May and June (averaging ~140-160 units), followed by a cooling-off period in July. Demand in the most recent four periods (P21-P24) has been 137, 118, 102, and 82, showing a consistent downward trend as mid-summer passes. The average demand for these last 4 periods is ~110 units, but the most recent figure (82) suggests further deceleration towards the pre-peak baseline. I will use a N=4 window for the mean (mu_hat) to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining enough safety stock to prevent stockouts, as volatility remains present. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets an 80% service level; using recent volatility (N=4) for sigma_hat will help calibrate the stock levels to the current moderating demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~148 (P15-P20) to ~110 (P21-P24), with the most recent period (P24) falling to 82 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a cotton t-shirt, exhibiting strong seasonality. After a summer peak that reached ~150 units/period (P15-P20), demand has significantly cooled in late July/early August. The last five periods (P21-P25) show a downward trend: 137, 118, 102, 82, 56. The most recent period (P25) recorded 56 units, which is below the initial pre-game baseline of ~66. This indicates a seasonal transition from summer to late summer/early autumn. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this deceleration. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game, so L is set to 'calculate' to reflect historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer seasonal decline confirmed: Demand decreased incrementally from 137 (P21) to 56 (P25), an average of ~99 units across P21-P25. This marks a ~33% drop from the summer peak average (~148).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 is a cotton t-shirt, which has moved past its summer peak (P15-P20 avg ~148) into a late-summer/early-autumn deceleration phase. Demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) has averaged 96.1 units, significantly lower than the summer peak but showing some stabilization around the 80-unit mark in the most recent periods (P24 and P26 demand was 82; P25 was 56). Given the consistent lead time of 0 periods, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for the moderate volatility observed during this transition. Setting N=6 for mu_hat captures the post-peak average (~96), which prevents over-ordering as seasonality shifts away from summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed (Periods 21-26): Demand average is 96.1 units, a ~35% decrease from the summer peak average of 148.5 units. Recent demand (P24-P26) suggests a secondary floor around 75-85 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-19. We are observing the late summer/early fall transition for the 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT'. Since Period 21, demand has exited its peak summer regime (~150 units) and settled into a lower stabilization phase. The last 6 periods (P22-P27) have shown demand values of 118, 102, 82, 56, 82, and 108. This averages to 91.3 units, significantly lower than the summer peak but still higher than the initial pre-game baseline (~66). The recent demand uptick to 108 in Period 27 suggests that while the peak is over, demand is not collapsing yet. Inferred lead time remains 0 based on every concluded period in history. Given the shift toward a more stable late-season demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering P21-P27) to capture the post-peak trend while maintaining enough sensitivity to the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization (Period 21-27) confirmed: Average demand is approximately 98 units, a ~34% decline from the summer peak average of 148.5 units. Volatility remains present with a range of 56 to 137 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Demand for the cotton t-shirt (685816002) is currently in a post-summer stabilization phase. While there was a significant drop from the summer peak (~150 units), the last two periods (P27 and P28) have shown a slight upward tick to 108 and 115 units respectively, deviating from the 'floor' of 56-82 units observed between P24-P26. This suggests that while the summer peak is over, demand has settled at a higher level than the initial baseline (~66). The mean demand over the last 8 periods (P21-P28, the post-peak era) is approximately 100 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will use recent_N=8 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility, ensuring we cover the recent minor increase without overreacting to the mid-summer extremes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (Cotton Round-necked T-shirt) is currently in a transitional phase following its summer peak. The period is now early September (2019-09-02). Demand in the last 6 periods (P24-P29) has averaged approximately 90 units (82, 56, 82, 108, 115, 96), indicating a stabilization noticeably below the summer peak of ~148 but above the early spring baseline of ~66. This suggests an 'Autumn' regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To balance the service level (Profit $4 vs Holding $1 implies a high target service level ~80%) against holding costs, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining responsive volatility coverage. Setting L to 0 based on consistent historical observation.

Carry-over insight: Autumn stabilization confirmed starting Period 24: average demand is ~90 units, approximately 35% above the initial pre-game baseline but 39% below the summer peak average.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand phase for this cotton t-shirt. Since Period 21 (July 1st), demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the summer peak. Analyzing the most recent sequence (Periods 24-30), demand has averaged 90.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18.7. The last three periods (P28-P30) specifically averaged 101.6 units, indicating a possible minor plateau or high-volatility stabilization as autumn begins. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To balance the service level against holding costs ($1/unit/period) given a profit of $4/unit, I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (P24-P30) to capture the current autumn stabilization regime while accounting for recent volatility in the sigma_hat calculation.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in an 'Autumn stabilization' regime for this cotton round-neck T-shirt. Historically, demand for this item peaked in the summer (June-July) averaging ~148 units and has since decelerated. Across the most recent 8 periods (P24-P31), the average demand is 91.6 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of demand stabilizing around 90 units (approx. 35% above the initial pre-game baseline of 66). Period 31 demand was 79, continuing a slight downward drift typical of post-summer seasonality for basic t-shirts. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To balance the relatively high service level requirement (profit $4 vs holding $1) while accounting for the recent stabilization, I will use a recent_N method with N=8 to capture this entire autumn regime (P24-P31). This N provides a stable mean of ~92 and captures the observed variance (std dev ~18) to protect against stockouts while preventing excessive holding costs as demand potentially trends further downward toward the winter baseline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (Period 24-31) confirmed: average demand is 91.6 units (std dev 18.5). This represents a 38% decrease from the summer peak average of 148.5 units, but remains 39% above the initial pre-game baseline of 66 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 is currently in an autumn stabilization phase (Period 33, Late September). Since Period 24 (late July), demand has moderated significantly from the summer peak (~148) to an average of approximately 90 units. The most recent three periods (P30-P32) show demand of 94, 79, and 59, indicating a potential further downward trend as we move deeper into autumn. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this gradual seasonal decline while maintaining a sufficient service level (profit/holding cost ratio suggests a high service level requirement), I will use the recent regime (P24-P32, N=9) for forecasting mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the ~90 unit average while acknowledging the volatility observed during this stabilization period (std dev ~18.5). Current on-hand inventory is 46, which is below the expected demand for the upcoming period, necessitating a replenishment order.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (Cotton T-shirt) experienced a demand spike in Period 33 (117 units), resulting in a stockout. This spike follows a period of autumn stabilization where demand averaged ~91 units (P24-P32). Historically, this SKU shows significant volatility and recurring spikes (e.g., Period 8, Period 11, Period 16, Period 20). Given the stockout in Period 33 and the transition into late September/October, I need to replenish inventory to meet this higher demand level while accounting for the established volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current autumn demand regime (avg ~94) including the recent spike, which provides a safer base stock calculation compared to the longer-term average. This choice balances the risk of further stockouts against the holding cost of $1.0.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-10-07. We are in an autumn demand regime that stabilized around Period 24. Since Period 24, demand has averaged 90.7 units (n=11, periods 24-34), with a slight increase in volatility lately (demand of 117 and 100 in the last two periods). Carrying 7 units on-hand, the OR backend needs to cover the next period's demand (L=0). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the autumn regime mean (~91 units) and N=11 for sigma_hat to reflect the observed variability in this specific regime. This helps the backend set a base stock that accounts for the current post-summer stabilization while protecting against the recent minor spikes in demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (Cotton T-shirt) is currently in an autumn stabilization phase following its summer peak. In the most recent period (P35), demand was 92 units. The average demand over the last 12 periods (P24-P35) is 89.25 units, which aligns with previous insights indicating an autumn stabilization around 90 units. Demand remains volatile but steady for this season. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period inventory replenishment. Given the current date (mid-October) and the product type (basic underwear/t-shirt), demand is expected to remain relatively stable or slightly decline as we move away from summer. Using a recent_N window of 12 periods for mu_hat captures this current floor and volatility better than the full history or short-term noise. For sigma_hat, a larger window (N=20) is chosen to account for the high historical volatility observed throughout the summer-to-autumn transition, ensuring a robust safety stock against spikes like those seen in P33 (117 units).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-10-21. We are in the late autumn season for a cotton t-shirt SKU. Recent demand history shows a significant drop in Period 36 to 33 units, following a stable autumn regime. Calculating the average demand from the most recent period of stability (Period 33-36) gives approximately 85.5 units. However, the drop in P36 is likely a signal of a seasonal cooling off or a specific outlier. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current autumn mean while allowing the logic to gracefully handle the recent dip. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The base stock level needs to balance a high service level (profit $4 vs holding cost $1) against this recent downward volatility. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=4 to reflect the late autumn average (approx 85.5 per period), and sigma_hat will also use N=4 to account for the increased variance seen between the 117 unit peak in P33 and the 33 unit low in P36.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand deceleration observed: Period 36 demand dropped to 33 units, contributing to a 4-period average (P33-P36) of 85.5 units, down from the earlier autumn average of 91.6 units (P24-P31).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in a late autumn phase for this cotton t-shirt product. Historical demand has transitioned from a summer peak (avg ~148) to an autumn stabilization (avg ~91, P24-P31), and recently shows signs of further deceleration as we move towards winter. Demand in the last two periods was significantly lower (33 and 51 units). The most recent 5-period average (P33-P37) is 78.6 units, but the last 2 periods specifically average 42 units. Given the seasonal nature of a 'soft cotton jersey t-shirt', a decline in late October is expected. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the volatility seen in Period 33 (117 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand deceleration confirmed (starting Period 36): Last 2 periods (P36-P37) show mean demand of 42 units, a 54% drop from the early autumn average (~91).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 685816002 (cotton t-shirt) is exhibiting a clear late-autumn seasonal decline as of November 2019. The mean demand over the last 3 periods (P36-P38) is 50.6 units, a significant drop from the early autumn average of ~91 units. Following the carry-over insight from Period 38, which noted a shift starting P36, the current observation confirms this lower regime. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) captures this latest deceleration most accurately while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility within this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (Period 36-38) confirmed: average demand dropped to 50.7 units, down 45% from the early autumn average (~91).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-November. Historically, this product (cotton t-shirt) saw its lowest demand around the initial pre-game baseline (P1-P5) and the recent October periods. Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn level. Period 39 demand was 63 units, and the 4-period average (P36-P39) is 53.75 units. Given the transition into late autumn/early winter for a basic jersey t-shirt, demand is expected to remain around this lower floor of 50-60 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (HoldingCost=$1.0 vs Profit=$4.0) while maintaining a sufficient service level for this lower-demand regime, I will use a recent 4-period window (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current 54-unit average rather than the higher autumn or summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (Period 36-39) confirmed: average demand is 53.8 units, a 41% decrease from the early autumn average (~91).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November), and the product 'RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT' is in a late-autumn/winter cooling phase. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 36. The average demand for the last five periods (P36-P40) is 52.6 units (33, 51, 68, 63, 48), which represents a significant drop from the autumn average of ~91 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 19 units on hand. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for Period 41. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as it captures the current stabilized low-demand regime while allowing for the volatility (range 33-68) observed in the last five weeks. This will prevent overstocking during the off-season while maintaining a service level that avoids stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (Period 36-40) confirmed: average demand is 52.6 units, reflecting a 42% decrease from the early autumn average (~91) and returning closer to the pre-game baseline (~66).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a late-autumn demand regime that began around Period 36. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P36-P41) is 53.0 units (33, 51, 68, 63, 48, 55). This is significantly lower than the autumn average (~91) and closer to the pre-game baseline (~66). Although we are approaching late November (Black Friday/Cyber Monday), the product is 'Men Underwear | Jersey Basic', which typically sees stable or slightly elevated demand rather than massive holiday spikes compared to fashion items, but we must remain cautious of a potential holiday bump. I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 to capture this current late-autumn mean and variance. This provides a mu_hat of ~53 and sufficient sigma to handle the moderate volatility (std dev ~12) observed in this regime. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (2019/11/25), demand spiked significantly to 207 units, causing a complete stockout. This timing aligns perfectly with 'Black Friday' retail trends, which often result in massive demand surges for basic apparel like cotton t-shirts. However, demand typically drops back toward the seasonal baseline immediately following this peak. The late-autumn baseline (P36-P41) was approximately 53 units. Given the transition into early December, I will set mu_hat to reflect a return to the pre-spike level while acknowledging recent volatility. I choose an explicit mu_hat of 65 (slightly above the late-autumn mean to provide safety buffer) and an explicit sigma_hat of 40 to account for the high residual variance from the Black Friday spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday demand spike confirmed on 2019-11-25 (Period 42): demand reached 207 units, 4x higher than the late-autumn average (53 units).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (2019/12/09), following the massive Black Friday spike in Period 42 (Nov 25th). The most recent demand in Period 43 was 64 units, which aligns closely with the pre-holiday 'late-autumn' regime of approximately 50-55 units. Historically, we saw a demand surge in mid-December (Period 1 was mid-Feb, so looking back at the provided pre-game data and the cyclical nature of retail), but the primary concern now is Christmas and end-of-year sales. Given the 'Men Underwear/Jersey Basic' description, these are common gifts. In Period 1 (mid-Feb 2019), demand was 96. I anticipate a modest holiday lift in the next 1-2 periods before the game ends at Period 47. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to include the post-peak normalization while giving weight to the holiday-adjacent periods. Sigma_hat is set via 'recent_N' with N=8 to better capture the volatility seen during the transition from the Black Friday spike back to baseline. Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand normalization: Period 43 demand (64) indicates a return toward the late-autumn baseline (~53), but remains slightly elevated which may suggest the start of holiday shopping activity.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019, which is in the heart of the holiday shopping season. Following the Black Friday spike (P42: 207 units), demand has stabilized at an elevated level (P43: 64, P44: 80) compared to the late-autumn baseline (~53). This suggests a 'Holiday Season' regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this holiday elevated demand while accounting for potential pre-Christmas surges, I will use a 'recent_N' approach focusing on the last 3 periods (P42-P44) to calculate mu_hat, which averages ~117 units. This provides a buffer for higher volume weeks leading into late December. Sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 3 periods to account for the high volatility introduced by the Black Friday peak, ensuring sufficient safety stock for the end-of-year rush.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (starting P43): Post-Black Friday demand is averaging ~72 units (+36% vs late-autumn baseline), indicating sustained holiday shopping activity.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the holiday shopping season (Period 46, Dec 23). Historical data from Period 43 to 45 shows a 'Holiday demand regime' with an average demand of approximately 82.7 units (64, 80, 104), which is a clear increase from the late-autumn baseline of ~53 units. The most recent demand (P45) spiked to 104 units, the highest in this regime, consistent with pre-Christmas shopping peaks. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this upward trend while ensuring adequate service levels for potential late-season spikes or post-holiday returns, I will use a recent_N window (N=3) to focus on the active holiday regime. This will set mu_hat based on the average of (64, 80, 104), and sigma_hat based on the localized volatility of these fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (starting P43) peak confirmed: P45 demand reached 104 units. Regime average (P43-P45) is 82.7 units (+57% vs late-autumn baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $190.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/30, which is the final week of the year following the Christmas holiday peak (P45 demand: 104). Demand in P46 dropped to 58, which is consistent with the post-holiday slowdown seen in retail for basic apparel like cotton t-shirts. The 'Holiday demand regime' (P43-P46) has averaged approximately 76.5 units. Given that we are now entering the post-holiday period in late December/early January, I expect demand to regress toward the late-autumn/pre-holiday baseline. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this transition from the holiday peak back to normalcy (P43-P46 mean: 76.5). Lead time remains consistently at 0, which allows for highly responsive ordering. Settings parameters to recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances the recent elevated holiday demand with the current downturn observed in P46.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration confirmed (Period 46): Demand dropped to 58 units from a holiday peak of 104 units (P45). The holiday regime (P43-P46) averaged 76.5 units.
