Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 399061008 (Womens Slim Jacket). The historical demand shows samples: 9, 6, 16, 8, 14. There is a slight upward trend as we approach the spring season, typical for denim jackets. Demand mean is approx 10.6 units/week. Since on-hand and in-transit are zero, we must place an order immediately to cover demand for Period 1 (and Period 2 if lead time permits). Promised lead time is 0. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to prioritize the most recent data points, reflecting the early spring transition.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a Women's Slim Denim Jacket, which typically sees rising demand in early spring. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 30 units, which significantly exceeded the provided historical samples (mean ~10.6). The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time=0), confirming the speed. However, we stock-outed in Period 1 (sold 18, demand 30) because the initial order was too low. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' as it successfully demonstrated 0 periods. For demand, I will use a recent_N of 5 from the history (including the latest high demand of 30) to capture this upward shift towards spring. The historical samples are [9, 6, 16, 8, 14] plus the recent 30. Using recent_N=4 captures the latest samples [16, 8, 14, 30] which averages 17, reflecting the seasonal increase better than the full history.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's denim jacket. Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) was low (avg ~10.6), but recent demand in Period 1 (30) and Period 2 (55) shows a significant upward trend, likely due to the onset of spring seasonality for denim jackets. In both P1 and P2, we stocked out (ending inventory 0), meaning true demand is likely higher than sales. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent shift while accounting for stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=2) for both demand and volatility to weight the most recent peak more heavily. I'll set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 1: demand increased from Jan average of ~11 to 30+ (P1) and 55+ (P2), indicating strong spring seasonality for outwear. stockouts occurred in P1 and P2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399061008 is a women's denim jacket, which shows a significant seasonal demand shift as spring approaches (moving from Jan demand ~10 to Feb demand ~50+). Period 1 (30), Period 2 (55), and Period 3 (59) demonstrate a clear upward trend and then stabilization at a higher level compared to the initial historical samples. We experienced stockouts in P1 and P2 because the initial on-hand was zero and our orders were insufficient to cover the sudden spike. In P3, we finally met all demand and ended with 13 units on-hand. Given the product category 'Outdoor/Fitted jacket' and the date (March 4th), we expect demand to remain high throughout March. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this new demand regime (averaging ~48 units/period) while allowing for some margin to avoid further stockouts during this peak season.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399061008 (Womens Denim Jacket) is in a high-demand spring phase. Historical demand in January was low (~10), but since mid-February (P1-P4), demand has averaged 46.75 units (30, 55, 59, 43). Stockouts occurred in P1 and P2 due to underestimating this shift. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (all orders P1-P4 arrived same-period). As of P5 (March 11), we are in peak spring seasonality. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new demand regime (mean ~47) while smoothing the slight drop observed in P4. With L=0, mu_hat should reflect demand for a single period (review + lead time). Using recent statistics for sigma_hat ensures we carry enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which justifies a high service level.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399061008 (Womens Denim Jacket) is in its spring peak. Historical demand samples from Jan were low (~9), but stabilized post-February at a higher level (P2: 55, P3: 59, P4: 43, P5: 42). The average demand over the last four periods (P2-P5) is approximately 50 units. While demand slowed slightly in March compared to late February, it remains significantly higher than the initial January baseline. Observed lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods across all 5 concluded periods. Current on-hand inventory is 27 units. To maintain a high service level (profit $19 vs holding cost $1) and account for the current regime, I will set L to 0 using the 'calculate' method and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stable spring demand average (~50 units/period). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Feb at ~50 units/period (Avg P2-P5: 49.75), confirming strong spring seasonality for denim jackets compared to Jan baseline of ~9.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's stretch denim jacket, showing strong spring seasonality. Current date is March 25, 2019. Historically, demand shifted from a January baseline of ~9 units to a significantly higher regime in February and March. The last 5 periods (P2-P6) show demands of 55, 59, 43, 42, and 70 (avg ~54). In Period 6, we stocked out with 70 demand units against 64 starting inventory, leaving on-hand at 0. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on all concluded orders. To recover from the stockout and meet current spring demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher seasonal mean (~54 * (1+0) = 54) and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect recent volatility. L remains default (0).

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Sustained high spring demand confirmed (P2-P6 avg: 53.8 units/period); Period 6 demand spike to 70 units led to stockout, suggesting continued strong late-March/early-April interest for denim outwear.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1406.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Period 7 saw a massive spike in demand (272 units) compared to the previous average of ~54 units, resulting in a severe stockout since only 74 units were ordered and arrived. This spike is likely due to the start of April and the peak spring season for denim jackets. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and capitalize on the current seasonal surge, I am setting mu_hat using an 'explicit' value to reflect the jump in demand seen in Period 7, while acknowledging it may be a peak outlier. I will forecast a demand of 150 units for the next period (significantly higher than the old mean, but lower than the 272 extreme to mitigate overstocking if the spike was transient). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the increased volatility of this spring regime.

Carry-over insight: Massive demand spike observed on 2019-03-25 (Period 7): demand jumped to 272 units, up from a previous regime average of ~54 units. This indicates extreme late-March/early-April seasonality for denim jackets.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/04/08). Historical analysis shows a massive demand surge for this denim jacket starting in late March (Period 7: 272 units, Period 8: 253 units). This indicates a strong early-spring peak. The previous regime average was ~54 units, but the last two weeks suggest a new high-demand regime or a peak seasonal event. On-hand inventory is 45 units with 0 in-transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). To avoid stockouts while being mindful of potential post-peak drop-off, I will set mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect the average of the last two high-demand weeks (approx 262 per period). Since L=0, mu_hat represents the demand for the current period. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to capture the increased volatility from this spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted significantly upwards in late March/early April (Period 7-8 avg: 262.5 units/period vs previous avg 54). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2814.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), we observe a cooling of the extreme demand peak seen in late March and early April (Periods 7 and 8). Period 9 demand dropped to 163 units from 253 in Period 8. Historically, denim jacket demand spikes in early spring (March/April) and tapers as late spring arrives. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the remaining spring demand, I am using the method 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the high-volume regime (Periods 7, 8, and 9: mean ~229) which is more representative than the full history, but accounts for the recent downward trajectory. The on-hand inventory is currently high (283 units), which will likely satisfy a large portion of Period 10 demand without excessive new ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak tapering observed: Period 9 demand (163) dropped ~35% from Period 8 (253), suggesting the seasonal peak has passed but remains significantly higher than the February/early-March baseline of ~50.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399061008 (Womens Denim Jacket) is in the post-peak phase of its spring seasonality. Demand peaked in late March (Period 7: 272 units, Period 8: 253 units) and has since stabilized at a lower level (Period 9: 163 units, Period 10: 169 units). This level is still significantly higher than the February/early-March base of ~50 units, but indicates a plateau or gradual decline as we move towards late April. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. With 157 units on hand and a current demand of ~166 units (avg of last 2 weeks), I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this current stabilized post-peak demand. Using recent_N=2 for mu_hat would result in (1+0)*166 = 166. I will set mu_hat to 160 units to account for the slight downward trend likely in late spring while maintaining a safe service level for the remaining slim jacket season.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization confirmed: Period 9-10 demand averaged 166 units, down ~37% from peak (Period 7-8 avg: 262.5), but significantly above earlier regime (~50).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand for this denim jacket shows a distinct seasonal pattern: a pre-peak baseline of ~50 units (Feb-early March), a massive peak of ~263 units in late March (Periods 7-8), and a post-peak stabilization at ~167 units over the last three periods (P9-P11: 163, 169, 168). While the peak has passed, the demand has remained remarkably stable for three consecutive weeks at this higher level, likely due to spring weather. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. With only 5 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to restock based on this confirmed post-peak regime of ~167 units. I will use the last 3 periods (N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which accurately captures this stable post-peak demand while ignoring the outdated massive peak and the lower pre-peak baseline.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization confirmed at ~167 units/period over Periods 9-11 (163, 169, 168), following the late-March peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand in Period 12 surged to 227 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization average of ~167 units seen in Periods 9-11 (163, 169, 168). This suggests that while we thought the peak was over, there is either a secondary peak or volatility remains high for denim jackets in early May. We ended Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory (stockout). To avoid further lost sales, I need to account for this higher realized demand. I will use the last 4 periods (P9-P12) to calculate mu_hat to capture this recent increase without being overly influenced by the late-March extreme peak (P7-P8). Lead time (L) remains consistently 0. Given the recent stockout and increased demand, I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat to provide a tighter, more relevant buffer for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand surge observed in Period 12 (227 units) following a 3-period stabilization at ~167; suggests continued high interest or volatility in early May for denim jackets.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399061008 (Womens Denim Jacket) is in a high-demand spring season. Period 13 demand (141) has returned to the post-peak stabilization level (avg ~167) after a secondary surge in Period 12 (227). The overall demand regime from Period 9 to 13 averages 173.6 units per period. Period 13 conclude shows an ending inventory of 91 units and zero in-transit, as lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while acknowledging the stabilization and slight tapering from the secondary surge, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat (Periods 9-13 average) to capture this post-peak behavior accurately. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~174 units/period (P9-P13 avg) following the late March peak, despite a brief secondary surge in P12.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's denim jacket, which exhibits strong spring seasonality. Demand historical analysis shows a massive peak in late March/early April (Periods 7-8 avg: 262.5), followed by a stabilization/tapering phase. Recent demand (Periods 9-14) has averaged 179 units/period, but shows significant volatility (ranging from 141 to 227). Period 14 demand was 206, indicating that the demand remains robust in mid-May despite the earlier peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the current volatility and maintain service levels while accounting for the recent slight upward trend from the post-peak stabilization, I will use a recent_N window for both mean and standard deviation. N=6 is chosen to capture the entire post-peak period (Periods 9-14) to best reflect the current market regime for late spring.

Carry-over insight: Mid-May demand (P14: 206) remained strong, suggesting that while the March peak has passed, the 'post-peak' regime is averaging ~179 units with significant week-to-week volatility (std ~30).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's denim jacket. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak in late March (Periods 7-8) followed by a stabilization at a higher plateau than the pre-peak regime. Analyzing the most recent period (P15: 202, P14: 206, P13: 141, P12: 227), demand remains robust but volatile. The average demand since the peak passed (P9-P15) is approximately 182 units per period, with a recent 3-period average (P13-P15) of 183 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To capture this 'post-peak' yet elevated demand regime and account for recent volatility, I will use recent_N with N=7 (covering Periods 9 through 15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the stabilization data with the recent mid-May strength. L is set to default (0) as all historical orders have arrived in the same period they were placed.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P9-P15) established an average of ~182 units/period, showing significant late-spring resilience for outwear despite higher volatility (std ~30).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. We are in a post-peak demand regime for women's denim jackets. Since the late-March peak, demand has shifted from an average of ~54 units/period to a more volatile but sustained average of approximately 186 units/period over the last 8 weeks (Periods 9-16). In the most recent three periods (P14-P16), demand has consistently exceeded 200 units (206, 202, 209), suggesting a slight upward drift or high-usage phase in early summer rather than a decline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent stability at the >200 level while accounting for the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to reflect the entire post-peak period, but calibrate sigma_hat with a shorter window (N=4) to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient buffer for the recent 200+ volatility. This approach balances the risk of over-ordering if demand drops later in June against the high cost of stocking out on a high-profit item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime drift: Early June demand (P14-P16) has stabilized at ~205 units/period, which is ~10% higher than the previous P9-P13 average of ~185.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Slim Jacket (399061008) in early June (Period 17) came in at 141 units, which is a notable decrease from the previous three-period average of ~205 units (P14-P16: 206, 202, 209). This decline may signal the beginning of the end for the spring/early summer denim jacket season as temperatures rise towards mid-June. However, looking at the broader post-peak regime (P9-P17), the average demand remains at 169.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30 units. Given that on-hand inventory is 99 units and lead time remains consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 9 periods (P9-P17) to stabilize the forecast against the recent drop while maintaining enough stock for potential late-season resilience. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this 9-period regime to capture the established volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Early June demand (P17: 141) dropped ~30% compared to the late-May average (P14-P16: ~205), likely indicating the seasonal transition out of peak spring outwear demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical data for this 'Womens Jacket' shows a distinct seasonal pattern: demand peaked in late March/early April (Periods 7-8), stabilized at a high level (~180-200 units) through May, and is now showing signs of softening in June as we transition toward summer. Period 17 saw demand drop to 141, and Period 18 saw demand at 163. This confirms the 'Post-peak softening' noted in the CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS. To avoid over-stocking a seasonal item as its primary demand window closes, I am shifting the focus to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current late-spring/early-summer demand level (Avg ~172 units). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the game history, so I am maintaining L=0. This approach ensures we have enough stock to meet current demand without building excessive ending inventory as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Mid-June demand regime softening confirmed: Period 17-18 demand averaged 152 units/period, a ~25% decrease from the late-May peak average of ~205.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). The product is a denim jacket, which typically experiences peak demand in early spring and softens as summer approaches. We are observing a significant demand cooling period. In Period 17, 18, and 19, demand was 141, 163, and 152 respectively, averaging approximately 152 units/period. This is a ~25% decrease from the late-May average of ~205 units/period (Periods 14-16). This confirms the demand regime softening noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory as the season ends, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this new lower stabilization level (~152 per period). Sigma_hat will also be set based on these recent 3 periods to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-to-late June demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 17-19 average demand is 152 units/period, down from the May average of ~180-200. This indicates a seasonal transition towards lower summer demand for jackets.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern for this denim jacket: a baseline in January (~9), a spring climb in February/March (up to ~70), a massive peak in late March/early April (~260), a post-peak stabilization in May (~180-200), and a significant downward transition in June. In the most recent four periods (P17-P20), demand has dropped and stabilized at a lower level (141, 163, 152, 138), averaging approximately 148 units per period. This signifies the onset of the summer low-demand season for outerwear. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this cooling phase, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this new July-relevant demand regime (avg ~148), and N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the current reduced volatility (std ~11). This calibrates the base stock to the current lower demand level while maintaining a sufficient service level for any residual summer interest.

Carry-over insight: July demand transition confirmed: Average demand for the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is 148.5 units/period, roughly 20-25% lower than the May/early-June average, marking the start of the summer seasonal low for denim jackets.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), the product (women's denim jacket) is in a clear summer seasonal decline. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following the spring peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 144.2 units, a significant step down from the May average (approx. 180-200 units). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level, but we must use recent data to avoid overstocking as the season winds down. I am setting L to default (0 periods) and mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current summer demand stabilization at ~144 units per period. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the recent reduced volatility compared to the high-peak spring season.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jacket Slim' is continuing its seasonal decline as we move further into July. Period 22 demand was 104, reflecting a downward trend from the late-June/early-July average (~130-140). The average demand over the last three periods (P20-P22) is approximately 123 units/period, down from the June average of ~150. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs during this cooling period, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this most recent downward drift (averaging ~120 units), while maintaining a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for week-to-week volatility common in the off-season. The OR backend will use these values with a critical ratio of 0.95 (Profit 19 / Total 20) to maintain a high service level on the reduced base stock.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand softening: Period 22 demand (104) is ~30% lower than the early-June average (~150), confirming a continued seasonal shift toward lower summer consumption for Jackets.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399061008 (Womens Denim Jacket) is currently in a seasonal decline as we move into late July. Demand has been steadily softening from the early June average of ~200 down to a recent 4-period average (P20-P23) of approximately 120 units/period (138, 127, 104, 111). The most recent two periods (P22 and P23) averaged 107.5 units, signaling a stabilization at a lower summer baseline. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this downward trend while maintaining service levels, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (P19-P23) to capture the recent softening (Average = 126.4). Sigma_hat is set using the same window to reflect current volatility. This approach balances the risk of holding expensive inventory for a seasonal item against the need to satisfy the remaining summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand stabilization: Period 22-23 demand averaged 107.5 units/period, confirming a ~45% reduction from the May/early-June regime (~200) as the summer season progresses.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jacket Slim' (Womens Jackets) is continuing its seasonal decline as we move into late July (Period 24). Period 24 demand (73) dropped significantly from the previous two weeks (104, 111), marking a clear downward trend from the May/June peak. The current regime (P22-P24) shows an average demand of approximately 96 units, down from the June average of ~150. Based on the product category and the date (July 29), we expect demand to continue softening or stabilize at a summer low before any potential fall recovery. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the most recent downward shift in demand while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 3 periods to reflect current localized volatility. This approach balances the risk of overstocking during a clear seasonal transition with the need to maintain service levels for remaining customers.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand regime softening: Period 24 demand (73) fell ~30% below the early-July average (P22-P23 avg: 107.5), confirming the continuing end-of-season decline for denim jackets.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jacket Slim' (SKU 399061008) is in a clear seasonal decline as we move into August (Period 26). Historical demand over the last four periods (P22-P25) has been 104, 111, 73, and 78, averaging 91.5 units per period. This confirms the transition from the mid-July regime (~107 units) to a lower late-summer regime. Specifically, the last two periods (P24-P25) averaged 75.5 units. Given this sustained downward trend, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent decline while maintaining enough samples to account for the week-to-week volatility (std ~18 in the last 4 periods). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The base stock calculation (Profit $19 / Holding $1) targets a high service level (~95%), but the OR backend's cap will prevent excessive over-ordering during this tapering phase.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime softening confirmed: Period 24-25 demand averaged 75.5 units/period, a ~30% decrease from the early-July average of 107.5, reflecting the end of the summer season for jackets.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019-08-12). Demand for the 'Jacket Slim' (Womens Jackets) has shown a clear seasonal decline through July and early August. The most recent demand regime (Periods 24-26) has stabilized at an average of 72.7 units (73, 78, 67). This is a significant drop from the early-July average (~107) and the May peak (~180-200). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs during the end-of-season transition, I will use a recent window (N=3) to capture this new, lower demand level for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the lower expected volume while maintaining a buffer for the observed late-summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand regime confirmed: Period 24-26 demand averaged 72.7 units/period, down ~32% from the early-July average (107.5) and ~50% from the June average (~150).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-19 (Period 28). We are observing the late-summer trough for women's denim jackets. Historical demand for the most recent regime (P24-P27) has been 73, 78, 67, and 85, resulting in an average of 75.75 units per period. This represents a significant and sustained step down from the June/July levels (which were 100-150 units). The stockout in Period 27 (sold 82 vs demand 85) was caused by a slight uptick in demand relative to the small order placed, but the trend remains generally low. Since we have no on-hand inventory and lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this stable late-August regime. Sigma_hat will also be based on N=4 to reflect the current volatility (std ~7.6). This approach ensures we maintain enough stock for the current lower demand level without over-ordering as we approach the end of the summer season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399061008 (Womens Denim Jacket) is in a clear end-of-summer decline. Period 28 demand was 65 units, continuing the late-August regime characterized by the Period 24-27 average of approximately 76 units. Although the previous period saw a stockout leading to an 'ordered' amount of 89 from a prior decision, the actual realized demand of 65 confirms that the forecast should remain grounded in the 70-80 unit range rather than reflecting a rebound. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current stable late-summer demand level (avg of P24-P28 is 73.6). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to accurately reflect recent lower volatility compared to the high-spring peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand regime confirmed: Period 24-28 demand averaged 72.8 units/period, down from the early-July average of ~107 units, reflecting the final summer clearance/low for lightweight denim jackets.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jacket Slim' (Womens Jackets/Outdoor) is showing a significant late-summer/early-autumn decline. Period 29 demand (40 units) is the lowest since early March and represents a 45% drop from the late-August average of ~73 units (P24-P28). This aligns with the seasonal transition where lightweight summer denim jackets lose relevance before a potential autumn resurgence. Given the clear downward trend (avg P27-P29: 63.3, P29: 40), I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to a shorter window (recent_N=3) to capture this softening quickly and avoid building excess inventory during a seasonal low. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift: Period 29 demand (40) fell ~45% below the late-August average of 73, indicating the end of the summer season and the transition into a lower early-autumn demand period for this jacket.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a clear seasonal downward trend for this product (Womens Denim Jacket) as we move from summer into early autumn. Period 29 (August 26) saw a significant drop to 40 units, and Period 30 (September 2) confirmed this lower regime with 43 units. The 'late-August' regime was around 73 units, so we have seen a ~40-45% drop in demand. Given the product type, we expect demand to continue at this lower level or slightly decline further as it becomes too cold for light denim jackets before potentially seeing a small autumn resurgence later. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods since the start of the game. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent transition (P28-P30) while maintaining responsiveness to the new lower demand level. On-hand inventory is 58, which is already slightly higher than last week's demand, so ordering will be minimal or capped to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift confirmed: Period 29-30 demand averaged 41.5 units/period, a ~43% decrease from the late-August average of 73, signaling the transition into the autumn low for denim jackets.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's denim jacket, which exhibits strong spring seasonality (peaking in March/April) and a predicted decline during the summer and autumn. Current demand has entered an autumn low, with Period 29-31 demand averaging 40.7 units/period (40, 43, 39). This represents a clear stabilization at a lower level compared to the late-August average of ~73. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage inventory efficiently and minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime, ensuring base stock levels reflect current sales velocity (approx 41 units) rather than historical peaks.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Historical demand for this denim jacket has shown a consistent seasonal decline since the late-March peak, transitioning from a mid-summer regime of ~100-110 units to a late-August regime of ~73 units, and finally to a September regime of ~41 units. The last four periods (P29-P32) show demand values of 40, 43, 39, and 42, maintaining a very stable average of 41 units with minimal volatility (std ~1.8). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this low-demand autumn phase, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this stable September floor. sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N=4 to reflect the significantly reduced volatility compared to the earlier spring/summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime floor confirmed: Period 29-32 demand is exceptionally stable, averaging 41 units/period (std ~1.8), marking the seasonal baseline for early autumn.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

The current date is September 30, 2019. The demand for the last five periods (P29-P33) has been very stable, averaging 42.8 units (40, 43, 39, 42, 50). While P33 showed a slight uptick to 50, the overall trend clearly indicates a low-demand autumn baseline for denim jackets. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. With on-hand inventory at 0 due to a sell-out in P33, I will set parameters based on the most recent stable regime (P29-P33) to allow the OR engine to order enough to cover the forecasted demand while maintaining a buffer for the slightly higher volatility seen in the most recent period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight denim jacket is currently in a stable early-autumn regime. Over the last 6 periods (P29-P34), demand has averaged 42.0 units per period (40, 43, 39, 42, 50, 38) with very low volatility. Although there was a slight uptick to 50 in Period 33, Period 34 returned to 38, supporting the established baseline of ~42. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this specific post-summer regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. This strategy ensures sufficient stock for the stable autumn demand while minimizing holding costs as we move further away from the spring/summer peak seasons.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Historical data confirms a significant seasonal decline for this denim jacket. Recent demand over the last three periods (P33-P35) has been 50, 38, and 18 respectively, indicating a further softening into October from the September 'floor' of ~41 units. The Period 35 demand of 18 units suggests the start of a new, lower regime as winter approaches and interest in lightweight denim jackets hits a seasonal minimum. Lead time is stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a low-demand product, I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for this recent dip, using a value of 25 (approximating the mean of the late-September/early-October transition) and a conservative sigma_hat to manage the low but present variance.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime softening: Period 35 demand (18) fell ~55% below the September average of 41, indicating a transition into the late-autumn seasonal low for denim jackets.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Slim Jacket (SKU 399061008) is currently in a late-autumn seasonal low. Period 35 showed a significant drop to 18 units, followed by a slight recovery to 32 units in Period 36. The average demand over the last two periods (P35-P36) is 25 units, which is a marked decrease from the September average of ~41. Given the date (2019/10/21), we are moving deeper into the colder months where lightweight denim jackets typically see reduced demand until the next spring cycle. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set the demand parameters using recent_N=3 to capture this downward trend while allowing for some volatility (std for P34-P36 is ~10). This approach balances the risk of overstocking during the off-season against the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which technically justifies a high service level, but requires caution as the seasonal floor approaches.

Carry-over insight: Late-October demand regime softening: Average demand for P34-P36 is 29.3 units, down ~28% from the September average of 41, reflecting a deeper seasonal decline in mid-to-late autumn.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in a late-autumn transition for the women's denim jacket (SKU 399061008). Demand has been steadily declining from the March peak (~260) and the summer regime (~150). Recent demand (P34-P37) has averaged 27.75 units (38, 18, 32, 23). This confirms a demand regime softening as we enter late October/early November. The lead time remains exceptionally stable at 0 periods. To manage the balance between high service level (Profit $19) and holding cost ($1), but acknowledging the clear downward seasonal trend, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current late-autumn baseline (~28 units/period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in this quieter sales period.

Carry-over insight: Late-October demand regime confirms a drop to ~28 units/period (P34-P37 avg), reflecting the transition into the winter low for denim jackets.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for the Slim Denim Jacket is in a seasonal decline as we move further into late autumn/winter. Period 38 saw a further drop in demand to 13 units, compared to the P34-P37 average of ~28. The last five periods (P34-P38) show a clear softening: 38, 18, 32, 23, 13 (avg 24.8). Given the 'Outdoor' and 'Denim' nature of the product, demand is expected to remain low or continue drifting downward through November. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a declining product, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to capture this late-autumn baseline (~25 units), providing sufficient stock for one period of demand (since L=0) while minimizing ending inventory.

Carry-over insight: Late-Autumn demand regime shift: Period 38 demand (13) fell ~50% below the P34-P37 average (27.7), confirming a continued seasonal transition toward the winter low for this denim jacket.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jacket Slim' is currently in a late-autumn/early-winter decline. Period 39 demand was 16 units, following 13 units in Period 38. The demand regime over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) has averaged 20.4 units, representing a significant drop from the September average of ~41. Given the date (Nov 11) and the product type (denim jacket), we expect low but steady demand as we move closer to winter. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on declining inventory while maintaining a sufficient buffer against weekly fluctuations, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5), which captures this lower demand regime. On-hand inventory is currently 26, which is already close to the expected weekly demand, so the OR backend will calculate a small or zero order to align with the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Late-Autumn demand regime shift confirmed: Period 35-39 demand averaged 20.4 units/period, a ~50% decrease from the September baseline of 41, signaling the move into the winter seasonal low for denim jackets.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jacket Slim' is currently in a late-autumn/early-winter low. In Period 40, demand was 15 units, following a sequence of 18, 32, 23, 13, and 16 units over the last 6 periods. The Carry-Over Insights confirm a regime shift starting around Period 35, moving from a September average of ~41 units to a current average of approximately 20 units. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime (Avg for P35-P40 is 19.5). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), so I will maintain the default lead time setting. On-hand inventory is 18 units, which nearly covers the expected demand for the next period, meaning the OR backend will place a small sustaining order.

Carry-over insight: Winter seasonal low established: Period 35-40 demand averaged 19.5 units/period, confirming a stabilized baseline for late Q4.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The demand for product 399061008 (Womens Denim Jacket) has settled into a winter seasonal low. Over the last seven periods (P35-P41), demand has been consistently low, averaging 18.86 units per period (18, 32, 23, 13, 16, 15, 15) with relatively low volatility. There is no evidence of a shift in the lead time, which remains at 0 periods based on the historical 'conclude' messages. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this established winter baseline. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that addresses this low-demand regime while minimizing holding costs as we approach the end of the year.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019. We are in the winter seasonal low for outwear (Womens Denim Jacket). Demand in Period 42 spiked to 35 units, which is higher than the recent winter baseline of ~20 established in Periods 35-41. This could be a holiday-related bump (Late Nov/Early Dec). Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the stockout in P42, and the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set mu_hat to capture this slight increase in demand while maintaining a standard N for sigma_hat to account for this volatility. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to include the recent stable winter period plus this new spike, providing a conservative but responsive forecast for the upcoming week.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for SKU 399061008 (Womens Denim Jacket) shows a return to the winter baseline after a minor spike in period 42. Period 43 demand was only 6 units, bringing the average for the last three periods (P41-P43) back to approximately 18.6 units, consistent with the winter seasonal low identified in the carry-over insights (P35-P40 avg was 19.5). There is no sustained evidence of a new regime, just typical weekly volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering P38-P43) to capture the current winter demand regime (mean ~16.6, including the P42 spike and P43 dip) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the most current stable seasonal state.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019-12-16). Historical demand for this denim jacket has shown a significant seasonal decline throughout Q4, dropping from a September average of ~41 to a November baseline of ~19 (P35-P40). However, the most recent three periods (P42-P44) have shown extreme volatility or 'noise' as we approach the end of the year: P42 saw a one-week spike to 35 (likely a small pre-holiday bump), followed by very low demand in P43 (6) and P44 (1). Given the product is a denim jacket, demand in late December/January is expected to remain at a seasonal floor before the spring surge begins again. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. With 32 units on hand and very low recent demand (averaging ~14 over the last 3 periods), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the late-autumn/winter average (~14.4 units/period) while accounting for the recent volatility in sigma_hat. This will prevent over-ordering as the game approaches its final periods (47).

Carry-over insight: Late-winter demand floor confirmed: December demand (P42-P44) is averaging ~14 units/period, despite high week-to-week volatility (std ~18) and a brief spike in late November.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, positioning the product (a denim jacket) at its winter seasonal low. The demand regime from Periods 42-45 has been exceptionally low, averaging only 12.75 units per period. Although Period 42 showed a brief spike to 35 units (likely related to late November sales events), demand has since fallen to single digits (6, 1, and 9 units in the last three weeks). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs during this low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current December average and its volatility. This ensures the base stock reflects the immediate seasonal reality without being overly influenced by higher autumn demand.

Carry-over insight: Winter seasonal low confirmed: December demand (P42-P45) is averaging ~13 units/period (down from late-autumn average of ~20), marking the annual demand floor for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final period of the year (late December). Current demand is at its seasonal floor, with the last five periods (P42-P46) averaging ~11.8 units/period. The most recent demand (P46) was 8 units. On-hand inventory is 30 units, which covers more than two weeks of current demand at this low baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since this is the end of December for a denim jacket (spring/summer season), demand is expected to remain very low until the spring ramp-up begins (as seen in the Jan/Feb historical data). Given the on-hand stock of 30 and the current consumption rate, a conservative basestock approach is appropriate to avoid unnecessary holding costs over the transition into the new year. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current winter floor mean and volatility.
