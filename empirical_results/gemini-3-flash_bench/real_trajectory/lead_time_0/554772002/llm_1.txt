In Period 1 (2019-02-11), history shows a demand range between 58 and 84 units per week, with a recent 5-week average of approximately 68.6 units. Since the date is mid-February, we are approaching spring, where basic jersey tops typically see stable or slightly increasing demand. Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive within this same period to satisfy Period 1 demand. My goal is to cover the current period's demand plus a small buffer for safety stock. Based on the historical maximum of 84 and the recent trend, I will order 85 units to satisfy Period 1 demand and establish a baseline inventory, accounting for the 0-period lead time.",

While I previously identified a 'demand regime shift' in Period 4 based on the spikes in P2 and P3, demand has since steadily declined over the last three weeks (103 -> 70 -> 50) as we move into mid-March. This suggests the high demand in late February was a transient spike rather than a permanent regime shift. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 80 units. Given the downward trend (Period 5 demand was only 50), 80 units already provides roughly 1-1.5 periods of coverage.
