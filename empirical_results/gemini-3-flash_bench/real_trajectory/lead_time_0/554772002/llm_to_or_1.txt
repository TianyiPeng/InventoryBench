Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a women's basic V-neck T-shirt, which typically sees steady demand with some volatility. Looking at the five historical data points (58, 59, 81, 84, 61), the mean is approximately 68.6. There appears to be a slight shift or spike in late January followed by a decrease. Given the promised lead time (L) is 0, the base stock calculation needs to cover the current period's demand (1+L = 1). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture that recent historical mean and volatility accurately for the start of the simulation. This ensures the OR backend uses the full history provided as our initial regime.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's V-neck T-shirt (Everyday Basic). Historical demand data shows a stable range between 58 and 84. Last period (P1), demand was 83, resulting in a stockout since the order arrived (80) but was capped by the starting on-hand (0) then sold out. The promised lead time is 0, and the P1 arrival confirmed an actual lead time of 0. Given the consistent demand pattern across Jan-Feb, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the trend while accommodating the slight uptick seen in late January.mu_hat is calculated for (1+L) periods. Since L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*average demand. Average of last 5 samples (59, 81, 84, 61, 83) is 73.6. I will set mu_hat to 74 and sigma_hat to the standard deviation of these samples to ensure sufficient safety stock to prevent another stockout.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. We are looking at a women's V-neck cotton jersey T-shirt, a basic staple. Historical demand was stable around 60-80 units in January, but demand surged in February: Period 1 (Feb 11) saw 83 and Period 2 (Feb 18) spiked to 136. This spike likely correlates with seasonal transition into spring/warmer weather basics. In both periods, we stocked out (ending inventory 0) because our orders (80 and 84) were insufficient to meet the actual demand (83 and 136 respectively). The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). To accommodate this upward trend and prevent further stockouts, I am using recent_N (N=3) for demand to capture the recent surge and switching to an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to proactively buffer for the 136 units observed and the inventory deficit. I'll set a base for demand at approximately 140 to ensure we capture the full demand potential.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting mid-February: Demand increased from a Jan avg of ~69 to >130 in late Feb. Lead time confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $353.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Women's V-neck T-shirt) is exhibiting a demand shift typical of early spring seasonality. Historically (Jan), demand averaged ~69 units. Since Period 2 (mid-Feb), demand has significantly increased, averaging ~119.5 units over the last two periods (136 and 103). The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on consistent same-period arrivals in Periods 1, 2, and 3. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the lower Jan baseline toward the higher Feb/March levels. This approach balances the stock-out risk seen in Periods 1-2 with the observed demand levels while accounting for the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Women's V-neck T-shirt) is entering March. Demand analysis: History shows 58, 59, 81, 84, 61 (Pre-game) followed by 83, 136, 103, 70 during gameplay. There was a significant spike in mid-late February (Periods 2-3) which has since moderated back to roughly 70 units in Period 4. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods from all four game periods. Current on-hand is 60 units. As we move further into spring, demand for V-neck tees usually increases or stabilizes. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher February average while acknowledging the recent drop. With L=0, mu_hat represents one period of demand. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility observed during the Feb spike (std dev of 83, 136, 103, 70 is approx 28), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for the high target service level (80% based on $4 profit/$1 holding).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th (Period 6). Historical demand samples from January (pre-game) averaged ~69 units. Since the game started in February, demand has been volatile: peaks of 136 and 103 units, followed by a recent dip to 70 and 50 units. The 'Bob V-neck' is a basic jersey t-shirt; while it's a staple, it's entering a period where spring demand fluctuates. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). Pipeline inventory is currently 0. I will use a recent demand window (N=4) to capture the higher post-January mean (avg ~89.75) while adjusting for the recent downtrend. This N=4 window covers the period since the demand spike began, excluding only the first aberrant low period. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 ensures we don't over-react to the single low sample of 50 while acknowledging that the early-January levels are outdated.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are managing a women's basic V-neck T-shirt. Historical lead time is confirmed at 0 periods across all periods (P1 to P6). The demand initially spiked in late February (P2: 136, P3: 103) but has since stabilized to a lower level in March (P4: 70, P5: 50, P6: 77). The 5-period average (P2-P6) is 87 units/period, while the most recent 3-period average (P4-P6) is 65.6 units/period. Given the SKU is a basic 'Everyday' item, the spike in P2-P3 was likely a temporary seasonal or promotional anomaly. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the post-spike stabilization while accounting for moderate volatility. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent demand variability. L is set to default as the lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in March (P4-P6 average: 66) following a late February spike (P2-P3 average: 119). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), the SKU '554772002' (Women's Jersey V-neck) is entering April. Historical demand shows a spike in mid-February followed by stabilization in March. Period 7 saw a significant demand increase to 110 units, likely driven by spring seasonal factors as the weather warms. I am setting mu_hat using a recent window (N=4) to capture this rising trend (spanning the March stabilization and the latest spike). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded messages. The on-hand inventory is very low (6 units) with no units in transit, so a responsive base-stock setting is required to meet the current demand trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late March (Period 7 demand: 110 vs March P4-P6 avg: 66). This suggests a potential transition to a higher spring demand regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a women's V-neck T-shirt, which typically experiences increased demand as spring progresses. Looking at the history, demand in March (P4-P6) averaged 66 units/week, while the last two weeks (P7-P8) have jumped to an average of 97.5 units, confirming the insight from Period 8 that we are entering a higher spring demand regime. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all previous cycles. To capture this recent momentum and prepare for the seasonal rise, I am shifting the mu_hat focus to the most recent 2 samples (Periods 7 and 8) to reflect the 95+ unit demand level, rather than pulling in the lower March averages. Sigma_hat will also use the last 2 weeks to account for the increased volatility observed in this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime confirmed: Late March/Early April demand (P7-P8) averaged 97.5 units, a 48% increase over the March average of 66.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's basic V-neck t-shirt. Previous insights suggested a spring demand shift (Periods 7-8 averaged 97.5). However, Period 9 demand dropped to 62. Looking at the history, this product shows significant weekly fluctuations (P7: 110, P8: 85, P9: 62). Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high volatility in the current regime, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the average of the last three weeks (approx 85.6 units) which represents the spring activity better than long-term averages. I will use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in these weeks (110, 85, 62). L is set to default (0).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), we experienced a major demand spike of 156 units, which is the highest recorded and caused a complete stockout (sold 106/106 on-hand). This coincides with mid-April, often a period of increased demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' like V-neck T-shirts as weather warms. The 'Spring demand regime' mentioned in Period 9 (avg 97.5) has accelerated significantly. To prevent further stockouts and capture this higher demand, I am increasing the forecast (mu_hat) by looking at the most recent 3 periods (P8-P10), which average ~101 units, but weighting more towards the recent spike. I'll use recent_N=3 for mu_hat. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently 0, so the OR engine will place a sizeble order to reach the new base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge in mid-April (Period 10 demand: 156) signifies a high-season peak for jersey basics, drastically exceeding the early April average of 97.5.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck jersey top. Current date is April 29th. We are in a high-demand spring season. Recent demand has been volatile but high: Period 10 reached 156 and Period 11 was 105 (averaging ~130 over the last two weeks). This is a significant increase from the early April average of ~74 (Periods 8-9). The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current seasonal peak without over-inventorying as we move towards May, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat (covering the last 4 weeks: 85, 62, 156, 105; average 102) to balance the extreme peak of P10 with the more moderate P11. I will use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect this current high volatility. Setting L to 0 reflect the proven same-period arrival.

Carry-over insight: High-season peak for jersey basics continues into late April; demand average for P8-P11 is 102 units, showing ~38% increase over full-history mean.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 6th, 2019. This product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' cotton jersey V-neck t-shirt. The historical data shows a significant seasonality: early February demand averaged ~69, followed by a late-February spike to ~120, a March cooling to ~66, and a spring climb starting in mid-April. In April (P10-P12), demand averaged 118.7 units. Entering May, we are in the peak season for short-sleeved basic t-shirts. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been perfectly consistent throughout history (all orders arrive in the period they are placed). Current on-hand is 41 with no in-transit from before. To capture the current seasonal regime and ensure stock-out protection during this high-demand period, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) which represents the mid-to-late April spring regime (118.7 avg). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to account for the heightened volatility seen in this period.

Carry-over insight: May high-season transition: Late April demand (P10-P12) averaged 118.7 units, reflecting sustained peak season for jersey basics.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics | Jersey Basic' fitted top, which is currently in its peak spring/summer season (May). Recent demand history shows a sustained higher level compared to late winter. Specifically, the demand for the last four periods (P10-P13) has been 156, 105, 95, and 90, averaging 111.5 units. While there is a slight tapering from the Period 10 peak of 156, demand remains significantly higher than the March average of 66. Given the product category and the current date (mid-May), I expect demand to remain robust. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 13 concluded periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current high-season demand regime (averaging ~111.5), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the recent volatility seen during this peak. This setting ensures a high enough base stock to meet peak season demand while the OR engine's cost-balancing (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) maintains efficiency.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-May (2019/05/20). The product is a staple v-neck t-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics). Demand has been consistently strong throughout April and early May, with recent consumption at Period 10 (156), P11 (105), P12 (95), P13 (90), and P14 (106). The average demand over the last four periods (P11-P14) is 99 units. This represents a sustained peak season regime for jersey basics compared to the March average of 66. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 0 periods. To capture this current high-demand regime while smoothing out the outlier from Period 10, I will use a N=5 for mu_hat (averaging ~110.4) and sigma_hat to ensure sufficient coverage for the late-spring peak. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high service level requirement (80% critical ratio) against the $1.00 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime for jersey basics confirmed through May: Demand average for P11-P14 is 99 units (+50% vs March baseline).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 27, 2019 (Period 16). The product is a women's V-neck jersey basic (everyday essential). Reviewing the history, the demand for this staple item has stabilized into a consistent high-season regime during May. In the last four periods (P12-P15), weekly demand was 95, 90, 106, and 102 units, resulting in a very stable mean of 98.25 units. This follows a more volatile April. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by 15 consecutive same-period arrivals. With current on-hand inventory at 31 units and no units in transit, I will set mu_hat based on the stable May regime (last 4 samples) to maintain high service levels during this peak season while accounting for the current stock buffer. The OR backend will compute the order to meet the base stock level (mu + z*sigma) for the immediate period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. We are in the peak summer season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (Bob V-neck jersey T-shirts). Demand in Period 16 (May 27) was 128 units, which led to a stockout (ending inventory 0) because the order and start-hand stock were insufficient (total 105 units). Looking at the last 4 periods (P13-P16), demand has been sustained and volatile: 90, 106, 102, 128 (Average: 106.5). As we move deeper into June, we expect this high-season regime to persist or slightly increase. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'ordered on Period Z, lead_time was 0' pattern. I will use a recent N focus (N=4) to capture this current high-demand mean and volatility, ensuring the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to account for the \ucd5c\uadfc increase in demand and the high cost of stockouts (service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8).

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Sustained high-season demand regime through early June; average demand for P13-P16 is 106.5 units (+60% vs March baseline (66)). Stockout in P16 indicates existing safety stock levels were insufficient for peak volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554772002' (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime for early June. The demand average for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is 104 units, compared to the early-season March baseline of 66. Period 16 saw a stockout, indicating high volatility and a need for more robust safety stock. The date is June 10th, and June is a peak month for jersey basics. Given the high-season demand and recent volatility (Standard Deviation calculation over the last 5 periods shows roughly 15 units), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the current regime more accurately than the full historical mean. I will set sigma_hat to explicit=25 (which is approx 1.6 * calculated std) to ensure enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts in this high-season period, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio allows for a high service level (0.80). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17, mid-June. Demand for this jersey basic t-shirt remains in its high-season regime, although the most recent period (P18) showed a dip to 69 units. Re-evaluating the last 4 periods (P15-P18), the average demand is 98.25 units, which aligns closely with the sustained high-season average of ~100 units noted since May. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent another stockout like the one in P16, I will use a recent_N window (N=4) to capture current seasonal volatility while maintaining a baseline forecast of ~100 units. The OR backend's service level (calculated from profit $4 and holding cost $1) will naturally target an 80% service level, which is appropriate for this basics category.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are in the mid-summer peak for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (T-shirts). Historical demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 128, 94, 69, and 101, averaging 98 units per week. While Period 18 saw a dip to 69, the general regime remains in the high-demand band (approx. 100 units/week) observed since mid-May. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high service level target (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) and the recent volatility (standard deviation remains high), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the current summer demand level while maintaining sufficient safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 10 and 16. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to weigh current seasonal patterns heavily.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (June) remains stable with an average of approximately 98 units per week, following the high-season peak established in May.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 21 (2019-07-01). The product is a staple women's jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand for this item entered a high-season regime in mid-April and has remained elevated through June. The recent 4-week demand average (Periods 17-20) is 93.75 units, reflecting a stable summer baseline. I will use a 4-period window (recent_N=4) for mu_hat to capture this current summer stability while shielding from older spring spikes. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high service level target (Profit: $4 vs Holding: $1), maintaining sufficient safety stock is crucial, so I will also use a recent_N window for sigma_hat to reflect current period-to-period volatility.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, in the middle of the summer season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey tops. Demand has remained strong and relatively stable throughout June and early July. Over the last four periods (P18-P21), demand has averaged 98.8 units (69, 101, 111, 114). The most recent period (P21) saw a demand of 114, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0) because starting inventory was only 109. This confirms that demand is trending toward the upper end of the current regime. To capture this sustained summer demand and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent average of ~99. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The OR backend will use the 0.8 critical ratio to maintain a service level appropriate for the $4 profit versus $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (late June/early July) shows a slight upward trend within the stable 98-114 range; average demand for P18-P21 is 98.8 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a women's jersey basic V-neck, which is currently in its peak summer demand regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages. Demand has been relatively stable but high throughout June and early July. Recent performance (P19-P22) shows a demand average of approximately 105 units. Period 21 saw a minor stockout, indicating that volatility is still high even within the stable regime. To maintain service levels during this established peak, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current summer mean (approx 98-100) and variance. N=5 covers the shift from mid-June to mid-July, providing a robust estimate of current behavior for the OR backend to set the base stock level.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt', which experiences high-season demand during the warmer months (May-July). Current date is July 22, 2019. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Recent demand in June and early July (P19-P22) averaged ~105 units, but Period 23 saw a sharp drop to 64 units. Given this SKU is a basic 'Fitted top in cotton jersey', demand usually remains relatively robust throughout summer, but the sudden drop in P23 might signal the beginning of a late-summer slowdown or just weekly variance. I will use a recent window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current summer average (~97 units) while acknowledging the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to default to ensure sufficient safety stock against the high demand variance seen in this product category during peak months.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' Jersey V-neck. Current data (late July) shows demand has retreated from its early-summer peaks (Periods 19-22: avg 105) to a cooler late-season average (Periods 23-24: avg 71.5). Since the product description suggests it's a basic staple, demand likely floor-stabilizes around late-summer/pre-autumn levels rather than collapsing. However, the last two observations show a clear downtrend (64, 79). I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this recent cooling while acknowledging the spring/summer baseline remains higher than the early-year baseline (60-70 range). Lead time is consistently 0. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 balances the recent lower demand with the volatility of the mid-summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand shift: Demand has cooled significantly from early-summer highs (~105 units) to an average of ~72 units over P23-P24, reflecting the end of the high-season for lightweight jersey basics.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is showing a clear post-summer cooling trend. As of August 5th (Period 26), demand has dropped significantly from early summer averages of ~100. Over the last three periods (P23-P25), demand was 64, 79, and 54, averaging 65.7 units. This is a 40%+ decrease from the June/July high-season. For Period 26, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to capture this lower late-summer demand regime and prevent overstocking of seasonal basics. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to localize volatility to this new regime. On-hand inventory is 57, which nearly covers the expected demand for the upcoming period, so the capped OR policy will likely result in a small replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: August demand cooldown confirmed: P23-P25 demand averaged 65.7 units, a significant drop (~40%) from the summer peak average of 100+ units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Bob V-neck' (a lightweight summer basic) has clearly shifted into a post-peak cooldown phase. Over the last four periods (P23-P26), demand has averaged 68.75 units (64, 79, 54, 78), which is significantly lower than the ~100 unit average seen during the June/July high season. Period 26 ended with a stockout (sold 77 on 78 demand), reinforcing the need to maintain sufficient stock even during a cooldown to prevent lost sales on a low-cost item. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new, lower demand regime (August cooldown) while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the residual volatility of this basic item.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Historical demand shows a clear pivot from the high-summer regime (~100 units/week) to a late-summer/August cooldown regime (~70 units/week). For the last five periods (P23-P27), demand was 64, 79, 54, 78, and 77, averaging 70.4. This confirms the cooldown noted in the Period 26 insight. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To align with this stabilized lower demand, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean of ~70 and the recent volatility. This prevents over-ordering based on mid-summer peaks that are no longer relevant to the current seasonal cycle of jersey basics.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand stabilization: Demand for P23-P27 has stabilized at an average of 70.4 units, confirming a ~30% reduction from the summer peak (~100 units).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is August 26, 2019 (Period 29). Recent demand analysis shows that after a cooldown in August (averaging ~66 units), Period 28 saw a spike to 107 units. However, we must reconcile this with the seasonal context: the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. While summer peak is over, 'Back to School' seasonality in late August often causes a secondary, brief surge in demand for basics. The Period 28 demand of 107 supports this. I will look at the last 6 periods (P23-P28) to capture the overall late-summer average which includes both the cooldown and this recent surge. The mean for this period is approximately 76.5 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 28, so we are starting with no on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand surge: Period 28 demand rose to 107 units, likely reflecting Back-to-School seasonality for jersey basics, despite the relative cooldown observed in early August (~66 units).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Womens V-neck Jersey Basic) has just experienced a brief demand surge in late August (Period 28: 107 units), likely corresponding to 'Back-to-School' seasonality. However, Period 29 demand (70 units) shows a return to the stabilized August level (P23-P27 average was 70.4). Given the 'Everyday Basics' category, we anticipate demand to remain relatively steady through early September. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 (P23-P29) to capture the post-summer cooldown while including the recent spike to maintain a safety buffer against volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to reflect current variance. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand spike confirmed in late August (P28: 107 units), followed by a return to baseline levels (~70 units) in early September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a post-Back-to-School transition in early September (2019/09/09). A significant demand spike (107 units) occurred in Period 28, followed by a decline over the last two periods (70 and 47 units respectively). This aligns with seasonal expectations where 'Everyday Basics' see a peak in late August and then return to a stable baseline. Given the volatility observed across different regimes, I am setting mu_hat using the average of the last 4 periods (P27-P30: 77, 107, 70, 47) which results in a mean of 75.25. This captures both the spike and the recent cooldown. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent delivery history. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same 4-period window to properly account for the high variance introduced by the recent seasonality shift.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand cooling: Demand peaked at 107 in late August (P28) and has since declined to 47 (P30), returning toward the August baseline of ~70 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in the post-Back-to-School phase for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (jersey T-shirt). Historical data shows demand peaked at 107 in late August (P28) and has since fallen sharply to 70 (P29), 47 (P30), and 30 (P31). This confirms a transition back to a lower baseline demand regime as the summer/school-start peak concludes. The average demand over the last three periods (P29-P31) is 49 units, which is significantly lower than the previous summer average. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs during this cooling phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to quickly adapt to this lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand contraction confirmed: Demand dropped from a late-August peak of 107 to an average of 49 units over P29-P31 (-54% decrease).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is exiting its peak season. Demand has significantly cooled since the late August 'Back-to-School' spike (107 units), with the last three periods showing a consistent downward trend (47, 30, 26 units). This confirms a post-summer contraction. The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P29-P32) is approximately 43.25 units, which is much lower than the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window of 4 to capture the current cooling trend while still maintaining a small buffer for residual volatility. This setting balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost, favoring lower inventory levels as seasonal demand dissipates.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand contraction confirmed: Demand dropped from a late-August peak of 107 to an average of 43.3 units over P29-P32 (-60% decrease). Transition to autumn baseline regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P29-P33) shows a confirmed post-summer contraction. Demand for the last five periods has been 70, 47, 30, 26, and 46, averaging approximately 43.8 units. This is significantly lower than the summer peak (>100) and the early August baseline (~70). The SKU 'Bob V-neck' is a jersey basic, which typically sees high demand in spring/summer and a brief spike in late August (Back-to-School), followed by a cooling period in autumn. Period 33 demand slightly ticked up to 46 from a low of 26, but is still well within the new low-demand regime. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this lower baseline while maintaining some sensitivity to the slight rebound seen in P33. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline regime confirmed: Average demand for P29-P33 is ~44 units, down ~55% from the summer high-season avg of ~100.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in the 'Autumn baseline regime' for this SKU (Fitted cotton jersey V-neck T-shirt). Demand has significantly contracted since the summer/Back-to-School peaks. The average demand for the last six periods (P29-P34) is 41.3 units, compared to the summer high of ~100. The most recent three periods (P32-P34) show an even lower average of 33.7 units. Given the transition into late autumn, demand for short-sleeved basic t-shirts is expected to remain low but stable at this new baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the autumn baseline mean (approx 41 units) and variance, ensuring the OR backend targets a safety stock appropriate for this lower-volume period while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. We are in a clearly established autumn baseline regime for 'Everyday Basics' jersey tops. Demand has dropped significantly from the summer peak (~100 units/week) and the late-August back-to-school spike (107 units). Over the last 6 periods (P30-P35), demand has stabilized at a much lower level, averaging 30.5 units per week (47, 30, 26, 46, 29, 25). The last period (P35) saw demand of 25. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while holding costs are relatively high compared to the $4 profit, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 6 periods to capture this lower baseline while maintaining a small safety buffer for typical weekly variance. N=6 is chosen as it covers the entire post-contraction period starting from early September.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' V-neck jersey T-shirt. Since Period 29 (late August), demand has entered a sustained lower-level autumn baseline. For the last 8 periods (P29-P36), demand has averaged 34.8 units, which is significantly lower than the summer peak of ~100 units. The most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) show an even lower average of 29.6 units, reflecting a very stable, low-volatility environment for this basic item as the weather cools. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the stability of the current regime, I will use a recent window (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid overstocking based on higher historical summer demand. On-hand inventory is 21 units, which is close to the recent weekly demand average.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline regime further stabilized at ~30 units/week (P32-P36 average: 29.6) for Jersey Basics.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product is a Women's Jersey Basic fitted V-neck t-shirt. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm that this item is now in an autumn baseline regime, characterized by significantly lower demand compared to the spring/summer peak. The average demand for the most recent six periods (P32-P37) is 27.5 units, which is consistent with the 'Autumn baseline regime' identified in the carry-over insights (~30 units/week). Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels (on-hand 21) are currently sufficient to cover approximately one week of this low-season demand. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this settled low-demand state and avoid over-ordering based on older, higher summer demand data. Lead time remains 'calculate' given the stable history of 0-day fulfillment.

The average demand for the last five periods (P34-P38) is 23.8 units, showing a significant reduction from the summer and back-to-school peaks. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on the most recent conclude messages. Given the steady state observed in late October, I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand volatility and avoid over-ordering as we enter November. This helps the OR backend minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the lower baseline demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics | Jersey Basic' fitted v-neck t-shirt. Current date is 2019/11/11. Demand has entered an autumn/winter low-season baseline. The average demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) is 19.4 units, representing a significant drop from the spring/summer levels which were near 100 units. Period 39 recorded a specifically low demand of 7 units. Given the seasonal nature of short-sleeved t-shirts, I expect demand to remain low through the winter. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime. Lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 21 units, which is roughly one week's worth of the current average demand. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods will maintain a lean inventory appropriate for the low season, minimizing holding costs while covering current volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is a 'Bob V-neck' jersey basic fitted top, which is a staple item but highly seasonal (peak in summer, trough in autumn/winter). Demand has been consistently low during the autumn period (P34-P40), maintaining an average of approximately 20 units per week. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P37-P40) demand values were 17, 26, 7, and 13, averaging 15.75 units. This indicates the 'Autumn baseline regime' identified in Period 37 (~30 units) has softened further as we head into late November. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory costs during this low-demand period while maintaining a high service level for this basic SKU (95% target by OR backend), I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained downward trend since late September (P32), which reflects the current late-autumn demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Early Winter demand contraction: Demand from P37-P40 has dropped to an average of ~16 units, lower than the previously established autumn baseline of ~30 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a late autumn/early winter regime for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand for this item has significantly declined desde the summer peak (~100 units) to an autumn baseline (~30 units), and recently even further. For the last five periods (P37-P41), demand has been: 17, 26, 7, 13, 20; averaging 16.6 units. This confirms the 'Late Autumn/Early Winter' contraction noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking a seasonal basic during its lowest demand phase, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this 16.6 average, while maintaining L at 0 (promised/actual). The service level remains high (profit $4 vs holding $1), but the absolute demand volume is low.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Analysis of the demand history reveals a significant downward trend as we move into the winter season for this SKU (Fitted cotton V-neck t-shirt). After the autumn baseline of ~30 units, demand from Period 37-41 dropped to an average of 16.6 units. However, Period 42 saw a spike to 33 units, likely corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional activity. Given that the high-season for this basic jersey item is historically spring/summer, this spike is viewed as a temporary event rather than a regime shift. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on a short-term promotional spike while ensuring enough stock for residual winter baseline demand, I will set mu_hat using a recent window of 6 periods (P37-P42, average 19.33) to capture the lower late-autumn mean while acknowledging the recent uptick. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this 6-period window to reflect the volatility introduced by the promotional spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Winter demand for jersey basics shows periodic spikes (e.g., P42: 33 units) likely due to holiday promotions, despite a general late-autumn baseline average of ~17 units (P37-P41).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, approaching the peak of the holiday shopping season. Historical demand for this 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt shows a mid-winter regime with periodic spikes. Specifically, demand in Period 42 hit 33 units (likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday influence), while the average for the most recent 5 periods (P39-P43) is approximately 16.2 units. Given the seasonality of basic apparel, we expect sustained demand with potential holiday gift-related surges through December. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current late-autumn/early-winter baseline (which reflects the moderate 16.2 unit average) while allowing the OR backend's service level logic to buffer for volatility. The on-hand inventory is 20 units, and actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday period (Period 45). Historical analysis shows a clear transition from a summer high-season (~100 units/week) to an autumn baseline (~30-44 units/week), and now into a winter/early-December regime (~15-20 units/week). Period 42 showed a spike to 33 units (likely Black Friday/Promotion), but demand has since returned to a lower level (Period 43: 8 units, Period 44: 10 units). For Period 45, I expect demand to remain in the 15-20 range, potentially seeing a slight holiday uptick before the post-Christmas slump. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this current winter level (~17 units/week) while maintaining enough buffer for holiday variance. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered within the same period).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the peak holiday week. Historical data for this 'Womens Everyday Basics | Jersey Basic' fitted top shows a late-autumn/winter baseline of approximately 17 units (P37-P41 average was 16.6). However, the lead-up to the holidays has shown a slight increase in volatility (P42: 33 units, P45: 14 units). Given the high margin (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the OR backend's default service level is high (80%). Lead time is confirmed and stable at 0 periods. To capture the current lower winter demand regime while allowing for minor holiday-driven fluctuations, I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This covers the most recent 5 periods (P41-P45), where demand averaged 17 units, matching the winter baseline noted in carry-over insights.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. This SKU (Bob V-neck) is a jersey basic fitted top, a staple item. Looking at the demand history since the post-summer contraction (P32 onwards), demand has stabilized into a winter baseline. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) has been: 33, 8, 10, 14, 14. This average (approx. 16 units) confirms the late autumn/early winter regime noted in Period 41. Although there was a spike to 33 in P42 (potential holiday promotion), demand has returned to the 10-14 range. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set L to 'calculate' (averaging 0) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent winter baseline fluctuations while smoothing out the holiday spike of P42. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' for the same period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline regime refined: Demand for jersey basics through December has settled into a 10-15 units range, with occasional minor spikes (avg P43-P46: 11.5 units).
