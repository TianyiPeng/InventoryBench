  "rationale": "As this is Period 1, I must establish an initial inventory position. The product is a women's push-up bra, which typically has relatively stable demand but can be influenced by seasonal factors. Looking at the historical data from January and early February, demand has fluctuated between 35 and 54 units per week, with an average of approximately 43.6 units. Since the date is February 11th, we are approaching Valentine's Day (Feb 14), which is a peak period for lingerie/bras. Given the promised lead time is 0 (meaning orders arrive and can satisfy demand in the same period), I need to order enough to cover Period 1's demand. Based on the historical average of ~44 units and the likelihood of a Valentine's Day boost, I will forecast a slightly higher demand of ~55 units for this week. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 55 units to satisfy this expected demand while minimizing holding costs, as the holding cost ($1) is equal to the profit ($1).",

To capture current demand trends while acknowledging that the absolute peak (163) may have passed, I will forecast for Period 16 based on the average of the last two high-demand weeks (~152).
