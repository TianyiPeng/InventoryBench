Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Sirpa Basic TVP', a knitted sweater. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a rising trend (69, 89, 133, 126, 92) with an average of approximately 101.8 units. The drop to 92 in the most recent week suggests the post-holiday peak is cooling. Retail seasonality for knitwear in mid-February typically transitions from winter peak toward spring clearance, though it remains relevant. Promised lead time is 0. Using explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the most recent demand level and observed volatility. L=0 means we need to cover demand for the current period. mu_hat is set to 102 (mean of recent units) and sigma_hat is set to 26 (approximate historical standard deviation).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a basic sweater from the Divided collection. Looking at the historical demand samples (69, 89, 133, 126, 92) and the Period 1 actual demand (45), we observe a significant downward trend following a peak/spike in January. The samples suggest a mean of ~100 in January, but February data (Feb 4: 92, Period 1: 45) shows a cooling off. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to the profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). This means we should aim to stock exactly the expected mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent deceleration in demand while still respecting the volume seen in early February. Lead time observed in Period 1 was 0, matching the promised lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a basic knit jumper (679853001). Historical demand samples (Early Jan to early Feb) showed a peak around Jan 21-28 (133, 126) followed by a drop to 92 on Feb 4. Period 1 and Period 2 (late Feb) show a significantly lower, stable demand regime of approximately 45-46 units per week. This suggests the post-holiday/winter peak has passed, and we are now in a stable late-winter baseline before any potential spring transition. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods to capture this recent stability (mean ~45.5), and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect the very low recent volatility. The L is set to explicit 0 to align with observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Post-winter peak (avg ~100+) has stabilized to a baseline of ~45-46 units starting Feb 11 (Period 1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand data from Jan showed a winter peak (69-133), but recent data from Feb 11 (Period 1) shows a significant dip. Demand in Periods 1-3 was 45, 46, and 25 respectively. The drop to 25 in Period 3 might indicate a further downward trend as we move away from typical 'Knitwear' season into spring. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 21 units. To avoid overstocking a seasonal item (Sweater) with high holding costs relative to profit ($1:$1), I will use a recent_N approach to capture the post-peak demand regime, choosing N=3 to include the most recent shift while acknowledging the volatility observed in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: Demand dropped from a stable ~45 to 25 units, likely reflecting seasonal decline for knitwear in March.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a knitwear jumper (Sirpa Basic TVP), which is seeing a predictable seasonal decline as we move into mid-March (Period 5). Demand has shifted from a post-winter peak (100+) to a February baseline of ~45, and then down further to a March baseline of ~25 units (P3: 25, P4: 24). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand (15) is now below the expected weekly demand (~24), necessitating an order. I will use the last 2 periods (N=2) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this lower demand regime and avoid overstocking a seasonal item. L remains 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (knitwear/jumper) is experiencing a seasonal decline as we move further into March. Although demand ticked up slightly to 33 units in Period 5 (likely due to a temporary stockout at 25 units sold), the broader trend since Period 3 has averaged around 27 units (25, 24, 33). The stockout in Period 5 (0 ending inventory) indicates that previous parameters were too aggressive in lean-inventory management. With lead time consistently at 0, I will set mu_hat to cover slightly more than the recent average to prevent another stockout while acknowledging the seasonal downtrend. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the drop from the high-40s to the ~27 range. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the volatility of the entire post-February period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (March 25). The SKU is a 'knitwear jumper', which naturally faces declining demand as spring progresses. Recent demand history shows: P3=25, P4=24, P5=33, P6=28. This averages approximately 27.5 units per week over the last 4 periods, which is a clear shift from the earlier February average of ~45. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 units (orders arrive in the same period). In Period 5 and 6, we stocked out (ending inventory 0), indicating the OR backend's internal cap or the previous parameters were too restrictive given the demand volatility. To prevent stockouts while acknowledging the slow seasonal decline, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current regime (~27.5). I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for recent variability (standard deviation is around 4 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~27-28 units starting Period 3, reflecting typical spring decline for knitwear.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a knitwear jumper, which traditionally enters a seasonal low during the spring and summer months. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has averaged approximately 24.6 units per week, but the most recent observation was only 13 units. While the carry-over insight noted stabilization at 27-28 units, the dip in Period 7 suggests a possible further softening or volatility. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time documented as 0 in all prior conclusions). I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the spring trend (average ~25 units) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Since L=0, mu_hat should target ~25 units (1+0) to cover the current period's demand without overstocking, as holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a knitwear jumper (Sirpa Basic TVP), currently in Period 9 (April 8). Historical demand shows a seasonal decline from the winter peak (~100+) down to a spring regime. Over the last 6 periods (Period 3 to Period 8), demand has averaged 24.67 units (25, 24, 33, 28, 13, 25). The most recent period (Period 8) saw a demand of 25. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the current spring demand level while allowing for the volatility seen recently (range 13-33), I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the stabilized regime identified in the carry-over insights since Period 3.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a knitwear item (Sirpa Basic TVP), which is entering the late spring/early summer season. Demand analysis shows a clear downward trend and stabilization. Following the initial high demand in Jan/early Feb (avg ~100+), demand dropped to ~45 in Feb, and since Period 3 (Feb 25), it has averaged 20.0 units (samples: 25, 24, 33, 28, 13, 25, 12). Lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive and are sold in Period N). Current on-hand inventory is 13 units. The goal is to set parameters that represent this current low-demand regime to avoid overstocking a seasonal item that is losing relevance. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the data since the stabilization in late February. Given Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand to balance stockout risk versus holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a knitwear jumper, which is entering its seasonal off-peak as spring progresses. Recent demand history shows a significant downward trend: Period 9 (12 units), Period 10 (3 units). While Period 8 saw 25 units, the overall average since Period 7 is approximately 13.25 units per week, much lower than the previous regime of ~27 units. In Period 10, demand plummeted to just 3 units, suggesting the seasonal decline is accelerating. With 20 units currently on-hand and a promised lead time of 0 (consistently held manually), I am targeting a base stock that reflects this lower demand. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend from Period 7-10 while acknowledged the extreme low of 3 units in P10. This results in a mu_hat of ~13.25 units to avoid excess holding costs (Profit: $1, Holding: $1, meaning the target service level is 50%, or matching the mean).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: Demand dropped significantly to 3 units, confirming a deep seasonal trough for knitwear as late April temperatures rise. Average demand for Periods 7-10 is ~13.25.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a knitwear jumper, which has seen a significant demand decline as temperatures rise in spring. Historical samples from January were high (80-130), but recent periods (10 and 11) have dropped to 3 and 5 units respectively. My carry-over insight from Period 11 correctly identified this shift. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time has consistently been 0, I will maintain L=0. I have 15 units on hand, which is more than enough to cover the current demand regime of ~3-5 units per week. The goal now is to avoid overstocking and further holding costs. I'll use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand state (averaging ~7 units) while letting the current inventory naturally deplete. No new orders should be triggered by the OR backend given the high on-hand relative to the current mean.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6th, and the product is a knitwear jumper. Demand has entered a deep seasonal trough as temperatures rise. Recent demand (Periods 10-12) has been 3, 5, and 10 units, averaging 6 units per week. This is a significant drop from the March/April average of ~16 units and the February average of ~45 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout history. With on-hand inventory at 5 units and demand trending very low, the replenishment strategy should aim to maintain a lean inventory to avoid holding costs that equal the profit margin. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and set lead time to 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed in seasonal trough: Average demand for Period 10-12 is 6 units, down from previous periods. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a knitwear jumper (Sirpa Basic TVP), currently in its seasonal trough as we move into mid-May. Historical demand since Period 10 has been very low: 3, 5, 10, 10 (mean = 7). Recent inventory management resulted in a stockout in Period 13 (demand 10 vs supply 6). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts while acknowledging the low-demand season, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current regime of ~7 units per week. Given the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level which is appropriate for a low-margin seasonal item near its end-of-season, but I'll increase sigma_hat slightly using recent_N to ensure we carry enough to meet the recent small demand uptick from 3-5 to 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in seasonal trough (mid-May): Average demand for Periods 10-13 is 7.0 units. Stockout in Period 13 confirmed latent demand exceeds current minimum stock levels.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a soft knit jumper (Knitwear), which is currently in its seasonal trough as we approach late May (Period 15). Demand has been volatile but low in the last several periods: 3 (P10), 5 (P11), 10 (P12), 10 (P13 - stockout), and 1 (P14). The Period 13 stockout (sold 6, demand 10) suggests that true demand is slightly higher than the minimum order quantities we've been placing. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is approximately 5.8 units. Using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this low-volume, high-variance tail of the spring season. Since lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will keep L at the default (promised) value. This strategy aims to maintain a small safety stock to prevent stockouts while minimizing holding costs on a low-margin item during its off-season.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a knitwear sweater, which is in a seasonal trough during the late spring and early summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Recent demand over the last 6 periods (Periods 10-15) has been: 3, 5, 10, 10, 1, 9 (Average: 6.33), showing significant volatility but a low mean. We started Period 16 with 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 15 (demand 9, sold 6). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the observed volatility at the seasonal trough and avoid frequent stockouts while minimizing holding costs, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low but fluctuating demand regime. Given profit=1 and holding_cost=1, the OR backend aims for a 50% service level, essentially ordering the mean. However, the capped policy will help provide some safety stock. I'll set L to 'default' (0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a knitwear sweater, which is in a seasonal trough during the summer months. Demand over the last 7 periods (Periods 10-16) has been: 3, 5, 10, 10, 1, 9, 4, averaging 6.0 units per week. The stockouts in Period 13 and 15 confirm that demand occasionally spikes above 10 units, but it generally remains low. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend OR logic targets a 50% service level (q = 0.5), effectively setting the base stock to the mean (mu_hat). To avoid frequent stockouts while acknowledging the low summer demand, I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture the current trough accurately (avg ~6). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, so I will maintain the default lead time. Sigma_hat is set to the recent_N of 7 to account for the volatility seen in the last two months (range 1-10).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in summer trough (June): Average demand for Periods 10-16 is 6.0 units, with high volatility (standard deviation ~3.5).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a knitwear sweater, which is in a deep seasonal trough during the summer months. Demand since Period 10 (mid-April) has been consistently low, averaging 5.75 units per period (Periods 10-17). Period 17 demand was 1 unit. On-hand inventory is 5 units, and in-transit is 0. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for the inherent summer volatility (standard deviation ~3.5), I will use the recent demand regime since Period 10 (N=8) to set parameters. This aligns the base stock with the current low-demand environment, minimizing inventory carry-over costs during the off-season.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, deep in the summer trough for knitwear. Demand has been consistently low and volatile over the last 9 periods (following the regime shift at Period 10). Recent demand figures (Periods 10-18): 3, 5, 10, 10, 1, 9, 4, 1, 1. The average demand since Period 10 is approximately 4.89 units with a standard deviation of roughly 3.8. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time (W) of 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target a service level (q) of 0.5, effectively ordering up to the median/mean (basic base stock). However, because demand is in a sustained low regime, I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately, ensuring we don't overstock during this seasonal trough when holding costs equal profit.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (late June). The product is knitwear (sweater), currently in a deep summer seasonal trough. Demand has been extremely low for the last several periods (Period 17: 1, Period 18: 1, Period 19: 0). The average demand over the last 10 periods (since Period 10, mid-April) is approximately 4.4 units, but the most recent 3-5 periods show an even lower level closer to 1-2 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game history. On-hand inventory is currently 5 units, which is sufficient to cover the projected ultra-low summer demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this low-demand regime while maintaining a small buffer for volatility (sigma), and keep L at 'default' since lead time is reliably 0.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. The product is a knitwear item (soft knit jumper) which is in its deep seasonal trough during the Northern Hemisphere summer. Recent demand has been extremely low: the last four periods (Periods 17-20) recorded demands of 1, 1, 0, and 1 respectively, averaging 0.75 units per period. The carry-over insights previously identified a regime shift around Period 10, but the further decline in June suggests we should anchor our forecast to the most recent four weeks to avoid overstocking and incurring holding costs ($1.0/unit), which are equal to the profit ($1.0/unit). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this ultra-low summer demand floor while maintaining a tiny buffer for potential variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline further in June/July: Average demand for Periods 17-20 is 0.75 units, reflecting the absolute summer trough for knitwear.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is a knitwear item (sweater), which is currently in its absolute seasonal trough during the peak of summer. Historical demand for the last five periods (Periods 17-21) has been extremely low: 1, 1, 0, 1, 1 (Average = 0.8). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Currently, we have 3 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the low demand and equal profit/holding cost ($1.00), the backend's base-stock target (critical ratio 0.5) will target the median demand. With demand frequently being 1 or 0, our current on-hand inventory of 3 units is more than sufficient to cover the next period's expected demand. I will use a recent_N of 5 to reflect this stabilized summer trough for both mean and volatility, and maintain the promised lead time of 0.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Sirpa Basic TVP' knitwear jumper, currently in the deep summer trough (July 15). Demand over the last 6 periods has been extremely low: 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 4 (Mean ~1.3, Median 1.0). Period 22 saw a slight uptick to 4 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). While we are in the summer trough, we must maintain a minimal base stock to capture these occasional small pulses of demand. Given profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend naturally targets a 50% service level. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current summer demand regime while ensuring the OR engine has enough signal to order a few units for on-hand availability.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019, which is the peak of the summer season. The SKU is a 'Jumper in a soft knit' (knitwear), which is currently at its seasonal demand trough. Over the last four periods (P20-P23), demand has slightly increased from the absolute low of ~1 unit to values of 1, 4, and 7, averaging 3.25 units. While still low, this suggests a minor departure from the absolute zero/1-unit floor seen in late June/early July. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 50%, meaning it targets the median demand. I will use N=4 to capture this slight recent uptick in demand (mean ~3.25) to avoid stockouts as witnessed in Period 22 and 23 where inventory was zeroed out, while keeping standard deviation reflective of this recent volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are exiting the absolute summer trough for knitwear (June/July). Historically, late July and early August (Periods 23-24) show a slight uptick in demand (7 units vs. <1 unit in previous weeks), signaling the start of 'back-to-school' or early autumn transition for sweaters. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are seeing a consistent increase in demand (7 units in each of the last two periods), I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use recent_N with N=2 to capture this latest upward trend (average of 7) rather than the long-term summer average. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Demand increased from absolute summer trough (<1 unit) back towards 7 units, signaling the start of the autumn transition for knitwear.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (Knitwear/Jumper) is transitioning from its summer trough to the autumn peak. In Period 25 (July 29), demand spiked to 16 units, doubling from the previous two weeks of 7 units. This confirms the start of the pre-autumn demand increase as customers begin shopping for knitwear in August. The current inventory is 0, and lead time is consistently 0. To capture this upward trend while balancing risk, I am increasing \u03bc_hat to 16.0 (explicitly based on the most recent demand observation) and sigma_hat to 8.0 to provide a safety buffer against further stockouts during this transition. This ensures the base stock calculation, which uses profit=1.0 and holding=1.0 (z=0, targeting median demand), covers at least the expected immediate demand of 16 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: Demand increased to 16 units, confirming a sharp upward transition towards the autumn season (previously stabilized at 7 units).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Knitwear/Sweater) is exiting its summer trough and entering the autumn transition. Demand has consistently increased over the last four periods: 7 (P23), 7 (P24), 16 (P25), and 17 (P26). We have stocked out in each of these periods, indicating that latent demand likely exceeds observed sales. Given the date (August 12), we are approaching the peak autumn retail season for knitwear. To capture this rising trend and prevent further lost sales, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to focus on the upward trend (average ~13.3) but adjusting the lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time. Since the base-stock calculation uses Profit/(Profit+Holding) which equals 0.5 (z=0), the target inventory will naturally track the mean. Given the stockouts, I will set mu_hat more aggressively to 20 units using 'explicit' to ensure we satisfy the accelerating seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Knitwear entering autumn ramp-up. Demand increased from <1 to ~17 units over 5 weeks (P22-P26). Repeated stockouts confirm latent demand exceeds current sales.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (Knitwear) is currently in a sharp seasonal ramp-up phase as it enters the late-August autumn transition (Period 28: 2019/8/19). Historical demand samples from early 2019 (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show a peak between 69 and 133 units, suggesting that the current observed demand of 59 (Period 27) which resulted in a severe stockout (on-hand 0, sold 20/59) is rapidly approaching those winter levels. To avoid further lost sales during this high-growth phase, I am moving the forecast away from lagging indicators like 'recent_N' and using an 'explicit' Mu_hat. Given the demand jump from 17 to 59 (+247%) and the previous year's early Jan mean of ~100+, I will set Mu_hat to 120 to provide a sufficient base stock to cover expected arrivals and latent demand. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with the seasonal shift. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak transition confirmed: Knitwear demand jumped from 17 to 59 units in Period 27 (+247%). Observed demand is aligning with early-year benchmarks (~100 units), indicating the start of the primary sales season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (Knitwear) is in a rapid autumn ramp-up phase. Last period's demand was 58 units, following a jump from 17 units. This trend aligns with the early-year data where demand peaked around 90-130 units in January. Since we are in late August, we expect demand to continue climbing toward those winter levels. Using the last 2-3 periods for \u03bc\u0302 would underestimate this upward trajectory and potentially cause stockouts. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, forecasting a demand of 90 units for the next period, which bridges the current sales with the historical peak season benchmarks seen in the initial samples (Jan/Feb). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on the high volatility observed during this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime ramp-up confirmed: Demand stabilized at ~58-60 units (P27-P28), returning to levels approaching Feb baseline (80-90 units). Seasonal trend suggests continued increase towards winter peak (>100 units).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Knitwear Jumper) is in a sharp autumn ramp-up phase (Sept 2). Recent demand history shows a dramatic increase from summer lows (<5 units) to a stabilized level of ~50-60 units (P27: 59, P28: 58, P29: 47). The lower demand in P29 (47) vs. P27/28 is likely noise rather than a trend reversal, as seasonal demand for knitwear typically peaks in deep winter. Lead time is consistently 0. To capture this 'New Normal' and provide enough stock for potential weekly growth as we enter September, I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (average ~55) and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current stabilized higher demand regime without being overly influenced by the summer trough or the extreme outlier peak of 133 seen in January. Lead time remains 'calculate' given the consistent 0-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in autumn ramp-up (P27-P29): Average demand is 54.7 units, a significant increase from the summer trough. September entry typically signals continued growth for knitwear.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for knitwear (SKU 679853001) has surged significantly as we enter September, hitting 117 units in Period 30. This confirms the anticipated seasonal ramp-up toward the winter peak. Previous weeks (P27-P29) showed demand around 58-60 units, but the jump to 117 indicates the transition to the primary high-volume season has accelerated. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this rapid growth phase, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 125 units (projecting a slight increase from the most recent 117) and increasing sigma_hat to 35 to handle the high volatility typically seen during seasonality shifts. On-hand is currently 0, so the backend will place an order to reach this new base stock levels immediately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Knitwear transitioned to high-season volume, with demand jumping to 117 units (+100% vs prior 3-week average of ~55). September demand is now matching/exceeding early-year peaks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (Knitwear) has entered a high-demand peak season (September). Demand jumped from ~55 units (P27-P29) to 117 units in P30 and 139 units in P31. This trend significantly exceeds the early-year benchmarks (89-133 units). Stockouts occurred in Period 30 and 31, meaning latent demand is likely even higher than the 139 units recorded. Given we are in mid-September, demand for sweaters is expected to continue growing or remain at this peak level until winter. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts during this high-growth phase, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the immediate peak volume (avg 128) and use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Knitwear demand reached a new peak of 139 units, surpassing early-year highs. Consecutive stockouts in P30 and P31 verify that demand currently exceeds local stock availability during the autumn ramp-up.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Knitwear) is in a rapid seasonal growth phase (late September). Demand has surged from ~50-60 units in August to an average of 126.3 units over the last three periods (P30: 117, P31: 139, P32: 123), following the predicted autumn/winter trajectory. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this high-volume regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. With profit and holding costs equal, the OR backend targets a 50% service level, but the 'cap' mechanism will provide a safety buffer. Setting L to calculate to maintain the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in high-season volume (Sept): Average demand for Periods 30-32 is 126.3 units, confirming the autumn/winter peak for knitwear.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a knitwear item (jumper) entering its peak sales season (late September/early October). Demand has exploded: Period 33 observed a massive demand of 264 units, far exceeding the recent high-season average of ~126-140. This suggests a major seasonal spike or promotion. The ending on-hand inventory is 0, and there is no in-transit stock. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I must ensure current stock levels cover this new high-demand regime. Using an 'explicit' Mu setting for Period 34 to account for the jump to 264 units observed in Period 33, while setting Sigma to match this high volatility. Setting Mu to 264 (the most recent demand) and Sigma to a high value (50) to ensure the OR backend's service level logic (q=0.5 since profit=holding=1.0) and cap do not prematurely restrict the order size in a stockout situation.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Major seasonal demand spike detected at Period 33; demand jumped from ~130 to 264 (+103%), indicating the peak high-season for knitwear has arrived.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (Knitwear) is in its peak high-season (October). Period 33 and Period 34 demand were 264 and 258 units respectively, confirming a massive sustained jump from the previous plateau of ~130. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts during this critical peak, \u03bc\u0302 is set using recent_N (N=2) to capture this new regime of ~260 units/period, and \u03c3\u0302 is calculated explicitly based on the variation between these two peak points (mean 261, deviation ~4). This aggressive forecasting ensures the base-stock level accounts for the current high-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand regime stabilized at peak high-season levels (Oct): Periods 33-34 average 261 units/period, representing the global demand maximum for the year.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in its peak high-season (October). Demand over the last three weeks (P33-P35) has been 264, 258, and 228 units, averaging 250 units per week. Although P35 (228 units) shows a slight drop from the P33-P34 peak of 261, knitwear demand typically remains strong through October. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the backend naturally targets a 50% service level; however, because the inventory is currently 33 units and the lead time is reliably 0, I will use an explicit forecast to maintain high availability during this peak to avoid stockouts. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average (~250) and a conservative sigma_hat to handle the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Peak season demand remains high but showing early signs of stabilization/slight decline from absolute max; average for P33-P35 is 250 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (Period 37), which remains within the high-season for knitwear. Analyzing the recent peak demand phase (Periods 33-36), demand recorded was 264, 258, 228, and 195 units. This shows a clear decelerating trend from the global peak observed in late September/early October (avg ~261 units for P33-P34) to a recent average of 211.5 units (P35-P36). I will set \u03bc\u0302 using a recent_N of 3 to capture this most recent deceleration (averaging 228, 258, and 195) while maintaining enough stock for the high-season volume. Lead time is consistently 0. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, though the backend caps and base stock logic will adjust this to satisfy the specific logic requirements. Using recent_N=3 for sigma_hat captures the high volatility during this peak-to-post-peak transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Knitwear peak demand has begun to decelerate from its absolute maximum (>250) towards a late-autumn level (~195-220).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for knitwear (Item 679853001) has passed its absolute peak (late Sept/early Oct) and is now stabilizing in the late-autumn regime. Demand for the last three periods (P35-P37) has been 228, 195, and 206 units respectively, yielding an average of approximately 210 units. This confirms the deceleration from the >250 unit peak observed in P33-P34. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking as we move further into the season, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this new stabilized late-autumn average by using recent_N=3. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 3 periods to capture the current volatility of this high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Knitwear peak demand has decelerated and stabilized at a late-autumn level (avg ~210 units for P35-P37) after the global maximum of ~260 in early October.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (knitwear) is currently in its high-season peak. Demand has slightly rebounded to 237 units in Period 38 after a few weeks of deceleration from the absolute maximum (~260 units). The average demand for the last 4 periods (P35-P38) is approximately 216.5 units. The stockout in Period 38 (sold 210, demand 237) confirms that demand remains robust. As we are in early November, seasonal demand for jumpers is expected to remain high but potentially transition into a more stable or slightly declining late-winter regime soon. To capture this high but volatile late-season demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the post-peak average (~216 units) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent volume variability. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime remains in high-season volume; average demand for P35-P38 is 216.5 units, showing stabilization after the October absolute peak (~260).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 40 (mid-November), historically a high-demand period for knitwear. Recent demand history shows a slight deceleration from the mid-October peak (~260) to a stabilized high-season level. Demand for the last four periods (P36-P39) was 195, 206, 237, and 173, averaging 202.75 units. The most recent demand (173) suggests a cooling trend or volatility common in the late autumn. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this recent stabilization around ~200 units while protecting against volatility. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 4 periods to reflect current seasonal variance. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history, so L remains 'calculate'.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late autumn (mid-Nov): Average demand for Periods 36-39 is 202.8 units, reflecting a ~22% decrease from the early October absolute peak (~260), but remaining in high-season volume.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the late autumn/early winter high-season for knitwear. Recent demand (P36-P40) has stabilized around an average of 200 units (195, 206, 237, 173, 189), which is roughly a 20% decrease from the early October peak of ~260. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (which equal profit at $1.0), I will set the base stock parameters using a recent window (N=5) to capture this post-peak stabilization profile. This window covers the range from 173 to 237 units, providing a representative mean (199.2) and capturing the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late autumn (mid-Nov): Average demand for Periods 36-40 is 199.2 units, confirming a ~23% reduction from the early October peak while remaining at high-season volume.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the late autumn/pre-winter phase for knitwear. Demand has successfully stabilized following the October peak (~260 units). Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand values were 206, 237, 173, 189, and 165, averaging 194 units. This indicates a gradual deceleration but remains high-season volume. The promised lead time (L=0) has consistently held throughout the year, with every order placed arriving in the same period. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized late-autumn demand regime (194 units) and its associated volatility, while maintaining the lead time at the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $194.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand spiked significantly to 661 units, far exceeding the stable late-autumn average of ~199 units. This coincides with Black Friday/Cyber Monday week, a known major retail event causing extreme short-term volatility for knitwear. Because this is a calendar-driven outlier rather than a permanent regime shift, the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters should be adjusted to account for the immediate aftermath (December shopping season) without fully over-weighting the single 661-unit spike. Historical lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the high-season volume (averaging approx 285 units including the spike) while maintaining a higher sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last period. This ensures the base stock stays high enough to capture remaining holiday demand but prepares for the post-holiday taper.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme demand spike detected in Period 42 (661 units), coinciding with Black Friday week. Previous 5-period average (P37-P41) was 194 units. This is treated as a seasonal event spike rather than a sustainable regime shift.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Period 42 (Black Friday week) saw an extreme demand spike to 661 units, which led to a stockout. Period 43 demand dropped to 118 units, which is significantly lower than the pre-Black Friday late-autumn average of ~199 units (P36-P40). This drop suggests a 'post-holiday hangover' or the start of the winter-to-spring transition for knitwear. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (Periods 41-43) to capture the trend: 165, 661 (outlier included but balanced), and 118. This results in an average of ~314 units. While 118 is low, we must be cautious not to under-stock if demand is merely volatile around a 180-200 unit mean. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1), so the OR backend will target a 50% service level base stock (the median). mu_hat reflects 1+L periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand post-Black Friday (P43) dropped to 118 units, below the late-autumn average (~199). This may signal the beginning of a seasonal deceleration as the core winter shopping period peaks.

We are now in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has significantly cooled following the late November peak (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Demand for Period 43 and 44 was 118 and 101 respectively, showing a clear descent from the 200+ unit average maintained in October and November. This aligns with standard retail seasonality for knitwear where the majority of winter purchases are front-loaded in late autumn. Given that lead time remains consistently 0, we can adjust base stock levels to reflect this new stabilization. The average demand of the last two periods (P43-P44) is 109.5. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough safety stock for late-season shoppers. With On-hand inventory at 214 and demand trending towards ~100-110, the OR backend will naturally scale down ordering while maintaining sufficient service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: Knitwear demand has shifted from high-season volume (~200 units) to a post-peak stabilization level (avg ~110 units for P43-P44) following the Black Friday spike.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-Christmas week. Historically, for knitwear, demand shifts from a high-season peak (Oct-Nov) towards a post-peak stabilization level in December. Recent periods (P43-P45) show demand following the Black Friday spike has stabilized around 114 units (118, 101, 124). Given we are now in the Christmas week, a slight seasonal uptick or maintenance of this 'post-peak' level is expected before the January clearance phase. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this post-Black Friday regime (avg ~114) and sigma_hat to reflect the moderate volatility as we exit the peak season. With on-hand inventory at 170 units, a base stock targeting this mean should sufficiently cover immediate demand without overstocking before the likely January drop-off.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Black Friday: Average demand for P43-P45 is 114.3 units, significantly lower than the late-autumn average (~200) but higher than summer levels, representing the core winter baseline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30). Historical demand for this knitwear SKU shows a clear seasonal pattern: a deep summer trough (<1 unit), an autumn ramp-up starting in August (P25), a peak in October (~260 units), and a post-peak stabilization in November/December (~114 units). The extreme spike in P42 was a Black Friday event (661 units). Since then, demand has stabilized between 101 and 135 (Avg P43-P46 = 119.5). Given we are entering January, demand is expected to remain around this core winter baseline or slightly decline towards the February levels (~80-90) observed at the start of the year. With on-hand inventory at 35 and the last few periods of demand being 118, 101, 124, and 135, we need to restock to meet this immediate demand level. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the post-Black Friday baseline (avg ~120), excluding the outlier spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-peak winter: Average demand for P43-P46 is 119.5 units, representing the mid-winter baseline before the expected late-winter/spring decline.
