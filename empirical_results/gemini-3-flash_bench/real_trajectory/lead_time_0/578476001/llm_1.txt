  "rationale": "The current date is December 30, 2019 (Period 47). This is the final period of the game/year. World knowledge of the retail calendar suggests that demand for women's tailoring (trousers) significantly declines after the Christmas holiday and into the New Year, as consumers pivot away from holiday shopping. Recent demand history shows Period 46 (Dec 23) was 79 units, down from 125 in Period 45. The Carry-over insights previously noted a holiday bump (Avg ~92-112) above the late-autumn cooling floor. Given this is the final period (Period 47), inventory should be managed to cover expected demand without excessive overstock, as the game ends after this period's demand resolution. Based on the post-holiday timing and the drop to 79 in the previous week, a demand forecast of approximately 60-70 units is reasonable. Current on-hand inventory is 21 units. Lead time is confirmed as 0. To meet a demand of ~70 units and ending with minimal stock, an order of 50 units is appropriate (21 + 50 = 71).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand regime shift: Post-Christmas seasonal decline confirmed in P46 (demand 79, -37% from P45) as peak holiday shopping for tailoring concludes.",
