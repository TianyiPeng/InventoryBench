Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Leggings in extra sturdy jersey', a basic clothing item. Historical demand from the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a clear upward trend: 37, 95, 121, 153, 145. This suggests the product is ramping up after a post-holiday lull or entering a spring season. The mean demand of these 5 samples is 110.2, and the standard deviation is 46.8. Since promised lead time is 0 and we have no arrival history yet, I will set L to 'default'. For demand (mu_hat), the recent trend is much higher than the initial samples, so I will use recent_N=3 (average of 121, 153, 145 = 139.7) to capture the current plateau. For sigma_hat, recent_N=3 will be used to reflect current volatility. This conservative approach ensures we cover the (L+1) period demand given the positive trend.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a basic jersey legging, which typically sees stable year-round demand but can have slight upticks in early spring. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 135 units, which is consistent with the upward trend seen in the historical samples (37, 95, 121, 153, 145). The average demand over the last 6 samples (including Period 1) is approximately 114.3. The most recent three samples (153, 145, 135) suggest a stabilization around 140-150 units. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently low (33 units) because demand in Period 1 (135) was significant. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this recent high-demand regime for both mean and volatility, ensuring the base stock covers the anticipated demand of ~140-150 units.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, following a period of high demand (191 units) that resulted in a stockout (160 sold vs 191 demand). The item is a 'Jersey Basic Legging', which typically sees strong, consistent demand in early spring. Demand has trended upwards significantly since early January (37, 95, 121, 153, 145, 135, 191). The average of the last 4 periods (P-1, P1, P2, plus the last historical sample) is approximately 149 units, but the most recent pulse (191) indicates a peak. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this upward shift while tempering the 191 spike slightly. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need a significant order to meet current demand and rebuild safety stock to prevent another stockout.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a SKU of leggings/tights (Divided Basics). Historical demand samples show a clear upward trend from early January (37, 95, 121, 153, 145) into the game periods (135, 191, 132). The average demand over the last 3 periods is 152.6, significantly higher than the early January baseline. As we enter March, standard retail seasonality for 'Divided Basics' (aimed at a younger demographic) often maintains steady demand or sees a slight uptick. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods for the first three periods. I am setting L to default (0) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand regime (approx 153/week), ensuring we maintain enough stock to cover this higher level while respecting the relatively low holding cost vs high profit ($19 profit vs $1 holding).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: From early Jan avg (~110) to late Feb avg (~153), a ~39% increase in baseline demand.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616006 (Divided Basics Leggings) is currently in Period 5 (March 11, 2019). Historical demand samples show a high of 153 in late January, while game history (Periods 1-4) shows demand ranging from 132 to 191, with an average of 149.5 over the last 4 periods. The carry-over insight noted a shift to ~153. Given that late February/early March demand has been consistently higher than the January baseline, I will use recent_N=4 to capture this 'game-time' demand regime which averages ~150 units/period. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), verified by 4 consecutive data points. I will set L to default (0), mu_hat to recent_N=4 (covering the current period's forecast of ~150), and sigma_hat to recent_N=4 to account for the recent volatility (std dev approx 27.6). This approach ensures we maintain a base stock level sufficient to avoid stockouts like the one seen in Period 2 while managing holding costs for this basic jersey item.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/18. The product is a staple item ('Divided Basics' jersey leggings). Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Demand history shows two phases: an initial build-up stage in Jan/Feb and a stabilization phase from mid-Feb through mid-March. Specifically, demand in the last five periods (P1-P5) has been: 135, 191, 132, 140, 125, which averages 144.6. This is consistent with the 'Carry-Over Insight' from Period 4 noting a shift to a ~145-153 baseline. While there was a spike of 191 in P2 (possibly a seasonal fluctuation or promotion), the most recent three periods (P3-P5) have stabilized around an average of 132.3. To avoid overreacting to the P2 spike while maintaining sufficient safety stock to cover the higher baseline, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=5 for demand mean (mu_hat) captures the post-shift regime (avg 144.6), and N=5 for sigma_hat captures the recent volatility (std ~26.4). The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, 2019. This is an extra-sturdy jersey legging (SKU 189616006), a staple basic. Observed demand in the last three periods (P4: 140, P5: 125, P6: 111) shows a slight cooling trend from the February peak (191 in P2), but remains higher than the earliest January samples. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods (arrived in same period for P1-P6). With an on-hand inventory of 78 and no units in transit, I'll set mu_hat using the last 6 periods of game history (avg ~135) to capture the current active regime. Since the demand variance has stabilized after the high-volatility Period 2, recent_N for sigma_hat with N=3 will better capture the current lower volatility, avoiding over-stocking while maintaining the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/01. The product is a 'Jersey Basic' legging. Historically, demand peaked in late Jan/early Feb (around 153-191) and has since stabilized to a lower level of approximately 110-125 over the last three weeks (Period 5-7). Specifically, demand for the last three periods was 125, 111, and 110 (avg 115.3). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. We have 53 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current stabilized demand level of ~115 per period. Since lead time is 0, the forecast covers 1 period (L+1=1). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. This approach balances the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding overcapitalization based on the earlier peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Demand scaled down from early March peaks (~140) to a stable range of 110-125 (avg ~115) from 2019-03-11 (P5) to 2019-03-25 (P7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. This product is 'Heavy jersey long leg leggings,' which typically sees high demand in early spring but may start to stabilize as weather warms. Reviewing history from P5 to P8, demand has been very stable: 125, 111, 110, 116 (average ~115.5). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 8 concluded cycles. On-hand inventory is currently low (14 units) after the P8 demand resolution. I will use a recent_N approach for both lead time (N=8) and demand (N=4) to capture this recent stabilization at ~115 units per period. This ensures the base stock formula (L+1 periods of demand) targets approximately 231 units total coverage, which balances the high profit margin versus the low holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a basic jersey legging, which typically exhibits stable demand outside of major seasonal shifts. Reviewing the historical demand since Period 5 (start of the stabilized regime identified in previous carry-over insights), demand has been: 125, 111, 110, 116, 91. While the most recent period saw a dip to 91, the average over these last 5 periods is approximately 110.6. There is no major upcoming holiday or seasonal driver in late April for this basic category that suggests a spike. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 9 completed cycles. Given the target service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, I will use recent trends to set parameters. I am choosing N=5 for the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to capture the stable regime while acknowledging the slight downward trend in the most recent week.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a staple item (Jersey Basic Leggings). Recent demand (Periods 9-10) has shown a slight downward shift compared to March, with demand values of 91 and 97 (avg ~94). The previous demand stabilization identified in Period 8 (avg ~115) appears to have softened as we enter mid-spring. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 10 completed cycles. To optimize for the recent softening in demand while maintaining a high service level (profit $19 vs. holding cost $1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (encompassing P8-P10) to capture the trend while providing enough weight for stability. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 (encompassing the stable period from P6-P10) to accurately reflect current volatility without being overly influenced by earlier March spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed in mid-April: Average demand decreased from ~115 (P5-P8) to ~94 (P9-P10), an 18% reduction.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. We are observing a significant and sustained downward trend in demand. After a period of stabilization around 110-120 units, demand has dropped in the last three periods: P9 (91), P10 (97), and P11 (74). The most recent value (74) suggests the previous 'softening' insight from Period 11 (avg ~94) may be underestimating the current decline. Given the product (heavy jersey leggings) and the transition into warmer late-spring/early-summer weather, this decline is seasonally logical. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this latest regime (average ~87) rather than the longer-term history. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels are currently healthy (on-hand 45), so the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain the new lower base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 11/12: Significant drop from ~115 (Mar/Apr) to ~87 (last 3 periods), likely due to seasonal change affecting heavy leggings.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is 'Heavy jersey long leg' leggings, which are entering a clear seasonal decline as spring progresses into summer. Demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) shows a steady downward trend: 116, 91, 97, 74, 73. The last two periods specifically stabilized at an average of 73.5. Historically, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am setting L to default (0). To capture the recent seasonal softening while maintaining a small buffer for the slightly higher volatility seen in April, I will use recent_N with N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) and sigma_hat. This balances the most recent low demand (73-74) with the slightly higher preceding weeks to avoid under-ordering if demand plateaus.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). Demand for 'Heavy jsy long leg' (heavy leggings) has shown a clear downward trend as the weather warms. In the last three periods (P11-P13), demand was 74, 73, and 54, averaging ~67 units. This confirms the seasonal softening noted in previous insights. The most recent demand (54) suggests the decline might still be accelerating as summer approaches. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs, I am targeting a demand regime based on the last 3 periods (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, which allows for highly responsive ordering. The OR backend will maintain a lower base stock reflecting this reduced demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline accelerating mid-May: Last period demand (54) is substantially lower than the April/May transition average (~73), confirming deep end-of-season softening for heavy leggings.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Heavy jersey long leg leggings', which is highly seasonal and currently in a clear downward demand trend as we move into late May (Period 15). Demand has dropped from a March average of ~115 to a recent 4-week average (P11-P14) of 68.25 units. The most recent demand (P14) was 72, but the prior period was 54, indicating significant volatility during this decline. We are currently at Period 15 (May 20), which is well into the warm season, supporting the hypothesis of a sustained seasonal low. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs for a seasonal item at the end of its peak, I am using recent_N=4 to capture the lower demand regime while allowing some buffer for the slight uptick observed in Period 14. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time as it has been reliably 0.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616006' (heavy jersey leggings) is experiencing a clear end-of-season decline as we move into late May. Demand has dropped significantly from early March peaks (~125-140) to a recent 5-period average (P11-P15) of approximately 64.6 units. The most recent demand (P15) was 50 units. Given the transition to warmer weather, this downward trend is expected to continue or stabilize at a lower floor. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs at the end of the season, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent softened demand regime (avg ~65), which results in a base stock level sufficient for current trends while minimizing excess inventory. The OR backend will balance the high profit ($19) against holding cost ($1), but since lead time is 0, we can afford lean inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season decline confirmed for late May: 5-period average (P11-P15) dropped to ~65 units, compared to ~115 in March/April. Demand is consistently trending below 75 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03 (Period 17). The product is 'Heavy jsy long leg' (heavy leggings), which is experiencing a sustained end-of-season demand decline as summer begins. Demand has consistently dropped from ~115 (Mar/Apr) to ~50-70 in May, and the most recent two periods (P15-P16) recorded demand of 50 and 48 units respectively. I am setting L=0 based on the consistently observed lead time of 0 periods in all previous cycles. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low-demand regime (avg \u2248 56) while remaining responsive to the trend, rather than the much higher historical averages. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=4) to account for the reduced volatility at these lower demand levels, preventing excessive stock-outs while minimizing holding costs as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Early June demand confirmed at <50 units level (P15-16 avg: 49), following May decline. The 4-period average (P13-P16) is 56 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. This SKU is 'Heavy jsy long leg' leggings. We are firmly in the summer season, where demand for heavy jersey leggings has hit a seasonal floor. Recent demand (P13-P17) has been 54, 72, 50, 48, 53, averaging approximately 55 units per period. The spike in P14 (72) appears to be an outlier in a generally downward/flat trend near the floor. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking a seasonal item at its trough, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this low-demand regime (~55 units/period) while ignoring the much higher spring volumes. I will use N=5 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: June floor confirmed: Demand for heavy leggings has stabilized at a late-spring/early-summer floor of ~50-55 units per period (P15-P17 average: 50.3).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). The SKU is 'Heavy jersey long leg leggings', which is seasonally declining into the summer months. Historical data and recent periods confirm a sustained trend shift: mean demand has dropped from ~115 (Mar/Apr) to ~50-55 (late May/early June). Most recently, Period 18 saw demand dip further to 36 units, which is the lowest recorded value in the actual history. While the previous 3-period average (P15-P17) was ~50, adding Period 18 brings the 4-period average down to ~46.75 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this low-demand floor while acknowledging the high service level requirements (Profit $19 vs Holding $1). Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history.

Carry-over insight: June demand floor updated: Recent demand (P15-P18) has averaged 46.75 units, reflecting the seasonal irrelevance of heavy jersey leggings in summer.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is 'Heavy jersey long leggings', which is highly seasonal for colder weather. Demand has continued to drop through June, with the most recent two periods (P18, P19) recording demand of 36 and 35 units respectively. This is lower than the previous floor of ~50. Since we are in the peak of summer, demand is expected to remain at this low level or potentially soften further until late summer/autumn. I will focus on a recent window of 5 periods (P15-P19) to set the demand parameters, as this captures the representative summer demand (average ~44.4 units, but trending down to ~35). Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat will weight these lower observations. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: June/July demand floor update: Demand has further dropped from ~50 to ~35 units per period (P18-19 average: 35.5) as the product hits minimum seasonal relevance in mid-summer.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/7/1 (Period 21). The product is 'Heavy jersey long leg' leggings, which are currently in the deepening mid-summer seasonal trough. Demand has reached a new low of 20 units in Period 20, following a decline from the ~35 unit floor observed in mid-June. The current on-hand inventory is 39 units, which already covers approximately two periods of the most recent demand level without any new orders. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will adjust the mu_hat to reflect this new local floor using the last 3 periods (P18-P20) to capture the accelerating decline, and use recent variance to set sigma_hat. This conservative approach prevents overstocking a winter-weighted item during July.

Carry-over insight: July demand floor confirmed: Demand dropped to 20 units in Period 20, suggesting a new mid-summer seasonal low (P18-P20 average: 30.3).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Heavy jersey leggings' is at its seasonal minimum in July. Demand has consistently dropped and stabilized at a very low level: the last four periods (P18-P21) show demand of 36, 35, 20, and 21 respectively. The average of the most recent two periods (P20-P21) is 20.5 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend normally maintains a high service level, but current inventory (25 units) already exceeds the recent demand average. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the current stable floor of ~25 units (average of 36, 35, 20, 21 is ~28, but N=3 specifically targets the most recent July trough). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product, 'Heavy jersey leggings', is in its seasonal trough as expected for mid-summer. Demand has been extremely low for the past month (P18-P21 demand: 36, 35, 20, 21). However, Period 22 saw a sudden spike back to 40 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). This spike may be noise or a minor mid-summer fluctuation, but since the seasonal bottom was previously established around 20-30 units, I must adjust to prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the overall low seasonality. I am using recent_N=5 for demand to capture the July floor and the most recent spike (Avg P18-P22: 30.4). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The goal is to rebuild a small buffer following the stockout while remaining lean for summer.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Mid-summer demand floor confirmed with occasional volatility; while July demand reached a low of 20-21 (P20-21), a spike to 40 in P22 suggests a slightly higher safe base-stock is needed than the absolute seasonal low.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is heavy jersey leggings, which are currently at their seasonal low during mid-summer. Demand in July has fluctuated between a low of 20 and a recent high of 47 in Period 23 (stockout occurred, selling all 46 units available). The 4-period average (P20-P23) is 32 units, but the last two periods averaged 43.5. Given the stockout in P23 and the slightly higher demand observed in mid-July compared to late June (which saw a floor of 20), I will adjust the mu_hat to account for this minor late-summer uptick while maintaining caution against holding excess stock of a heavy garment in July. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the recent volatility and slight upward trend from the 20-unit floor.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Late July demand shows a minor uptick from the mid-summer floor (P22-23 avg: 43.5 vs P20-21 avg: 20.5), though still low relative to spring peaks.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product (Heavy jersey leggings) is currently in a mid-summer demand trough. Recent demand (P20-P24) has been highly volatile: 20, 21, 40, 47, 28 (mean: 31.2, std: 11.8). The spiked demand in P22-P23 suggests some early 'back-to-school' interest or technical volatility, but the P24 drop to 28 indicates we are not yet in a sustained autumn ramp-up. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To manage the current volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs for a product still in its low season, I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the most recent mid-summer behavior. This provides a safety buffer against the intermittent 40+ demand spikes while acknowledging the lower baseline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th. Demand for 'Heavy jsy long leg' (heavy leggings) is showing early signs of a late-summer/pre-autumn recovery. Demand in P25 was 63 units, significantly higher than the mid-summer lows (20-30 units) and exceeding current stock levels, resulting in a stockout. This follows an upward trend seen in P23 (47 units). As we move into August, seasonal demand for sturdier jersey leggings typically begins to rise in preparation for cooler weather. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this recovery and prevent further stockouts while acknowledging we are still early in the seasonal transition, I will use a recent demand window that captures this uptick. Specifically, I will use N=3 for mu_hat (P23-P25 average: ~46 units) to reflect the recent acceleration, and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last month (range 28-63).

Carry-over insight: Early August demand recovery: Demand increased to 63 units in Period 25, marking the first significant breakout from the summer floor (avg ~35) as seasonal relevance for heavy leggings returns.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Heavy jsy long leg' (extra sturdy jersey leggings) is entering its fall recovery phase. Current date is August 12, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear pivot: July demand (Periods 20-23) averaged ~32 units, while the last two periods (P25-P26) have surged to 63 and 89 units respectively. This aligns with a typical back-to-school/late-summer transition for 'Divided Basics' and heavy-weight jersey items. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. Since the current demand (89) significantly exceeds the orders placed (74) resulting in 0 on-hand inventory and lost sales, I must aggressively increase the base stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the acceleration (averaging P24-26 demand: 28, 63, 89), which effectively anticipates the seasonal ramp-up while the OR engine applies the critical ratio for service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Fall recovery confirmed. Demand increased from a mid-summer average of ~30 (P20-23) to 89 in P26, reflecting back-to-school seasonality for heavy jersey leggings.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Heavy jsy long leg' (leggings) is exhibiting a clear seasonal recovery as we enter mid-August (Period 28, 2019-08-19). Demand has risen from a summer floor of ~35 (July) to 63 (P25), 89 (P26), and now 105 (P27), indicating a strong trend towards late-summer/fall 'back-to-school' levels. Historical data from early February (P1-P4) shows demand ranging from 130-150. Based on the 3-period trajectory (63, 89, 105), I expect Period 28 demand to reach approximately 115-125 units. Lead time remains stable at 0. With only 6 units on hand and 0 in-transit, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 130 to ensure sufficient stock to meet the upward trend and avoid stockouts seen in the last three periods (where sales were capped by arrivals/on-hand). The sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the increasing volatility typical during a regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Fall recovery acceleration: Demand increased from 63 to 105 over the last 3 periods (P25-P27), averaging 85.7 units. The most recent demand (105) and historical Feb levels (~130+) suggest baseline demand is returning to >100 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for heavy jersey leggings is confirming a strong fall recovery as we enter late August. Recent demand figures for the last three periods (P26-P28) are 89, 105, and 101, averaging 98.3 units per period. This is a significant breakout from the mid-summer lows (~30 units) and aligns with back-to-school and cooler weather seasonality. Current on-hand inventory is 71 units, which is below the expected weekly demand. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), a high service level is optimal. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this new stabilized fall demand level (approx 98 units/period). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand stabilization: Demand has stabilized at a new higher regime for late August, averaging ~98 units over the last 3 periods (P26-P28), up from the early August recovery phase.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, entering the peak fall season for 'heavy sturdy jersey leggings'. Looking at the demand history, we saw a recovery in August (P26-P28) where demand averaged ~98 units. Period 29 showed a slight dip to 72, but this is often a precursor to strong September back-to-school and early autumn demand. Based on the seasonal pattern from early 2019 (P1-P4), where demand was consistently between 135-191, I expect demand to continue trending upward. To capture this recovery regime, I am using a recent_N approach with N=4 (covering the August recovery and stabilization periods P26-P29). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The high profit margin relative to holding cost ($19 vs $1) mandates a high service level, supporting aggressive stocking as we enter the cooler months.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift: Fall recovery has moved past the initial August bounce. While P29 saw a dip (72), the prior 3-period average of ~98 and seasonal relevance suggest a baseline of 90-110 units as we enter autumn.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in early September (2019/9/9), moving deeper into the fall season. For 'Heavy jersey leggings', this is a period of increasing seasonal relevance. Recent demand has confirmed a recovery from summer lows, though it has stabilized somewhat in the last few weeks: P26 (89), P27 (105), P28 (101), P29 (72), and P30 (83). The 5-period average for this new fall regime is approximately 90 units. While P29 and P30 were slightly lower than the mid-August peak, the overall trend reflects a return to the 90-110 range observed in spring. Historical lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers the entire fall recovery period) to capture the current baseline of ~90 units per period. I will use the same N for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen during this recovery phase (ranging from 72 to 105). This approach ensures we maintain sufficient stock for the fall season without overreacting to the minor dip in the last two weeks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in the middle of the Fall recovery for 'Heavy jersey leggings'. Demand has stabilized in a new regime after the summer low. Over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), demand has been 89, 105, 101, 72, 83, and 99, averaging 91.5 units per period. The recent 3-period average (P29-P31) is 84.7, but identifying the longer-term trend since the August recovery (P26 onwards) suggests a mu_hat around 90-100 is appropriate to capture the 'Back-to-School' and early autumn momentum. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals (P1-P31). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is to prevent stockouts during this high-demand season. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of the current Fall regime (starting from early August) while ignoring the summer lows.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (P26-P31) confirmed: Average demand is approximately 91.5 units, significantly higher than the summer floor of ~35. This level is expected to persist or increase as cooler weather continues.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in the fall demand regime for 'Heavy jsy long leg' (leggings), which is characterized by cooler weather and increased seasonal relevance. Demand has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) with an average of approximately 90.5 units per period. The recent demand sequence (83, 99, 85) supports an expected baseline of ~90 units. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while meeting this stabilized fall demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering the entire fall regime) to capture the current mean accurately, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current fall volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30 (Period 34). This SKU represents heavy jersey leggings, which show strong seasonal demand in fall and winter. The fall recovery is well-established, with demand over the last 3 periods (P31-P33) being 99, 85, and 126, averaging 103.3 units. The stockout in Period 33 (126 demand vs 110 on-hand) confirms that the actual demand is trending toward the higher end of the fall regime (90-130 range seen in early Feb). Given we are entering October, I expect demand to remain high or increase further as temperatures drop. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the stable fall recovery period (starting from Period 26) while reflecting the recent upward pressure. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Fall demand peak approaching. Recent 3-period average reached 103 units, with a stockout at 126 units in P33, suggesting the regime has moved from the 'stabilization' phase (~90) back toward the high-season baseline (110-130 units).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is entering its peak autumn/winter season (October). Demand has consistently returned to a high-regime baseline, with recent demand showing a 3-period average of 103.7 units (P32-P34: 85, 126, 100). The stockout in P33 (demand 126) confirms that the current target needs to accommodate spikes above 120 units. Given the transition into cooler weather, I will use a recent 4-period window (P31-P34) to capture the current mean of 102.5 units and set sigma based on the same period to account for the recent volatility (standard deviation ~17). This will ensure a base stock level that targets roughly 130-140 units, covering the observed peaks while maintaining a buffer for the upward seasonal trend.

Carry-over insight: October seasonal peak confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a high regime (avg 103 units over P32-P34) as the product enters its primary weather-relevant season.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616006' (heavy jersey leggings) is currently in its peak weather-relevant season (October). Although Period 35 demand (67) was significantly lower than the preceding 3-period average (P32-P34 avg: 103.6), this appears to be a weekly variance rather than a regime shift, as October typically sustains high demand for heavy jersey products. The recent 5-period average (P31-P35) is 95.4 units, and the 20-period historical average (spanning the summer low) is not representative. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the fall regime while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time remains consistently 0. Maintaining a robust base stock is critical as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (19:1), justifying a high service level to avoid stockouts during the autumn peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in the peak fall season for 'heavy jersey leggings'. Historical demand in February/March (another cool-weather period) was high, ranging from 110-140 units. Recent performance in September/October has been strong, though the last two periods (P35-36) saw a temporary dip to 67 and 75 units respectively, compared to the 100+ units seen in P33-34. This suggests some volatility around a high baseline. Given the product's description and the lateness of October, we should expect demand to remain robust or even increase as winter approaches. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture the current fall regime (P32-P36 average: ~91 units) while maintaining a sufficient buffer for potential spikes back to 110+ levels. Setting L=0 based on perfect execution history.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the product (heavy jersey leggings) is in its peak seasonal demand phase. Recent demand patterns show a stable high regime since early September. Specifically, looking at the last 6 periods (P32-P37), demand has averaged approximately 91.2 units (85, 126, 100, 67, 75, 94). While Period 33 saw a spike (126), the more recent three periods (P35-P37) average 78.7 units, suggesting a slight stabilization compared to the September volatility. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7, covering since the start of the September stabilization) to capture this current fall regime without being overly reactive to the single stockout spike in P33. Since the lead time has remained consistently 0, I will keep L at default. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=7 period to capture the moderate volatility seen during this peak season (ranging from 67 to 126).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the peak season for heavy leggings. After the October peak (which averaged around 103 units from Periods 32-34), demand in the last four periods (P35-P38) has softened slightly and stabilized, with values of 67, 75, 94, and 82. This results in a 4-period average of 79.5 units. Historically, the early year (Jan/Feb) showed demand ranging from 95 to 153, suggesting that while current demand is around 80, there is potential for higher volatility as weather cools further. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the recent stable average of approximately 80 units (using recent_N=4) to avoid over-ordering as we move through November, while maintaining a standard sigma_hat to handle weekly fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn stabilization: Following the September/October peak, demand for heavy leggings has stabilized at a lower but steady regime, averaging 79.5 units over the last 4 periods (P35-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11 (Period 40). We are in the mid-autumn regime for this SKU (heavy jersey leggings). Recent demand has stabilized: Period 39 demand was 54, but the average over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 74.4 units, representing a step down from the September/October peaks (~103 units). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient stock for late-autumn demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals in the history.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand step-down: Demand has moved from a peak of ~103 (P32-P34) to a stabilized regime of ~74 units (P35-P39) as we move into November.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Heavy jersey leggings are in their peak weather-relevant season, but recent demand shows a stabilization or slight step-down from the early autumn peaks. Over the last 6 periods (P35-P40), demand has been: 67, 75, 94, 82, 54, 54. The average of these 6 periods is approximately 71 units, while the average of the last 3 periods (P38-P40) is 63.3 units. This suggests a shift from the ~103 average seen in September/October (P32-P34) to a regime closer to 65-75 units as we move deeper into November. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a safe service level for potential late-autumn spikes, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this recent stabilization, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect the moderate volatility (ranging from 54 to 94).

Carry-over insight: Mid-to-late November demand stabilization: Demand has settled into a regime of ~65-75 units (Avg 71 over P35-P40), down from the Sept/Oct peak of ~103.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for 'Heavy jsy long leg' (heavy leggings) has continued into a late-autumn step-down. The last three periods (P39-41) have shown very consistent demand of 54, 54, and 55 units respectively. This is a clear shift from the earlier October average of ~74. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period average (approx 54 units) to avoid overstocking as we approach the end of the year. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 periods to reflect the current low volatility (std \u2248 0.6). The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) means the OR backend will still maintain a healthy safety buffer, but focusing on the most recent regime prevents accumulating excess inventory in a cooling season.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Late November demand floor confirmed at ~54-55 units. Demand has shifted from the mid-autumn regime (~74 units) to a steady late-season lower level (P39-P41 average: 54.3).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (2019/11/25), we experienced a sudden and significant demand spike to 129 units, completely depleting our on-hand inventory. This is a sharp reversal from the late November 'floor' of ~54 units observed in the preceding three periods (P39-P41). Given the date (Dec 2nd), this spike is likely driven by 'Cyber Monday' or early December holiday shopping patterns. Throughout the history, lead time has remained 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and prepare for potential sustained December demand, I will shift the demand forecast. I am moving away from the 'recent floor' (N=3) which would only reflect ~80 units (average of 54, 55, 129), and instead using a 5-period average (N=5) to capture both the late-autumn baseline and the recent volatility, resulting in an average of approx 70. However, to account for the clear upward trend/holiday spike, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 115 (total for L+1, which is 1+0=1) to ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order sufficient to meet this new peak while on-hand is zero.

Carry-over insight: December holiday spike detected: Demand increased from ~55 to 129 in Period 42 (late Nov/early Dec), breaking the late-autumn stabilization regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 09). Period 42 showed a massive demand spike (129 units) corresponding to late November/Early December (Black Friday/Cyber Monday/Holiday start). Period 43 then saw a sharp correction back down to 46 units. Historically, we saw a similar pattern in late January/February where demand for these heavy leggings was high (135+). The product is 'Heavy jersey long leggings', which makes it highly relevant for winter. The recent average (P41-P43) is 76.7 units, but the volatility is extreme (range 46-129). Given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the 'holiday regime' which seems to fluctuate between 50 and 130; I'll target the upper end of the recent average (~90 units) to ensure stock for potential pre-Christmas surges, and an explicit high sigma_hat to account for the massive variance seen in the last 3 weeks (55, 129, 46).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: Late Nov/Early Dec shows extreme demand swings (P41-P43 range: 46 to 129), likely due to promotional events followed by stabilization.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-December (2019-12-16). Analyzing the recent history, we saw a holiday-related spike in Period 42 (129 units), which was immediately followed by a sharp drop and stabilization in Periods 43 and 44 (46 and 45 units respectively). This suggests the initial December peak (likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday related) has passed, and we have entered a pre-Christmas lull or a stabilization phase before late-December clearance or final gift shopping. The average demand over the last two periods is ~45.5 units. Given that on-hand inventory is currently high (120 units), which is nearly 2.6 times the recent average demand, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a small or zero order to manage holding costs. I will set mu_hat to be explicit at 65 to account for the possibility of another small pre-holiday bump while recognizing the current lower trend, and sigma_hat will be set based on the recent volatility (N=4) to ensure the safety stock covers potential spikes similar to Period 42.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday peak stabilization: After a spike to 129 in P42, demand has flattened to ~45 units in mid-December (P43-P44).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2508.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (mid-December), we observed an extreme demand spike of 356 units, which coincides with the week of December 16th\u2014a peak holiday shopping week. This suggests the product (heavy jersey leggings) is highly susceptible to late-December holiday surges, likely due to gifting or winter attire needs. Our starting on-hand inventory was insufficient, leading to 224 units of lost sales. For Period 46 (Dec 23), demand is expected to remain high due to last-minute shopping and post-holiday clearance behavior, though it may begin to taper down from the absolute peak of P45. Given the extreme volatility (356 vs. previous average of ~45), a standard mean would be too low. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a safe base-stock that accounts for a sustained, though potentially slightly lower, high-demand period (forecasted at 200 units) to capture remaining holiday ROI while the inventory is currently 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed: 2019-12-16 saw a massive spike to 356 units, significantly exceeding the previous holiday spike of 129 in late November.

=== Period 46 Summary ===
189616006: ordered=447, arrived=447 units (ordered on Period 46, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=447, demand=180, sold=180, ending on-hand inventory=267

Daily Reward (R_t): $3153.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on 2019-12-30. Recent history shows extreme holiday volatility: a massive spike of 356 in Period 45 (mid-December) followed by a high but lower demand of 180 in Period 46 (pre-Christmas week). This confirms the 'heavy jersey leggings' are a major holiday/winter item. On-hand inventory is currently 267 units. Transitioning into the post-Christmas and New Year week (Period 47), demand is expected to remain significantly higher than the mid-autumn baseline (~75) but lower than the Christmas peak. The average of the last two weeks (P45-46) is 268 units, while the average of the last four weeks (including the mid-Dec lull) is 156. Given the stockout in P45 and the 180 demand in P46, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (P44-P46) average of ~193, and use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in December. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regime: Demand in late December dropped from a peak of 356 (P45) to 180 (P46), indicating the start of the post-Christmas cooling off period while still remaining significantly above autumn levels.
