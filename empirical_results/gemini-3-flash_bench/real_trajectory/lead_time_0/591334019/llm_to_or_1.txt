Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a women's sweater/jumper, which is relevant for the current winter/early spring season. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. The historical demand for the past 5 weeks shows a mean of 120.4 units (samples: 154, 119, 124, 88, 117). The promised lead time is 0. Since this is the first period and there is no evidence of lead-time drift or demand regime shifts, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior while ignoring any potential longer-term noise not present in the provided context.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's sweater/jumper, which is relevant for the late winter season. Historical demand shows samples ranging from 88 to 154, with the most recent demand in Period 1 being 79 (a slight drop). The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0 (ordered 141, arrived 141 in P1). On-hand inventory is 62 units. To set parameters for the OR backend: 1) L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 0. 2) mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime (avg ~101), providing a stable but responsive forecast for the upcoming week. 3) sigma_hat is set to 'default' to incorporate the full historical volatility in the safety stock calculation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's fine-knit jumper, which is relevant for the late winter/early spring transition. Historical demand samples (pre-game: 154, 119, 124, 88, 117) and game history (P1: 79, P2: 128) show a relatively stable mean around 115. Period 2 saw a spike to 128, leaving us with only 1 unit on-hand. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on Period 1 and 2 arrivals. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time is 0, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat, the mean of the historical samples is 120.4 and game samples is 103.5; the combined mean is 115.5. Given the recent demand of 128, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent activity including the pre-game data. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. The base stock policy will aim to replenish the low inventory (1 unit on-hand, 0 in-transit).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Slightly shorter jumper in a soft, fine knit', falling under Women's Nightwear/Sweaters. We are in early March (Period 4). Current demand history (including provided samples) shows: [154, 119, 124, 88, 117, 79, 128, 72]. The average demand is ~110. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods for P1, P2, and P3, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently 54 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Demand slightly dipped in the most recent period (72), but was very high in P2 (128). Given the 'Slightly shorter jumper' description, demand might remain steady or slightly decrease as the season transitions from winter to spring. I will use the recent 5 samples (N=5) to capture the trend while maintaining enough buffer for variance. The backend calculation will target a service level based on Profit ($4) and Holding Cost ($1).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a soft, fine-knit jumper. Historical demand over the last 9 weeks (pre-game and game history) shows values: 154, 119, 124, 88, 117 (pre-gameavg: 120.4) and 79, 128, 72, 72 (game history avg: 87.75). There is a slight downward trend in demand as we move further into March, likely because this knitwear/sweater item is a transitional winter-to-spring piece and demand typically softens as weather warms in the Northern Hemisphere. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent lower demand levels (average 87.75) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. L will remain at the default (0).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 591334019 is a women's jumper/sweater. We are currently in mid-March (Period 6). Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged around 120, while the last 5 operational periods (Feb-Mar) show a lower average of 79.4 units per period (79, 128, 72, 72, 46). The most recent period (Period 5) showed the lowest demand yet (46), suggesting a possible downward trend as spring progresses and demand for 'soft, fine knit' sweaters potentially wanes. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking in a potentially declining seasonal period while maintaining a buffer, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma estimation to capture the recent moderate-to-low demand trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'fine knit jumper', which typically sees declining demand as the weather warms up in late March. Historical data shows a clear downward trend in demand from mid-February (128 units) to the most recent two weeks (46 units each). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time = 0). Since demand has dropped significantly and remained low for two consecutive periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to better reflect the current lower demand regime while keeping recent variation in mind. This reduces the risk of overstocking a seasonal item at the end of its peak period, balancing the $1.00 holding cost against the $4.00 profit margin.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a lightweight sweater. Demand has shown a downward trend from early February (peaks of 128) to more stable levels in March (averaging around 49 in the last three periods). Given the seasonal transition into spring, a decline in sweater demand is expected. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (13 units). I will use a recent demand window (N=3) to set mu_hat, capturing the lower March demand levels, while maintaining a standard sigma calculation to buffer against slight variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting mid-March (Period 5): Average weekly demand decreased from ~87 (P1-P4) to ~49 (P5-P7), a decrease of ~44%.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a lightweight sweater ('soft, fine knit'). Historically, demand was higher in February (mean ~87.7) and shifted lower in March/April (mean ~49.75 since Period 5). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 8 concluded periods. I will use the established low-demand regime (Periods 5-8) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as spring weather progresses and interest in winter sweaters typically wanes. N=4 captures this stable lower-demand period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a 'soft, fine knit' jumper, which is transitioning out of peak seasonality as spring progresses. Recent demand has confirmed a significant regime shift: demand averaged 87.75 units in Periods 1-4, but has dropped to an average of 44.4 units in Periods 5-9 (a ~49% decrease). Specifically, the last three periods (P7-P9) show a further softening trend (55, 52, 23). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this decline, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~44.4) and a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this new phase. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock appropriate for the current spring demand level rather than the winter highs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 5-9 average demand is ~44 units, down from ~88 units in Periods 1-4. Most recent demand (P9) reached a period low of 23 units, suggesting continued seasonal decline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '591334019' (Womens' Sweater) is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as we move into late April. Since Period 5, demand has shifted from an average of ~88 units to a significantly lower regime. The most recent demand samples are 23 (Period 9) and 17 (Period 10), reflecting warmer weather impact on knitwear. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in a declining market, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the low-demand regime since Period 5, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect lowered volatility. L is set to default as the confirmed lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift further confirmed: Units demanded in P9-P10 (20.0 avg) are less than half the P5-P8 average (49.8), signaling continuing seasonal obsolescence for this sweater SKU.

Historical demand has dropped from an average of ~88 in February/March to ~20 over the last three periods (P9: 23, P10: 17, P11: 16). With current on-hand inventory at 39 units, we already have approximately two weeks of cover based on recent demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent additional overstock and minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while demand continues to fade, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most current, low-demand regime (avg \u2248 18.7). This will likely result in a low order quantity, allowing on-hand stock to deplete naturally.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at low levels: P9-P11 average demand is 18.7 units, representing an ~80% decline from the initial February peak (~88 units), confirming seasonal obsolescence for this knit jumper SKU.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (a soft, fine knit jumper) is clearly in a deep seasonal decline as we move into May. Demand has stabilized at a low level, with the average of the last 4 periods (P9-P12) being approximately 22 units, compared to the initial 100+ units in February. Current on-hand inventory is 6 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs for a product nearing the end of its seasonal relevance, I will use recent_N=4 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent, lower-demand regime (P9-P12). This ensures the base stock reflects the current weekly average demand of ~22 units plus a safety margin for the slightly increased demand observed in P12 (33 units).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a soft, fine-knit jumper (sweater), which is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as we move into mid-May (Period 14). Demand has dropped from an initial average of ~88 units in February to a recent average of ~20 units (P9-P13). The most recent demand (P13) was 27 units, slightly higher than the previous few weeks but still confirming a low-demand regime for late spring. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (2 units), so we need to order to meet the current week's projected demand of ~20-25 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized low-demand regime (P9-P13) while allowing for the slight uptick seen in P13. Setting L to default (0).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a soft knit jumper, which has shown clear seasonal obsolescence as we approach summer. Carry-over insights and game history show a significant demand drop from ~88 units/period in Feb/March to ~20 units/period in April/May. Specifically, demand in the last six periods (P9-P14) has been 23, 17, 16, 33, 27, and 13, averaging 21.5 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To manage the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and prevent overstocking in a declining season, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture this low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The OR backend's service level q=0.8 (4/(4+1)) will naturally favor lean inventory given this context.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a fine-knit jumper, which has shown a clear seasonal decline since March. Carry-over insights confirm several regime shifts, with the most recent stabilization occurring between Periods 9-15. Over the last 7 periods (P9-P15), demand has averaged 20.1 units (23, 17, 16, 33, 27, 13, 12). The standard deviation during this period is approximately 7.8 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every order from P1 to P15 arriving within the same period. Given the low holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), the backend OR engine will target a service level of approximately 80% (z \u2248 0.84). To capture the current low-demand plateau and avoid excess inventory for this seasonal item, I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which encompasses the most stable recent demand phase.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, and the product is a 'soft, fine knit' woman's jumper. Historical demand shows a severe decline from over 100 units/period in February to an average of ~13 units over the last three periods (P14-P16). Given the seasonal transition into summer for the northern hemisphere, this item is in a terminal demand state. On-hand inventory is currently 16 units, which already covers more than one period of the current demand rate (11-13 units). Since the OR backend uses a base stock policy (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302), maintaining a high \u03bc\u0302 or using default all-history statistics would lead to excessive holding costs for a dying product. Lead time has consistently been 0. I will set mu_hat to a conservative figure based on the most recent 5 samples (averaging 19 units) to ensure the system doesn't over-order while we bleed off existing inventory. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to reflect the lowered volatility at these volume levels.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, entering the summer season. The SKU is a 'shorter jumper in a soft, fine knit,' which is seasonally inappropriate for summer. Historical data indicates a significant and sustained demand drop-off starting in March (Period 5), with a second stabilization step around Period 9. Over the last five periods (P13-P17), demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 15.0 units per week (27, 13, 12, 11, 12). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. On-hand inventory is currently 16 units, which already covers the expected demand for the upcoming period based on recent averages. To avoid unnecessary holding costs for an out-of-season item with a high holding cost relative to profit (H=$1, P=$4), I will use the recent 5-period average (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a low off-season floor: P13-P17 average demand is 15.0 units, down from the P9-P11 average of 18.7.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (a soft, fine knit sweater) has entered its off-season floor as of June 2019. Demand has consistently declined from February peaks (~88 units) to a stabilized low over the last 6 periods. Between Periods 13 and 18, the average demand is 13.8 units. The most recent demand (Period 18) was only 8 units, the lowest recorded to date, further confirming the off-season status. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat (covering Periods 13-18) to reflect this stabilized low-demand regime, which averages ~13.8 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. Using these parameters, the OR backend will target a lower base stock, minimizing holding costs for this seasonal item while maintaining sufficient stock for the low residual demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a record low of 8 units in Period 18; the Period 13-18 average is 13.8 units, confirming the off-season floor for this knit sweater.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-10.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a soft-knit sweater, currently in its off-season (late June). Demand has reached a significant low, with Period 19 recording only 2 units. The average demand for the most recent 7 periods (P13-P19) is approximately 12.1 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P17-P19) averaged only 7.3 units, signaling a potential further drop toward a mid-summer floor. With lead time (L) confirmed consistently at 0 periods, the objective is to minimize holding costs while maintaining a slim safety stock for this low-demand phase. I will use recent_N (N=7) for the mean to capture the off-season average, but apply an explicit lower volatility estimate (sigma) reflecting the compressed variance at these low levels (ranging from 2 to 12). On-hand inventory is 18 units, which already covers more than one week of even the P13-P19 average demand, so provided parameters will likely result in a minimal or zero order from the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand hit a seasonal record low of 2 units in Period 19; the 3-period average (P17-P19) has dropped to 7.3 units, confirming the deep summer off-season for this knit jumper.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a soft-knit jumper, which is currently in its off-season (July 1st). Demand has steadily declined from a peak of ~88 units in February to extremely low levels in June (averaging ~4 units over the last two periods). Current on-hand inventory is 16 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the expected demand of approximately 2 units for Period 21. No new orders are needed at this stage to avoid further holding costs on an item with $1 holding cost vs $4 profit. I am setting L to the promised lead time (0) as history consistently confirms same-period arrival. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) to reflect the current deep summer off-season floor, where demand is minimal.

Carry-over insight: Demand confirms a summer floor: P18-P20 average demand is 4.0 units, stabilizing at extremely low levels for this knit sweater.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. We are dealing with a women's sweater/knit jumper SKU, which is in its deep off-season during the summer months. Historical demand confirm a steady decline from the ~88/week peak in February to extremely low levels recently. For the last 4 periods (P18-P21), demand has been 8, 2, 2, and 6 respectively, averaging 4.5 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 10 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately two weeks of current demand levels. Since the promised lead time remains 0 and all recent orders have arrived with L=0, I will set L to 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current summer floor (average ~4.5 units), and N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility at these low volume levels. The OR backend with these parameters will likely place a minimal to zero order, which is appropriate given the current excess stock relative to the summer demand rate and the high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '591334019' is a knit sweater presently in the deep summer off-season (July). Historical demand has plummeted from a February peak of ~88 units to a current summer floor. In the most recent four periods (P19-P22), demand was 2, 2, 6, and 10 units, respectively. The sudden increase to 10 in P22 may be noise or a minor early-summer fluctuation, but the overall context remains low-demand. On-hand inventory is now 0. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To minimize holding costs while meeting this very low off-season demand, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current summer floor (average ~5.0 units). The OR engine will then calculate a base stock suitable for this low-volume regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a soft-knit jumper, currently in its deep summer off-season (Late July). Demand has consistently hovered between 2 and 10 units since Period 19. Recent demand for Period 23 was 9 units, which followed 10 units in Period 22, indicating a very slight uptick from the seasonal lows of 2-6 units but remaining firmly in the 'summer floor' regime. Inventory is currently at 0 on-hand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs for this low-demand phase, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (P20-P23: 2, 6, 10, 9), which is 6.75 units. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this current low-volume profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled into a late-summer floor of 5-10 units (P21-P23 avg: 8.3), slightly reaching above the deep-summer minimum of 2 units seen in P19-P20.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a lightweight knit jumper, which has been in a sustained off-season demand floor since June. Demand in the most recent periods (P21-P24) has been 6, 10, 9, and 9 respectively, averaging 8.5 units per week. This indicates a very slight increase from the deep-summer low of 2 units seen in P19-P20, but we are still in the off-season. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. Inventory is currently at 1 unit with no units in transit. Since profit ($4) is higher than holding cost ($1), the backend OR logic will target a base stock to cover demand volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this stable late-summer demand level and set lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. The product is a lightweight knit jumper. Demand in Period 25 spiked significantly to 25 units, which is more than double the average of the preceding five periods (P20-P24 avg: 7.2 units). This likely marks the start of a late-summer/pre-autumn transition where light knitwear begins to see renewed interest. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time of 0, I must respond immediately to prevent stockouts like the one in Period 25 (where 15 units of demand were lost). I will set mu_hat explicitly to 25 to match the recent peak demand, and use a higher sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 25 (early August): Demand surged to 25 units, more than double the previous 5-week average of 7.2 units, signaling the end of the summer low for knitwear.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this sweater SKU is undergoing a significant seasonal recovery as we enter mid-August. Period 26 saw a jump to 47 units, up from 25 units in Period 25, and high single digits/low teens in the preceding weeks. This follows the predicted 'end of summer' recovery for knitwear. My previous orders were insufficient (sold 10/25 in P25 and 34/47 in P26) resulting in lost sales. I need to aggressively adjust the forecast to capture this uptrend. L remains 0. I will use the last 2 periods (P25-P26) to calculate mu_hat to reflect the current surge (avg ~36), and sigma_hat will be calculated over the same window to capture the increased volatility of the transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Knitwear demand surged from ~8 units (P21-P24) to 25 (P25) and 47 (P26), indicating a strong seasonal return to market.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this knit jumper has entered a rapid recovery phase as the market transitions from summer into the fall season. Demand has jumped from 25 units (P25) to 79 units (P27), effectively returning to levels seen in February. In both P26 and P27, the system stocked out because demand exceeded the on-hand inventory, which was constrained by the OR backend's cap based on historical (low) demand. To allow the OR engine to order enough units to meet this rising demand, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat. Considering the recent trend (25 -> 47 -> 79), I forecast Period 28 demand at approximately 100 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery into fall season confirmed: Weekly demand increased from 8 units (P24) to 79 units (P27), signaling a return to peak season levels for this knitwear SKU.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29 (late August), and the product is a knit jumper. Demand has rapidly recovered from a summer low (~8 units) to levels seen in early spring. Recent demand values are: P25: 25, P26: 47, P27: 79, P28: 48. This indicates a volatile but strong upward trend as we enter the fall season. In P28, we sold 48 units and have 74 units on-hand. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current seasonal regime, I will use recent_N with N=4 (covering the recovery from P25-P28). This results in a mean demand (mu_hat) of ~50 units per period. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect demand for (1+0) periods. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility of the recovery phase rather than the full-year variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed during fall transition: Demand fluctuated from 79 units (P27) to 48 units (P28), averaging 49.8 over the last 4 weeks (P25-P28).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, the start of the fall season. Demand for this knit sweater has transitioned out of the summer floor (approx. 8 units) into a volatile recovery regime. Over the last three weeks (P27-P29), demand has been 79, 48, and 48 units respectively. This suggests a new stabilization point around 50-60 units as we enter the cooler months. The 'on-hand' inventory of 26 units is insufficient to cover a single period of expected demand. Historical data from early February (P1-P4) showed demand averaging 87.75 units, indicating potential for further growth as autumn progresses. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the current recovery level (avg ~58), while using a slightly higher sigma_hat (N=5) to account for the high volatility seen during this transition (e.g., the jump to 79 and drop back to 48). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall recovery stabilized: Demand for the last two periods (P28-P29) held steady at 48 units, following a peak of 79 in P27. The recovery regime (P25-P29) averages 49.4 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (591334019, knit sweater) is currently in a strong fall recovery phase. Demand surged to 130 units in Period 30, significantly exceeding the previous 5-period average (P25-P29) of 49.4. This confirms the seasonal return to peak levels seen at the beginning of the year (Feb avg ~87). Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 30 (sold 75 vs demand 130). I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the return to peak demand levels (approx. 100 units/period) and recent volatility, while keeping L at 0. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*100 = 200 (to account for review + lead period coverage). sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the high variance observed during recent transition weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Period 30 demand reached 130 units, identifying a shift from the early-fall average of ~49 (P26-P29) to peak-season levels (>100 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (a soft, fine knit sweater) has entered its peak fall/winter season in mid-September (Period 32). Over the last two periods (P30, P31), demand has surged to 130 and 136 units respectively, confirming a new high-demand regime compared to the early-August recovery average of ~49 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts during this peak while balancing the $1 holding cost against $4 profit, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3. This N captures the current peak regime (P29-P31: 48, 130, 136) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the latest volume while accounting for the sharp increase in volatility during the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Peak season demand fully established: Demand in P30-P31 averaged 133 units, a significant jump from the P26-P29 average of 55.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $588.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data confirms a significant move into peak season for this knit sweater. Demand in Period 32 hit 162 units, continuing an upward trend from 130 and 136 in the previous two periods. The average demand for the last three periods (P30-P32) is 142.7 units. With a promised lead time of 0 (consistently observed in history), I will set mu_hat based on these most recent 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the current peak-season level. Sigma_hat is also set using N=3 to capture the increased volatility associated with high-volume sales. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that prioritizes high service levels during this profitable peak window while maintaining the (L+1) coverage requirement.

Carry-over insight: Peak season demand acceleration confirmed: Period 32 demand reached 162 units, bringing the 3-period average (P30-P32) to 142.7 units, a -118% increase from the early-fall average of ~55 units (P26-P29).

Daily Reward (R_t): $628.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (soft fine knit jumper) has entered a hyper-growth phase as it moves into the core autumn/winter season. Significant stockouts have occurred in the last four periods (P30-P33), where actual sales were capped by available on-hand inventory. Most critically, Period 33 demand spiked to 307 units, which is nearly double the Period 32 demand (162) and far exceeds the previous peak-season average of ~143. This indicates a massive seasonal acceleration (possibly a 'stock-up' period or marketing event). Since on-hand is currently 0 and lead time is 0, I must order enough to cover this new peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the steep upward trend (averaging roughly 200 units over P31-P33), but I will use the 'explicit' method for sigma_hat with a high value (100) to account for the extreme volatility observed (ranging from 130 to 307 in four weeks), ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level to prevent further lost sales during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed for late September: Period 33 demand reached 307 units, a 90% increase over Period 32 (162) and a 130% increase over the P30-P31 average (133).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (a soft, fine knit sweater) is currently in its peak fall/winter season. Demand has been highly volatile but generally trending upward, with a very high spike of 307 units in Period 33 followed by 180 units in Period 34. Current date is October 7th, suggesting sustained peak season demand. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 183 units. While P34 demand (180) was lower than P33, it remains significantly higher than the early September levels (~130-136). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect this high-volume regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture current volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high during peak fall season; Period 33-34 average demand is 243.5 units vs Period 30-31 average of 133 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU shows high peak-season demand and volatility, typical for knitwear in mid-October. Recent demand has stabilized but remains high: Period 34 (180 units) and Period 35 (188 units). The surge observed in Period 33 (307 units) appears to be a peak outlier or a temporary spike. Using a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat captures the current high-floor demand of approximately 225 units (average of P33-P35) while somewhat smoothing the Period 33 peak to avoid excessive overstocking as we move deeper into the season. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the observed standard deviation of the last 4 periods (P32-P35) which is approximately 68, ensuring enough safety stock for the high volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-volume peak-season regime (approx. 180-190 units/week), following a major spike of 307 units in Period 33.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (591334019, knit jumper) is currently in its peak fall/winter season in October. Recent demand has stabilized in a high-volume regime after a major spike in late September. Specifically, demand over the last three periods (P34-P36) was 180, 188, and 126 units respectively, averaging 164.7 units. The Period 36 drop to 126 units suggests the initial peak-season acceleration might be cooling into a steady high-volume phase rather than continuing to grow exponentially. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (averaging 250, 180, 188, 126 / 4 = 186 units per period) and a slightly broader recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to account for the high volatility seen during the peak transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized into peak-season steady-state: P34-P36 average demand is 164.7 units, down from the P33 spike of 307 units but significantly higher than pre-September levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the peak season for this knit jumper. Demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime since late September. The last three periods (P35-P37) show demand of 188, 126, and 194 units respectively. While there was a significant spike of 307 units in Period 33, recent performance suggests a steady-state average around 160-170 units. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (P34-P37) to capture this stabilized peak-season demand (average ~172) while accounting for the recent high of 194. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 64, and with no in-transit units, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock level, protecting against the high demand volatility (sigma_hat) observed during this peak period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a fine-knit jumper, which is currently in its peak fall/winter season. Demand has stabilized at a high-volume regime. Looking at the last 5 periods (P34-P38), demand values were [180, 188, 126, 194, 179], yielding an average of 173.4 units per week. While there was a slight dip in P36 (126), the surrounding periods consistently hit the 180-195 range. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized peak-season demand (~173 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period for all recent concludes). I will use recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current volatility (std dev of P34-P38 is approx 27), which is more representative of the peak season than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Peak-season demand stabilized (P34-P38): Average demand is 173.4 units, maintaining the high-volume regime established in September.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, which is deep into the fall/winter peak season for this knit jumper. Demand has remained in a high-volume regime since late September. However, there has been a noticeable deceleration in the last few periods: P37 (194), P38 (179), and P39 (124). The average for this stabilized peak period (P34-P39) is 165.2 units. Given the most recent drop to 124 units, using a slightly shorter window for demand estimation is prudent to avoid overstocking as we move past the absolute peak, while still maintaining high service levels (q=0.8). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-but-fluctuating demand levels (P35-P39 avg is 162.2), ensuring we cover the immediate demand plus a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in Nov: Peak demand is showing signs of moderate cooling from the Sept/Oct highs, with Period 39 demand (124 units) being the lowest since mid-September.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for this knit sweater is cooling down from its October peak, moving into a late-autumn phase. Period 39 demand was 124 units and Period 40 demand was 95 units, significantly lower than the ~170-180 unit average seen throughout October. This suggests a seasonal deceleration as we head towards the end of the year. I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent window (N=3) which captures this cooling trend (P38: 179, P39: 124, P40: 95; Average: 132.7) better than the long-term peak average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Period 39-40 average demand is 109.5 units, down approximately 35% from the October (P35-P38) average of 171.75 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for this knit jumper has confirmed a cooling phase following the Sept/Oct peak. Recent demand samples show a clear step-down: P39 (124), P40 (95), and P41 (71). The average of these last three periods is 96.7 units, compared to the Oct average of ~171. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this decline while maintaining a 0.8 service level (calculated from profit $4 and holding cost $1), I will use the recent N=3 period average for mu_hat (N=3 captures the most recent cooling trend effectively). Sigma_hat will also be set using recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this downward regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase intensified: P39-P41 average demand is 96.7 units, a ~44% decrease from the Oct peak average of 171.75.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (591334019, a knit sweater) is currently in a demand cooling phase following the October peak. Period 42 showed a unexpected demand spike to 149 units (from an average of ~97 in P39-P41), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (Date: Nov 25). Given the date (Dec 2), we should anticipate a post-promotion drop-off while acknowledging that December typically maintains higher baseline demand than summer but lower than the autumn buildup. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0. mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 (P39-P42) to capture the cooling trend balanced by the recent spike, resulting in a mean forecast of approximately 110 units. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility seen between the cooling periods and the promotional spike.

Carry-over insight: Promotional demand spike observed in Period 42 (Nov 25): Demand hit 149 units, interrupting the cooling phase (avg ~97 units P39-P41), likely due to seasonal holiday sales.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), we are evaluating the demand for a women's knit sweater SKU. Recent demand has shown a clear 'cooling' trend following the October peak, interrupted by a significant holiday/Black Friday spike in Period 42 (Nov 25) where demand reached 149 units. Period 43 returned to the cooling trend with demand at 71 units. Looking at the broader transition from peak to late-season: the average demand for P39-P41 was ~97 units, and P43 was 71 units. Given that we are now entering early December, demand is expected to remain in this 'moderate cooling' regime (70-100 units) before potentially dropping further post-holidays. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P39-P43: 124, 95, 71, 149, 71), which averages ~102 units. This N=5 captures the general cooling trend while weight-averaging the promotional spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility caused by the holiday spike. On-hand is 68, and with L=0, the order placed now will satisfy the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike observed: Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a surge to 149 units (+110% vs P41) followed by a return to cooling levels (71 units in P43).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019, which is in the mid-to-late December holiday period. Historically, for this knitwear SKU, we saw a peak in September/October followed by a cooling phase in November (averaging ~97 units). We saw a holiday-related spike in Period 42 (Nov 25) of 149 units, but demand has since stabilized back to cooling levels (71 units in P43, 60 units in P44). Given that we are now past the major gifting spikes and moving towards the post-holiday clearance/winter wind-down, demand is expected to remain in the 60-80 unit range. Lead time has consistently been 0. I will use a N=3 for mu_hat (averaging P42-P44) and sigma_hat to capture the recent holiday volatility while acknowledging the downward trend toward the off-season. This balances the risk of stockouts during late holiday shopping against the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit) for a seasonal item near the end of its peak cycle.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday cooling confirmed: Demand in P43-P44 (65.5 avg) has returned to the Nov cooling regime levels after the brief Thanksgiving/Black Friday spike in P42.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), which is right before Christmas and entering the post-holiday season. Historically, this SKU (a soft knit jumper) saw a major peak in September/October (averaging ~175 units), followed by a cooling phase in November (averaging ~100 units), with a brief holiday spike in Period 42 (149 units). Since then, demand has stabilized at a lower level: the last three periods (P43-P45) show remarkably consistent demand of 71, 60, and 59 units (average ~63.3). This represents the late-winter cooling phase. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to reflect this stabilized post-peak baseline. I will also use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the current reduced volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment. Since current on-hand inventory (76) already covers the current demand level (~63), the OR engine will likely place a small replenishment order to maintain the safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday stabilization confirmed: Demand in the 3 periods following the holiday spike (P43-P45) has stabilized at an average of 63.3 units, reflecting the late-winter cooling regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product is a knit jumper, which has transitioned from its peak fall/winter season (Oct average ~173) into a late-winter cooling phase. Demand in the most recent periods (P43-P46) has been 71, 60, 59, and 42 respectively, showing a clear downward trend as the winter season progresses towards its end. The P44-P46 average is 53.7 units, and the most recent demand of 42 units confirms this decline continues into late December. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as indicated by the 'conclude' messages. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 (covering P43-P46) to capture the current cooling regime (average ~58), and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to capture current volatility. This will ensure base stock levels reflect the decreasing seasonal demand, preventing excessive holding costs as we head into the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Late-winter cooling phase intensified: Demand in P43-P46 has averaged 58.0 units, with a period low of 42 units in P46, indicating the anticipated post-holiday seasonal decline for knitwear.
