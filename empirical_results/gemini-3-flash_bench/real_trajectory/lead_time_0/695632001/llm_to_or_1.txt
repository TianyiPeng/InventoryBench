Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for product 695632001 (Gyda blouse) shows an average of 161 (172, 178, 181, 109, 165). There is no obvious seasonal trend yet, but the dip to 109 on 1/28 suggests some volatility. The promised lead time is 0. Inventory is currently 0 with nothing in-transit. For the initial period, I will use all available historical demand samples (N=5) to set the baseline forecast. Since the promised lead time is 0, the OR engine will target inventory to cover the current period's demand (1+L=1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 is the start of the simulation. For SKU 695632001 (Gyda blouse), we have historical demand from early January to early February showing a steady demand pattern around 161 units/week. In Period 1, we saw an actual lead time of 0 periods (order arrived same-day), which matches the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 was 143, slightly below the historical average. Given the early stage and relatively stable demand (no obvious seasonal spike in February for this item type), I will use the most recent 5 historical samples plus Period 1 to estimate demand. The lead time appears stable at 0, so I will select L=0. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be estimated using recent_N to capture the transition from historical samples into the game environment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, transitioning from late winter into spring. The product is a women's blouse (Gyda blouse), which is likely to see stable or increasing demand as spring fashion cycles begin. Looking at historical arrivals, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand in the last two weeks (143 and 194) is slightly higher than the initial historical samples from January and early February (mean ~161). The current on-hand inventory is low (10 units). I will use a recent demand window to capture the upward trend and maintain the lead time at the observed 0 periods. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base stock that covers current period demand and accounts for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. This is a women's blouse, which generally stays in demand throughout the spring, though we saw a slight dip in late January. Based on the 3 periods of game history provided, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Demand has been fairly stable but shows variance: P1=143, P2=194, P3=156. Combining this with the historical pre-game samples (Feb 4th was 165), the mean demand for the last 4 weeks is approximately 164.5. Given the high profit ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the OR backend's base-stock calculation (critical ratio \u2248 0.95) will naturally favor maintaining a safety stock. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 (3 game periods + 1 latest pre-game sample) to capture the current demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' as the 0-period lead time is clearly established.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2699.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Gyda blouse (Womens Tailoring). Current date is 2019/3/11. Historic demand samples (Jan/Feb) range from 109 to 181 (mean ~161). Game history for Periods 1-4 shows demand of 143, 194, 156, and 145 (mean 159.5). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which is in line with the promised lead time. There is no clear shift in demand regime yet; volatility remains moderate. Given lead time L=0, the base stock targets (L+1)=1 period of demand. I will use the mean of the last 5 samples (P1-P4 + Feb 4th) to set mu_hat and the standard deviation of the last 5 available samples to set sigma_hat.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand (including samples) for the last 10 periods has been: 172, 178, 181, 109, 165, 143, 194, 156, 145, 117. The mean of these 10 samples is 156 with a standard deviation of 26. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). There is no strong evidence of a seasonal regime shift yet, although demand has softened in the last two weeks (145 and 117). However, the standard deviation is stable. I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent 5 periods of demand (which align with the game history) to better reflect current trends while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). Reviewing historical data for the Gyda blouse, we have 11 demand samples (5 pre-game, 6 in-game). Observed demand has stabilized significantly. Pre-game mean (samples 1-5) was 161.0, while game mean (Periods 1-6) is 145.5. The most recent demand (Periods 5-6) showed lower values (117, 118). Since the product is a blouse (potentially transition seasonal) and the current date is late March, demand may be settling into a lower, more consistent spring baseline before any potential Easter or spring holiday spikes. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 6 game periods. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the slightly lower demand mean observed during active play compared to the initial samples, while accurately reflecting the 0-period lead time environment to manage holding costs effectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~145 units/period during Periods 1-6, lower than the pre-game average of 161.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand for the Gyda blouse shows a clear downward trend since Period 2. The mean demand for the most recent 3 periods (Periods 5-7) is 113.33 units, which is significantly lower than the initial pre-game average (~161) and earlier game periods. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and the associated holding cost ($1.0/unit), I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using the most recent 5 samples (Periods 3-7: 156, 145, 117, 118, 105) which better capture this declining regime. Given the product is a blouse, this may reflect a post-early-spring cooling in demand before summer collections arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Demand has continuously declined from a start-of-game average of ~150 to a recent average of ~113 over the last 3 periods (Periods 5-7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3116.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), demand spiked significantly to 203 units, which is much higher than the recent average of ~113. This spike resulted in 39 lost sales and an ending inventory of 0. The date suggests a potential early-spring seasonal bump for a 'soft weave blouse'. While the previous carry-over insight noted a decline, the most recent datum suggests a reversal or a temporary peak. Given L=0, I need to ensure the system orders enough to cover the increased demand volatility while observing if this trend continues. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the recent average including the spike (avg ~136), and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) to account for the increased variance shown in the last few periods. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike detected at Period 8: demand jumped to 203 from a previous 3-period average of ~113, causing stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2505.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632001 (Gyda blouse) has shown a highly volatile demand pattern in the last two periods (Period 8: 203, Period 9: 135) following a downward trend. The date is April 15, which is firmly in the spring retail season. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for highly responsive ordering. Given the recent demand spike in Period 8 and the moderate demand in Period 9, the 'Period 8' insight regarding a volatility spike remains relevant. To adequately cover potential demand fluctuations and avoid a repeat of the Period 8 stockout, I will use a 5-period average (N=5) for mu_hat (averaging 117, 118, 105, 203, 135 \u2248 135.6) and use a recent Window for sigma_hat to capture the heightened volatility seen in the last 3 periods. This balances the risk of overstocking against the high profit margin ($19.0 vs $1.0 holding cost).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the demand history: pre-game samples averaged 161, and Periods 1-10 averaged 139.8 units. However, we've seen significant volatility lately: a peak of 203 in Period 8 followed by a drop to 82 in Period 10. The Carry-over insight for Period 9 flagged this spike. The recent 4-period average (Periods 7-10) is 131.25, while the last 2 periods specifically averaged 108.5. Given the product is a 'Gyda blouse', we might be seeing the tail end of early spring demand or a post-Easter lull. Promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current downward trend and volatility without overreacting solely to the extreme low of Period 10. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the heightened volatility observed between Periods 8-10.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains volatile: Period 8 spike (203) followed by a sharp drop in Period 10 (82). Average demand over the last 4 periods (Periods 7-10) is 131.25 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for the 'Gyda blouse' has been highly volatile over the last few periods (Periods 8-11: 203, 135, 82, 96). The average demand of the last 4 periods is 129 units, but the last two samples (82, 96) suggest a cooling off after the early April spike. However, looking at the full game history and pre-game data (which averaged ~161), the overall mean is around 141. Given the observed zero lead time (L=0) is consistent across all 11 periods, I will continue to use the default calculation for lead time. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), using a recent window of N=5 periods (averaging 124 units) captures the recent deceleration while hedging against the Period 8 spike. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=11 ensures the volatility from the Period 8 spike is factored into the safety stock calculation to avoid future stockouts, while still being responsive to the high coefficient of variation seen in this SKU.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P13 (2019/05/06). The product is a women's blouse, which typically follows fashion seasonality. Historical demand analysis shows a high-demand period followed by a significant decline (Period 10: 82, Period 11: 96) and a slight recovery in Period 12 (121). The average demand over the last four periods (P9-P12) is 108.5 units. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current lower-demand regime while respecting the recent slight uptick and historical volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 108.5 mean plus a buffer for the observed variance, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P9-P12) is 108.5 units, significantly lower than the P1-P6 average of ~145.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632001 (Gyda blouse) is currently in a lower demand regime compared to the start of the game. Over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand has been 135, 82, 96, 121, and 104, averaging 107.6 units. This confirms the carry-over insight from Period 13 that demand has stabilized at a lower level (around 108.5). Although there was a significant spike in Period 8 (203 units) following a decline, recent data suggests a tighter range around the 100-110 mark. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Therefore, I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring we don't over-order based on the high early-game figures (P1-P4) or the isolated outlier in P8, while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the observed volatility in this new regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a lightweight blouse, which typically sees steady demand in spring and early summer. Period 14 demand was 113, and the average for the last 6 periods (P9-P14) is 108.5, indicating a stable regime compared to earlier volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 29, which is low given recent demand levels. I will use recent_N (N=6) for demand mean and volatility to capture this stabilized lower-demand regime while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the persistent ~110 unit weekly requirement. This period is the start of late spring/early summer, so I expect demand to remain consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized around ~110 units (P9-P14 average = 108.5) after the high volatility seen in P8-P10. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/27. The item is a 'Gyda blouse', a light garment. Historically, demand for this SKU has stabilized significantly since Period 11, following a volatile spring transition. In the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15), demand values have been 96, 121, 104, 113, and 81, yielding a mean of approximately 103 units. This confirms the lower demand regime noted in the carry-over insights (~110 units) compared to the start-of-game average. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To optimize for the current regime while accounting for the recent low demand of 81 (P15), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stabilized level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility and avoid over-holding costs associated with the higher historical standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Average demand for Period 11 to Period 15 is 103 units, showing a slight decrease from the previously tracked ~110 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a lightweight blouse (Gyda blouse), which is typically a spring/summer garment. I observe a sustained downward trend in demand since late April. Specifically, the demand for the last five periods (P12-P16) has been 121, 104, 113, 81, and 74 units, averaging 98.6 units. The most recent two periods (81 and 74) suggest the decline is accelerating as we move into June, possibly as the peak spring buying season for this specific item winds down. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this downward shift (avg ~99), which is lower than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, with no missed or delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition: Average demand has shifted from ~110 (P9-P14) to ~99 (P12-P16), with the last two periods (P15-P16) dropping below 85 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Demand has shown a consistent downward trend over the long term, currently transitioning to a lower regime. The average demand for the last five periods (P13-P17) is 87.8, while the average for the last three periods (P15-P17) is only 74.0. The most recent demand (P17) was 67 units. This decline is likely seasonal as the weather warms (blouses with long sleeves being replaced by lighter summer wear). Lead time remains stable at 0. Because of the clear and sustained downward trend, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level of ~88 units without over-reacting to the single lowest point of 67. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility observed in this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Average demand for P13-P17 is 87.8 units, a significant decrease from the P9-P14 average of ~110 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse (695632001) has continued its downward trend. The most recent period (P18) saw a demand of only 48 units, the lowest since the game began. The 5-period average (P14-P18) is now 76.6 units, compared to the previously observed regime of ~88 units (P13-P17). This decline aligns with the seasonal transition in the fashion industry, where a 'soft weave' blouse with long sleeves may see reduced demand as summer (mid-June) progresses. To avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use the most recent 4 periods (P15-P18), which average 67.5 units, capturing the latest downturn. Sigma_hat is also updated to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Average demand for P15-P18 has dropped to 67.5 units, continuing a sustained downward trend from the ~88 range seen in previous weeks.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse is currently in a sustained downward trend as we move further into late June, which is consistent with the product being a 'long sleeve blouse' entering the peak summer season. The average demand over the last four periods (P16-P19) has dropped to 60.75 units, significantly lower than the P13-P17 average of ~88 units and the earlier ~110 range. The most recent demand was 54 units. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in a declining market, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this lower volume regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 across all 19 concluded periods, so 'default' is appropriate. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the lower volatility associated with this lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Average demand for P16-P19 has dropped to 60.75 units, continuing the downward seasonal trend for this long-sleeved item.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved Gyda blouse, which is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as we move into July (Period 21). Historical demand samples from January/February were around 170 units, but recent demand has dropped consistently. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 60.2 units (74, 67, 48, 54, 58). Given the hot summer weather (July 1st), it is highly likely demand for long-sleeved tailoring will remain low or decrease further. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage holding costs effectively while maintaining a service level for the lower demand regime, I will set L to 'default' (0), mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing the current ~60 unit level), and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current lower volatility. This keeps the base stock aligned with the seasonal downturn.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower seasonal level: Average demand for P16-P20 is 60.2 units, down significantly from the start-of-year levels, reflecting seasonal loss of interest in long-sleeved items in summer.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a long-sleeved blouse 'Gyda blouse', which is seasonally less relevant in July. The current date is 2019-07-08. Recent demand has been significantly lower than the start-of-year average, though Period 21 saw a slight uptick to 85 units, causing a stockout of the 78 units available on-hand. Despite this minor spike, the overall trend since Period 13 remains low. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is (67+48+54+58+85)/5 = 62.4 units. Given the transition into mid-summer, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the recent slight increase and ensure availability while respecting the generally lower seasonal regime. Lead time is consistently 0.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a long-sleeved blouse 'Gyda blouse', which typically sees lower demand in peak summer. However, we have observed a significant demand rebound over the last two periods (P21: 85 and P22: 103), which suggests either a mid-summer clearance effect or an early transition in shopper behavior. These values are significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (P16-P20 average ~60). We have also experienced two consecutive stockouts (0 ending inventory in P21 and P22) because the inventory was insufficient to meet this unexpected surge. Given the current date (July 15), we need to capture this upward shift in demand while acknowledging the volatility. I will use recent_N with N=4 to balance the lower June values and the higher July values (average of P19-P22 is approx 75). Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected in July: Demand increased from a June average of ~53 (P17-P20) to 94 over the last two periods (P21-P22), resulting in back-to-back stockouts.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a long-sleeved 'Gyda blouse'. We previously observed a significant demand drop during June (P18-P20), followed by an unexpected rebound in early July (P21-P22: average ~94), which caused stockouts. Period 23 saw a correction back down to 66 units. Reviewing the July sequence (85, 103, 66), the average is approx 85 units. Current on-hand is 48. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (P21-P23) to capture this recent July volatility and rebound, setting N=3. This results in a higher safety stock than the June levels but lower than the start-of-year average, reflecting the current mid-summer distribution.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound in July (P21-P23) shows an average of 84.7 units, significantly higher than the June average of ~53 units, but stabilizing after the initial spike.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a long-sleeved blouse. Demand has recently been highly volatile: a July rebound spiked demand to 85 and 103 (Periods 21-22), followed by a sharp drop to 66 and 25 (Periods 23-24). The Period 24 demand of 25 is a significant outlier on the low side, possibly indicating the end of the July mid-season interest or a return to the lower June levels (~53). However, given the profit margin ($19) vs holding cost ($1), it is safer to protect against the higher July average while acknowledging the recent drop. I will use the mean of the last 4 periods (P21-P24), which is 69.75, to balance the recent spike and the most recent drop. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this recent context.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in July: demand fluctuated from spikes of ~94 (P21-P22) to a sharp drop of 25 in P24. The 4-period July average (P21-P24) is 69.75 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). Historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern: high demand in Feb/March/April (~140), a dip in June (~55), and a rebound/volatility in July (averaging ~67 across P21-P25 with peaks up to 103). The 'Gyda blouse' is a long-sleeved item, typically seeing a secondary peak in late August/September for the 'back-to-school' or 'autumn' transition. Recent demand (P21-P25) has been 85, 103, 66, 25, 58. The average over these 5 periods is 67.4. Given the volatility and the expected seasonal uplift in August, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the July-August transition while sigma_hat will also use N=5 to account for the high variance (std dev from 25 to 103). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained July-August rebound: Demand increased from a June average of ~53 (P17-P20) to a July-early August average of ~67 (P21-P25), with significant weekly volatility (range 25-103).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are managing a long-sleeved blouse. After a significant demand slump in June (average ~53), demand has rebounded and stabilized in July and early August (Periods 21-26). The demand for the last 6 periods (P21-P26) has been: 85, 103, 66, 25, 58, 90. This averages 71.2 units per period with significant volatility (std dev ~28). The spike to 90 last period confirms that demand remains higher than the summer lows. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this new July-August regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in July-August: Average demand (P21-P26) is 71.2 units, up from the June average of ~53, but with high weekly volatility (range 25-103).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Gyda blouse' (long-sleeved). Current date is 2019/8/19. Historical demand shows a seasonal dip in June/early July followed by a late summer resurgence. Average demand from Period 21 to Period 27 (July-August) is 76.3, compared to the June average of ~53. Recent demand has been high (90 in P26, 107 in P27). As we approach late August and September, demand for long-sleeved items typically remains stable or increases. Lead time has consistently been 0. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7, covering the summer recovery) to capture the current mean of ~76. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to reflect the significant volatility (range 25-107) observed in this period, ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized for late Summer (P21-P27): Average demand is 76.3 units, up from the June average of ~53, with continued high weekly volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August, approaching the end of summer and the start of the Autumn retail season. Historically, for this SKU, demand has stabilized in the 75-80 unit range during July and August (P21-P28 average: 75.5 units). Recent demand in Period 28 was 67 units, following a peak of 107 in Period 27. Given the 'Gyda blouse' is a long-sleeved item, we expect demand to potentially increase as we move into September. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the late-summer demand regime which captures both the spikes (107, 103) and the lulls (25), providing a balanced forecast of approximately 75 units per period. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue leveraging the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer (P21-P28) demand regime stabilized around 75.5 units, up from the June average of ~53 units, but characterized by high week-to-week volatility (range 25-107).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved blouse. Historical demand analysis shows a significant seasonal decline in late spring/early summer (June), followed by a volatile 'late summer' rebound (July-August) where demand averaged approximately 75.5 units (P21-P28) but peaked as high as 107. As we move into September, we enter the Fall season, which typically favors long-sleeved items like this Gyda blouse. Recent demand over the last 4 periods (P26-P29) has been 90, 107, 67, and 66, averaging 82.5. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the entire July-August-September transition period (starting from P21), as this provides a stable baseline for the current regime while accounting for the recent volatility. This N=9 reflects the period since the last meaningful regime shift (the end of the summer trough) and encompasses the higher volatility seen recently, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat are responsive to potential further increases in demand as cooler weather arrives.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are entering the fall season for this long-sleeved 'Gyda blouse'. Period 30 saw a significant demand surge to 141 units, which follows a late-summer stabilization around ~75 units. This spike suggests a seasonal transition as weather cools, similar to the early-year demand levels (~140-160 range). Period 30 resulted in a stockout (on-hand is 0). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To respond to this seasonal shift, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to weight the recent upward trend (P28-P30 average: 91.3) more heavily than the full history, while keeping safety stock robust via the default sigma_hat to account for the intrinsic SKU volatility.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand pivot detected in September: Demand increased to 141 in P30, likely marking the end of the summer low (~60-75) and a return to higher demand for long-sleeved items.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32 (mid-September). Demand for this long-sleeved blouse (Gyda blouse) has hit a clear seasonal pivot point. After a summer low of ~60-75 units, demand jumped to 141 in P30 and 181 in P31. This aligns with the transition to cooler autumn weather. Both of the last two periods resulted in stockouts, indicating the previous forecasts were too low for this shift. I am increasing mu_hat using N=3 to capture this recent spike (average of P29-P31 is 129, but specifically P30-P31 reflect the new regime). Using explicit values to ensure we cover the current momentum (approx 180 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 0. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility seen during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand pivot confirmed in September: Demand surged to 141 (P30) and 181 (P31), rebounding from summer lows (~75) as long-sleeved items regain seasonal relevance.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal pivot for the Gyda blouse (long-sleeved item) is now fully confirmed as we move into late September. Demand in P30-P32 (141, 181, 180) shows a distinct shift back to high-volume sales compared to the summer lows (avg ~75). The average demand over the last three periods is 167.3. Given the product's seasonal relevance in autumn and the consistency of the last two readings (~180), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this high-demand regime. This provides a forecast of (1+0)*167.3 = 167.3. I will also use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility associated with this volume jump. The actual lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand rebound fully established in September: 3-period average (P30-P32) is 167.3 units, returning to start-of-year levels as long-sleeved items gain relevance for Autumn.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A severe seasonal demand spike occurred in Period 33 (September 23), with demand jumping to 451 units, causing a significant stockout. This matches the product description (long-sleeved blouse) and the onset of Autumn/Fall weather. The previous 3-period average (P30-P32) of 167.3 units was completely overshadowed by this surge. Given that Periods 30-33 now show a clear upward trajectory (141, 181, 180, 451), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 450 to capture this new peak demand level and prevent further stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for the high volatility observed during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Major seasonal peak confirmed: Demand surged to 451 units in P33, a nearly 3x increase over the early-September average (~167), reflecting high seasonal relevance for long-sleeved womenswear in late September.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4583.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a Gyda blouse with long sleeves, a category that typically sees its primary peak in the transition to Autumn. We are currently in Period 35 (2019/10/07). In Period 33, demand spiked dramatically to 451, followed by 264 in Period 34. This suggests the peak 'back-to-office/Autumn' surge may have crested, but demand remains significantly higher than the summer baseline (~75 units). The on-hand inventory is 433 units. Given the high profitability ($19) versus holding cost ($1), we should maintain high service levels. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (P30-P34: 141, 181, 180, 451, 264), which is 243.4. This allows the backend OR logic to calculate a base stock that covers these recent higher volumes while accounting for the significant variance observed during the Period 33 surge. The lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Summer peak phase confirmed: Demand surged to a peak of 451 (P33) and corrected to 264 (P34), establishing a new high-volume regime for October compared to summer lows.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 36 (mid-October). The product is a long-sleeved blouse, which is currently in its peak seasonal window. Recent demand has stabilized in a high-volume regime following the major late-September spike: P33 (451, stockout), P34 (264), and P35 (177). The 3-period post-peak average (P33-P35) using actual demand (including the stockout potential) is roughly 297 units. Given the transition from early autumn peaks toward late autumn stability, I expect demand to hover between the 170-260 range. On-hand inventory is 272. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture this high-volume regime effectively, while sigma_hat will also look at the last 3 periods to account for the recent demand variance, ensuring the backend maintains a safe base stock for potential late-October fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak Autumn demand regime: Demand has stabilized at a higher level than summer, with an average of ~220 units (P34-P35) following the P33 peak of 451.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3292.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the Gyda blouse (long-sleeved) shows stabilization in the autumn regime following the late September peak of 451. For the most recent three periods (P34-P36), demand has averaged 210.7 units (264, 177, 191). This is significantly higher than the summer lows (~75) but lower than the anomalous spike. Current on-hand inventory is 337 units. Given the seasonality of a long-sleeved blouse in late October, demand is expected to remain firm but likely stable or slightly declining as winter approaches. I am setting mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this established post-peak autumn regime. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 periods to capture current volatility without being skewed by the massive P33 outlier. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak autumn demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P34-P36 is 210.7 units, following the P33 seasonal peak of 451.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632001 (long-sleeved blouse) has entered its peak autumn demand season. Following a major seasonal spike in late September (P33: 451), demand has stabilized at a higher autumn level. The average demand for the most recent four periods (P34-P37) is 220.5 units (264, 177, 191, 250). In Period 37, demand was 250 units, which exhausted much of the existing safety stock, leaving only 87 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 0. To prevent stockouts during this high-volume period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current autumn regime (averaging ~221 units per period). This ensures the base stock reflects the recent 200+ unit demand levels rather than the much lower summer averages.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Average demand for P34-P37 is 220.5 units, significantly higher than the early September average (~167) and summer lows (~75).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a high-demand Autumn/Winter regime for this long-sleeved blouse. Recent demand history shows a stabilization at a higher level following the late September peak: Period 34 (264), P35 (177), P36 (191), P37 (250), and P38 (271). The average demand over these last 5 periods is 230.6 units, reflecting sustained interest as colder weather sets in. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stabilized high-volume regime while avoiding the outlier peak of 451 from P33. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the current volatility in this high-demand phase. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated seasonal demand and protects against stockouts during this critical sales period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P34-P38 is 230.6 units, up from the early September average of ~167 and summer lows.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a long-sleeved blouse, which is currently in a high-demand Autumn/Winter regime (P34-P38 average ~230). The most recent demand was 167 (P39), suggesting a slight cooling or fluctuation within this high regime. The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the game. Given the profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (q=0.95), making it important to cover demand peaks. Looking at the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand follows a high-volume but volatile pattern: 264, 177, 191, 250, 271, 167. The average for these 6 periods is 220. This period, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to capture the post-peak Autumn stabilization while maintaining enough inventory to prevent stockouts during demand spikes like those seen in P37/P38.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-demand regime stabilization: Average demand for P34-P39 is 220.0 units, with continued volatility (range 167-271) following the P33 seasonal peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2263.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a long-sleeved blouse, which is highly seasonal for Autumn/Winter. Demand peaked in late September (P33: 451 units) and has since stabilized in a high-volume regime. The average demand for the last seven periods (P34-P40) is approximately 207 units, although the last two periods have shown a softening (P39: 167, P40: 128). This decline might indicate the start of a late-season taper as we approach late November. However, given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the cost of understocking remains high. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To balance the recent downward trend with the overall high-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak Autumn behavior (P34-P40) while allowing for the lower recent values to naturally pull the base stock down. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter stabilizes post-peak: Average demand for P34-P40 is 206.9 units, significantly higher than summer levels, but showing a recent softening in P39-P40 (~148 average).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25 (Late Autumn/Early Winter). We are managing a long-sleeved blouse, which has shown a high-demand regime since late September (Period 33). The autumn regime average (P34-P41) is approximately 202.8 units (264, 177, 191, 250, 271, 167, 128, 174). While demand softened in P39-P40, P41 showed a slight recovery to 174 units. Given we are approaching the holiday season (late November/December), demand for this category often remains elevated or experiences further spikes. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this post-peak autumn regime while acknowledging the recent slight downward trend compared to the October highs. Sigma_hat is set using N=8 to reflect the high volatility (range 128-271) seen in this regime. This ensures a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts during potential pre-holiday surges while respecting the recent mean.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter late-season stability: Average demand for P34-P41 is 202.8 units, maintaining a significantly higher volume than summer levels (~75) despite weekly volatility between 128 and 271 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5491.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), we experienced a massive demand spike of 722 units, which is significantly higher than any previous observation (previous peak was 451 in P33). This spike cleared all on-hand inventory, resulting in a stockout. Given the date (Dec 2) and the product (long-sleeved blouse), this likely reflects a core holiday shopping peak or Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact. The 'arrived=165' confirm that lead time remains 0. I will prioritize capturing this new high-demand regime using recent_N (N=9, covering the shift from November to December) to ensure \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are aggressive enough to prevent further stockouts during the holiday season. The service level is naturally high (95%) because the backend target q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected in Period 42: Demand spiked to 722 units, far exceeding the Autumn average of ~200 units, likely due to peak gift-shopping season.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 is Monday, Dec 9, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday/pre-Christmas shopping window. Period 42 saw a massive spike of 722 units (Holiday surge). Period 43 demand corrected to 177, which aligns with the stabilized Autumn/Winter average (P34-P41 avg ~203). Because the 'Gyda blouse' (long-sleeved garment) remains highly relevant for the winter season and holiday gifting, I expect demand to remain elevated but likely lower than the extreme spike seen in P42. The on-hand inventory is 380, which is sufficient to cover another 'normal' high-volume week (~200 units) but risky if another 500+ unit spike occurs. To handle the remaining holiday weeks until the end of the year (Period 47), I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 240 units to ensure the base stock is high enough to absorb a late-December surge without over-stocking as we approach the game end. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the high volatility seen since the late September pivot.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peaked at Period 42 (722 units). Post-peak demand stabilized at 177 (P43), aligned with Autumn average of ~203.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a long-sleeved blouse, which experienced a massive holiday peak in Period 42 (722 units). Since then, demand has stabilized. Period 43 demand was 177 and Period 44 was 216, averaging 196.5 units. This aligns with the 'post-peak' Autumn/Winter regime identified in the carry-over insights (approx. 200-230 units). Current on-hand inventory is 307 units. With a lead time of 0, I want to ensure the target base stock (mu_hat + safety stock) covers the incoming period's demand. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the average of the last 5 periods (P40-P44), which includes the outlier at P42 and the subsequent stabilization, providing a robust buffer without over-ordering as we approach year-end. This results in a mu_hat set to (1+0) times the average of {128, 174, 722, 177, 216} = 283.4. Given the massive spike at P42, I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to ensure the backend accounts for this recent extreme volatility in its safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization: Following the P42 spike (722), demand has returned to the Autumn/Winter average, with P43-P44 averaging 196.5 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. This falls in the week leading up to Christmas and the start of post-holiday sales. Historically, Period 42 saw a major holiday spike (722 units), but demand has since normalized back to the Autumn/Winter average (P43-P45 average = 195.33 units). With Christmas occuring this week and the game ending next period (Period 47), demand may either spike again for last-minute shopping/gift cards or decline sharply. Given the high on-hand inventory (497 units) relative to the recent 3-period average, the risk of stockout is significantly lower than the risk of high holding costs for the final game period. I will set the demand mean (mu_hat) using recent_N=3 to capture the post-holiday stabilization (avg ~195) and use a conservative sigma_hat (recent_N=3) to handle potential end-of-year volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 based on all observed history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2043.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the final period for this SKU. The product is a long-sleeved blouse, which has passed its major seasonal peaks (late September and the late November holiday surge). Recent demand for Periods 43-46 (post-holiday) has normalized to an average of 178.25 units (177, 216, 193, 127). The current on-hand inventory is 370 units, which more than covers twice the recent average demand. Given that the promised lead time is 0 and this is the final period, the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory to reduce holding costs. Since on-hand inventory (370) is significantly higher than any recent non-peak demand, I will set mu_hat to a conservative estimate reflecting the post-holiday dip (recent_N=4) and maintain default sigma_hat. No new order will likely be triggered by the backend due to the high on-hand balance relative to the forecast.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization: Average demand for P43-P46 is 178.3 units, confirming a return to standard Autumn/Winter levels after the P42 spike.
