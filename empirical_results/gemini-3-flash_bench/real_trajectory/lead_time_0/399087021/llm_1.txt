The current date is 2019-02-11, which is post-New Year but before any major spring seasonal peaks. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in-transit, I need to place an order immediately to cover the expected demand for Period 1.

The volatility is significant, but the mean is clearly established near the early-year levels. Lead time is confirmed as 0, allowing for same-period arrival. On-hand inventory is 32. Given the high profit margin ($19.0) versus low holding cost ($1.0), it is optimal to maintain a high service level.
