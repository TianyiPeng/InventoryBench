Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 677930023, which is a lightweight sweatshirt (Queen Sweater). The available demand history (late Jan to early Feb) shows a significant downward trend: 229, 49, 68, 62, 42. The initial high demand (229) appears to be an outlier or part of a previous regime (potentially post-holiday clearance or early spring launch). Given we have no inventory and the promised lead time is 0, we need to order immediately. I will use the recent_N method (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable, lower demand level (avg ~55 units/period) rather than being skewed by the initial 229. Actual lead time is currently assumed to be the promised 0 until proven otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a lightweight sweatshirt (Queen Sweater). Historically, demand for this SKU has been high in early January (229) and then stabilized between 42-68 units per week. Period 1 demand was 36, confirming a lower post-holiday regime. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (actual lead time 0). To set OR parameters, I will use a conservative look-back. Since demand shifted from a high of 229 to a stable range (42, 68, 62, 42, 36) over the last 5 weeks, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture this 'Jersey Basic' baseline demand without over-reacting to the P1 dip or the January spike. L remains 0. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 samples to account for current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, representing a post-winter/early spring transition. Demand for 'Queen Sweater' (Basics) shows an upward trend over the last two periods (36 units in P1, 55 units in P2) compared to the initial sample historical average (~90 units but with high variance). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in P1 and P2 arrivals. We have 8 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. To ensure high service levels while demand is increasing from its recent lows, I'll use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 (including the current history) to capture the recent mean growth which is around 45.5 units. Sigma_hat will use the same N=3 to track recent volatility. The L parameter remains 'default' since the 0-period lead time is performing as promised.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4 (2019-03-04), we are managing a 'Queen Sweater' (lightweight sweatshirt). Promised lead time is 0. Analysis of the first 3 periods confirms the actual lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 arrived in the same respective periods). Demand history is as follows: Jan peak (229), followed by a lower cluster in late Jan/Feb (49, 68, 62, 42), and recent game demand (36, 55, 48). The mean of the recent game demand is approx 46.3. As we move into March, demand for lightweight sweaters often remains stable or increases slightly before the spring drop-off. On-hand inventory is low (5 units), and there is no in-transit stock. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the current game demand regime more accurately than the long-term historical mean (which is skewed by the Jan 7th outlier). L is set to 'default' as 0-day lead time is verified.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a lightweight sweater. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has fluctuated between 31 and 229, but the recent 4 periods since the game start have shown a more stable range (31-55). Specifically, demand from Period 1 to 4 was 36, 55, 48, and 31. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. There are no missing shipments or pipeline inventory. Given we are in early March, we are moving away from peak winter, which explains why the initial sample of 229 (Jan 7) has not repeated. I will use the last 4 periods to estimate demand mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current post-winter stable regime, while keeping L at the default 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 677930023 (Queen Sweater) is in the 'Divided Basics' category, which typically sees steady demand but can be influenced by seasonal transitions. The current date is 2019/3/18 (early spring). Looking at the historical demand (Periods 1-5 and pre-game data), there was a peak in early February (55 units in P2 following the pre-game high of 229 in early January, which was likely a clearance or holiday peak). Recent demand in Period 4 (31) and Period 5 (23) shows a downward trend compared to the mean. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 5 observed periods. Since the inventory position is 29 and recent demand is averaging around 27 units (P4-P5), but historical mean is higher, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining enough safety stock for the high service level required (Profit $4 / Holding $1 gives a target service level of 80%). N=3 is chosen for demand to reflect the most recent regime after the February peak.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th (Period 7). The product is a lightweight sweater ('Queen Sweater'). Historical demand since Period 1 (Feb 11) shows a clear downward trend (36, 55, 48, 31, 23, 20), consistent with the transition from winter to spring in the Northern Hemisphere. The initial high demand peaked in mid-February and has significantly cooled as temperatures rise. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 6 concluded periods, matching the promised lead time. Given the clear demand regime shift starting around Period 4, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower, less volatile demand level (mean ~25). This prevents over-ordering for a seasonal product that is trending down. L remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P4 (Mar 4): demand decreased from P1-P3 (avg 46.3) to P4-P6 (avg 24.7), likely due to seasonal transition to spring for this sweater SKU.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU 677930023 continues to show a sustained demand regime shift. The initial demand (P1-P3) averaged 46.3 units/period, but since P4 (Mar 4), the demand has settled into a lower range (P4-P7 average: 23.75). The most recent demand was 21 units. This aligns with the seasonal transition away from sweaters ('lightweight sweatshirt fabric') as spring progresses. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=4 to capture this new regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that reflects the current lower demand level and avoids excess holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: P4-P7 average demand is 23.75 units compared to P1-P3 average of 46.3 units (-48.7%). Lead time consistently confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a lightweight sweater ('Queen Sweater'), which has shown a clear downward demand shift as spring progresses. Analysis of recent demand across the last 5 periods (P4-P8) shows an average of 23.0 units (31, 23, 20, 21, 20), which is a significant and sustained drop from the initial weeks (P1-P3 avg: 46.3). The demand in the last three periods (P6-P8) has further stabilized around 20 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory as the season warms up, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime while maintaining a responsive service level (profit $4 vs cost $1).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a lightweight sweater, which typically sees declining demand as spring progresses into summer. We have observed a sustained demand regime shift starting in Period 4. The average demand for Periods 1-3 was 46.3, while the average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P4-P9) has dropped to 21.6 units. The last three periods specifically show a slight further decline (21, 20, 15). Lead time is consistently 0. To prevent overstocking during this downward seasonal trend, I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the current lower demand level and volatility since the shift. This balances the need for service level against the risk of high holding costs for a seasonal item.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: P4-P9 average demand is 21.6 units compared to P1-P3 average of 46.3 units (-53%). Seasonality confirms declining interest in sweaters as mid-April temperatures rise.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 11 (April 22nd). The product is a lightweight sweater. In Period 10, demand spiked to 37 units (compared to the previous 7-period average of ~21.6), resulting in a stockout (sold 27, ending on-hand 0). This spike is likely a late-season 'Easter' effect or a temporary weather dip, as the general trend remains downward for spring. However, our safety stock was too lean. Lead time is consistently 0. I will adjust the mu_hat to account for the recent spike while acknowledging the seasonal decline by using a recent_N of 4 (covering the last 4 weeks: 20, 15, 37, plus the pre-history sample of 42). This balances the recent volatility without overreacting to a single spike. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture the increased variance from the Period 10 outlier.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the demand for this 'Queen Sweater' spiked dramatically to 131 units, up from an average of ~21 units since March. April 22nd corresponds to the week leading up to or including Easter Monday in many regions, and potentially a major mid-season promotion. However, as a 'lightweight sweatshirt fabric' item entering late April/May, this spike is likely a clearance event or a specific holiday peak rather than a new sustained regime. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (averaging P9: 15, P10: 37, P11: 131) will result in a forecast of 61 units, which balances responding to the spike while acknowledging it is likely an outlier. L remains 'calculate' (0) based on perfect historical reliability. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the increased volatility without over-penalizing the forecast due to the singular Period 11 extreme.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Significant demand outlier (131 units) observed on 2019-04-22, likely due to clearance or holiday event; monitoring for reversal to lower spring averages.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently at zero following two consecutive periods of extreme demand (131 and 179 units) that far exceeded historical averages for this 'lightweight sweatshirt' SKU. We are now in early May (2019-05-06). While these spikes might suggest a clearance event or sudden trend, the product description (lightweight sweatshirt) suggests some utility in late spring. To recover from the stockouts while hedging against the possibility that the demand spike was a temporary clearance-driven event rather than a sustained shift, I will use a high-alpha EWMA (0.7) for mu_hat. This allows the forecast to react aggressively to the recent surge while still being influenced by the historical context. L remains 0 based on consistent delivery history. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the extremely high volatility seen in the last three periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge observed P11-P12: Demand spiked from an average of ~20 to over 150 units, resulting in back-to-back stockouts. This contradicts the expected spring decline for sweaters and may indicate a clearance event or local trend.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand dropped to 70 units from the massive spikes in P11 (131) and P12 (179). This confirms that while the 'spring sweater decline' was temporarily interrupted by a major event (likely a clearance sale or specific promotion), the peak of that event has passed. However, demand remains significantly higher than the pre-spike average of ~21 units. Period 13 demand (70) suggests we are now in a 'post-peak' regime. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the volatility and high volume of this recent period (P11-P13) while allowing the OR backend to adjust for the downward trend from 179 to 70. On-hand inventory is 86, and lead time is consistently 0. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 balances the risk of further stockouts against the risk of overstocking a seasonal item at the end of its cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike (P11-P12) has peaked and is declining: P12=179, P13=70. New demand regime P11-P13 average is 126.7 units, significantly above previous baseline of 21.6 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand spike for the Queen Sweater (P11-P12) has clearly dissipated, with demand dropping from a peak of 179 in P12, to 70 in P13, and now 50 in P14. This confirms the 'clearance event' hypothesis, and demand is now trending back toward a lower baseline, likely hampered by the late May seasonality (warmer weather). On-hand inventory is currently high (123 units) due to the large orders placed during the surge. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid further overstocking and high holding costs ($1.0/unit), I am reducing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 (averaging 70 and 50) to capture the cooling trend while acknowledging it remains higher than the pre-spike level of ~20. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to incorporate the recent high volatility into the buffer calculation, ensuring we don't stock out if there's a smaller secondary wave of clearance sales.

Carry-over insight: Post-clearance demand regression: Demand has dropped for two consecutive periods after the P12 peak (179 -> 70 -> 50), confirming the spike was temporary. Inventory levels are now surplus relative to current demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 677930023 (Queen Sweater) is in Period 16 (2019/5/27). Demand analysis shows that the significant spike observed between Period 11 and Period 13 (likely a clearance event or temporary trend) has fully subsided. Demand in Period 15 was 21 units, which perfectly aligns with the pre-spike spring baseline of ~21.6 units established between P4 and P9. Current on-hand inventory is 102 units, which is high relative to this returned baseline (approximately 5 periods of cover). Actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods. To avoid further accumulation of holding costs and allow inventory to burn down toward the sustainable spring/summer level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N method reflecting the stabilized lower demand regime. N=6 is chosen to capture the data from the recent period (P15) plus the stable period before the spike (P7-P10, plus initial spring settling P4-P6), effectively bridging the outlier. This will result in a low base stock and zero additional orders until inventory reaches appropriate levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression to spring baseline confirmed: Period 15 demand (21 units) matches the P4-P9 average of 21.6 units, signaling the end of the P11-P13 clearance spike.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 677930023 has returned to its spring/summer baseline after a significant clearance-driven spike in periods 11-13 (which saw demand up to 179 units). Periods 15 and 16 recorded demand of 21 and 24 units, respectively, aligning perfectly with the P4-P9 average of 21.6 units. Given the current date (June 3), this lightweight sweater is in a low-demand seasonal trough. We currently have 109 units on-hand, which is roughly 5 periods of supply relative to the current mean. To avoid accruing unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period) while maintaining a high service level for the small remaining demand, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P14-P16) to reflect this stability. Lead time is consistently 0. The system will likely place a zero or minimal order due to the high on-hand surplus.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (a lightweight sweater) has transitioned back into its summer baseline demand regime after a significant clearance spike in late April/early May (P11-P13). Period 17 sales dropped to 8 units, confirming the low demand expected for this product category in June. Currently, on-hand inventory is 101 units, which is extremely high (approximately 4-5 weeks of coverage) relative to the recent baseline of ~20 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To minimize holding costs while the excess inventory is depleted, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the post-spike baseline (P15-P17) but with a slightly wider window (N=3) to account for the reversion. The L parameter is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression to summer baseline confirmed: P15-P17 demand average is 17.7 units, reflecting seasonal decline for sweaters in June.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 677930023, a lightweight sweater, has significantly declined as we enter mid-June (summer season). The most recent three periods (P16-P18) show a sharp drop in demand (24, 8, and 5 units respectively), averaging 12.3 units. This reinforces the previous insight that the spike in P11-P13 was a temporary clearance event. Current on-hand inventory is 96 units, which is extremely high (nearly 8x the current average weekly demand). Given the high holding cost ($1.00 relative to $4.00 profit) and the low service level requirement (~80%), the OR backend will correctly minimize orders when the on-hand inventory exceeds the base stock calculation. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current late-spring/early-summer demand regime (P15-P18), which averages 9.75 units, to ensure the base stock targets reflect the current low-demand environment and allow the system to bleed off the excess inventory. Lead time is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P16-P18): Average weekly demand has fallen to 12.3 units as temperatures rise, following the May clearance spike.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is currently in a very low seasonal demand phase (summer), with weekly demand dropping from 8 to 5 to 4 units over the last three periods (P17-P19). The current on-hand inventory of 92 units is significantly higher than any projected demand for the immediate future, representing over 20 weeks of stock at the current run rate. Lead time is consistently 0. To prevent further accumulation of units and minimize holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P16-P19) to reflect the summer trough. The OR backend will see that (on-hand + in-transit) > base_stock and will correctly place no new orders. No new carry-over insights are needed as the summer baseline was already established in Period 19.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is currently in a deep summer trough, as evidenced by the demand progression: 8, 5, 4, 1 in the most recent periods. This matches the seasonal expectation for a sweater in July. The current on-hand inventory of 91 units is extremely high relative to this low demand (over 90 weeks of cover at the current rate). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid further holding costs on an item that is effectively out of season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P17-P20) to reflect this 'low-demand' regime. The OR backend will see that on-hand inventory (91) is far greater than the target base stock, resulting in 0 units being ordered, which is the desired outcome to bleed off excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed (P17-P20): Weekly demand has decayed to near-zero (avg 4.5 units, most recent 1 unit), confirming minimal summer interest for this sweater SKU.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, the heart of the summer season. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm that this SKU (a lightweight sweatshirt) has entered its deepest seasonal trough. Demand over the last five periods (P17-P21) has been minimal: 8, 5, 4, 1, and 4 units respectively, averaging 4.4 units per week. With an on-hand inventory of 87 units and zero in-transit, the current stock covers approximately 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid further holding costs on an already overstocked position, the base stock level must be kept at a minimum. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering the summer trough periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current low-demand regime, which will result in a zero order since on-hand inventory significantly exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for this sweater SKU has reached a summer trough, with observations over the last five periods (P18-P22) being 5, 4, 1, 4, and 0 units respectively (average 2.8 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 87 units, which is significantly higher than the current demand requirement. Given the low demand and high holding cost ($1.00/unit) relative to profit ($4.00/unit), the priority is to avoid ordering any additional units until the existing surplus is cleared or seasonal demand returns. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this low-demand state, while relying on the existing stock to cover all needs.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough persists: P18-P22 average demand is 2.8 units, confirming negligible interest in sweaters during mid-summer. Significant inventory surplus (87 units) relative to demand forecast.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Queen Sweater) is currently in a deep summer demand trough, with historical demand over the last 6 periods (P18-P23) averaging only 2.67 units per week. The current date is July 22, 2019, which is the height of summer, confirming the seasonal irrelevance of this product. On-hand inventory is 85 units, which provides over 30 weeks of coverage at the current consumption rate. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect this low-demand regime. This will result in a base stock significantly lower than the current 85 units on hand, prompting the OR backend to place an order of 0 units to avoid further holding costs on surplus stock.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in the depths of the summer demand trough for the 'Queen Sweater'. Historically, demand has been extremely low since June (averaging ~4 units per week from P17-P24). Period 24 saw a slight uptick to 12 units, but this is still well below our current on-hand inventory of 73 units. With a Profit of $4 and a Holding Cost of $1, the critical service level (q) is 0.8, but even with this service level, our current stock covers over 6 weeks of recent average demand. No new orders are needed as we continue to wind down the surplus from the May clearance spike. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this low-demand summer regime (avg ~3.8), and keep Lead Time at 'default' as it has consistently been 0 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-05. We are transitioning from the summer demand trough (June-July) into the early fall season. Demand for '677930023' (Lightweight Sweatshirt) has shown the first signs of recovery, increasing from near-zero in early July to 12 units (P24) and 20 units (P25). This aligns with seasonal 'Back to School' timing where lightweight sweaters begin to regain relevance. Currently, we have 53 units on-hand with no in-transit. Given the historical average during the spring (approx. 20-25 units) and the recent upturn, demand is likely to continue increasing, but the current inventory of 53 units is sufficient to cover approximately 2.5 periods of the current 20-unit demand level. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, we can afford to be conservative and allow existing stock to deplete further before ordering, especially since the holding cost ($1.0) is significant relative to the unit profit ($4.0). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the emerging upward trend while maintaining the default lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Early fall seasonal recovery detected starting P24 (July 22): Demand increased from summer trough (avg <3 units) to 12 (P24) and 20 (P25) units as 'Back to School' season begins.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Queen Sweater' is currently entering the 'Back to School' and early fall seasonal recovery phase. After a summer trough where demand averaged <3 units, we have seen a consistent increase over the last three periods: P24 (12 units), P25 (20 units), and P26 (22 units). This confirms the demand regime shift previously identified. The current date is August 12, which aligns with typical late-summer/early-fall retail scaling for lightweight sweatshirts. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods. With on-hand inventory at 31 units and demand trending upwards (avg of last 3 periods is 18 units), I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this upward momentum while ensuring the service level accounts for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio. Setting N to 3 specifically focuses on the recovery trend rather than the summer lows.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal recovery confirmed: Demand increased for three consecutive periods (12, 20, 22 units) starting P24 (July 22), signaling the end of the summer trough.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is showing a strong seasonal recovery as it transitions into late summer/early fall (Back to School). Demand has increased for four consecutive periods: 12 (P24), 20 (P25), 22 (P26), and 36 (P27). The most recent period (P27) resulted in a stockout (demand 36 vs 31 available on-hand), confirming that previous surplus inventory is depleted and proactive replenishment is required. The current date (August 19) typically aligns with peak 'Back to School' shopping and early pre-fall interest. I am setting the demand regime (N) to 4 to capture this specific upward trend (averaging 22.5 units/period) rather than larger historical averages or the summer trough. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal recovery is accelerating: demand has increased from a summer baseline of <5 units to 36 units over the last 4 periods (P24-P27), leading to an inventory stockout in P27.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late-August fall transition. Demand has consistently recovered from the summer trough (<5 units) to an average of 23.4 units over the last 5 periods (P24-P28: 12, 20, 22, 36, 27). The peak of 36 units in P27 and the slight dip to 27 in P28 suggest we are moving toward a stable early-fall baseline higher than summer but lower than the spring/clearance peaks. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory is low (4 units on-hand), and since the lead time is 0, we must order for the current period's demand. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 (covering the start of the fall recovery in late July) to capture the current upward trend while being mindful of the slight moderation observed in the most recent period.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal recovery stabilized (P24-P28): Demand has averaged 23.4 units since late July, confirming a shift from the summer trough (<5 units) to an early-fall regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is showing a strong seasonal recovery as it transitions into September. Current demand in Period 29 reached 40 units, continuing the upward trend from the late-July 'Back to School' start. The fall regime (P24-P29) now shows an average demand of 26.2 units, significantly higher than the summer trough. The last three periods (P27-P29) show an average of 34.3 units, indicating acceleration as autumn approaches. However, the system is presently stocking out (on-hand is 0, sold 31 of 40 units in P29), meaning the mu_hat needs to be set aggressively to capture this growth. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the entire fall recovery period (avg ~26) but use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the most recent demand spike (40) and the trend of increasing sales as temperatures drop. I will set mu_hat to 45 to ensure sufficient stock for the next period, and sigma_hat to explicit 15 to account for the volatility seen in recent weeks (27, 40). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal recovery is accelerating: demand increased from P27 (36), P28 (27), to P29 (40). Current fall regime (P24-P29) mean is 26.2 units and rising.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Queen Sweater has entered a severe upward trajectory as we enter September (P31, 2019-09-09). Period 30 saw a massive spike to 172 units, which is a 330% increase from the previous week's 40 units and significantly higher than the 126.7 avg seen during the May clearance. This indicates the start of the primary fall/winter peak for sweaters. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I must set the base stock high enough to capture this accelerating demand while managing the 0 on-hand inventory. The current regime (P24-P30) has a mean of 47.0, but the last two periods (40, 172) show exponential growth. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this acceleration (avg = 79.67) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which allows the OR backend to scale the order significantly based on the recent variance and mean shift.

Carry-over insight: Major fall seasonal surge confirmed P30: Demand spiked from 40 to 172 units (+330%), indicating the start of the peak sweater season, far exceeding the late-July recovery baseline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 677930023 has entered a full seasonal peak for the fall/autumn season. Demand in P30 and P31 was 172 and 186 units respectively, causing stockouts despite aggressive ordering. This represents a confirmed regime shift from the early-fall recovery (avg ~26) to a high-demand peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this surge and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat to be explicit, slightly exceeding the most recent demand to account for potential lost demand during the stockout (observed 186, sold 148). Sigma_hat is set to a recent window of 3 to capture the high volatility of this peak phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak demand regime confirmed P30-P31: Demand increased from ~40 to nearly 190 units (172, 186), representing the primary fall seasonal peak for the sweater category. Orders must scale to ~190-200 units to avoid stockouts.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is currently in its primary fall seasonal peak. Demand has increased rapidly over the last three periods: P30 (172 units), P31 (186 units), and P32 (234 units). This clearly marks a sustained high-demand regime as autumn begins in late September. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. To maintain sufficient stock levels while accounting for the high volatility and upward trend of this seasonal peak, I will use the recent_N method based on the last 3 periods (P30-P32) where demand underwent this massive shift. The average demand during this 3-period peak is 197.3 units. Setting \u03bc\u0302 to reflect this recent peak average and using a recent_N sigma calculation (31.3 units) will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the current peak demand while balancing the risk of stockouts during this high-profit seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak demand regime (P30-P32) confirmed: demand has scaled from ~40 to an average of 197.3 units (most recent 234) as fall sweater season matures.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 677930023 is in a hyper-growth phase as we enter peak fall sweater season (late September). Period 33 demand reached 352 units, a 50% increase over Period 32 (234 units) and far exceeding the previous high of 186. The Carry-over Insight from Period 33 (average ~197) is now obsolete as demand has accelerated significantly. The last three periods (P31-P33) show demand of 186, 234, and 352. To capture this trend and avoid the recurrent stockouts (on-hand is 0), I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method. I'll forecast demand for Period 34 at ~400 units, reflecting the current momentum of ~50% weekly growth and the high service level required (Profit $4 vs Holding $1). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the high volatility in this peak regime.

Carry-over insight: Peak fall demand acceleration confirmed (P31-P33): Demand has grown from 186 to 352 units (+89% in two weeks), reflecting the core seasonal peak for sweaters. Average demand for the last 3 weeks is 257.3 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Queen Sweater is in its peak fall seasonal regime. Although demand dipped from P33 (352) to P34 (222), the 222 units still represent a very high level of demand compared to the early-fall recovery and late-summer trough. The current on-hand inventory of 250 units covers the P34 demand but does not provide a sufficient safety buffer if demand rebounds toward the P33 peak (~350 units). Based on my analysis, the peak demand regime P31-P34 has an average of 248.5 units. Given that lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (P31-P34) to capture this high-volume period. This will signal the OR backend to maintain inventory levels around 250-300 units, balancing the high service level required for the peak season against the $1.00 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Peak fall demand regime stabilized (P31-P34): Demand average is 248.5 units, significantly higher than the early fall recovery baseline of 26.2 units. Monitoring for seasonal peak plateau or post-October decline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is currently in its peak fall/winter demand season. After a significant peak in late September (P33 demand: 352), demand has begun to moderate as it moves into October (P34: 222, P35: 167). The current average demand for the last five periods (P31-P35) is 232.2 units, but the most recent two periods show a clear deceleration from the peak. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the core peak period) provides a balanced forecast of 232.2 units per period. This captures the high seasonal baseline while acknowledging the recent slowdown to avoid excessive holding costs on a declining trend. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to reflect the high volatility (std dev ~71) observed during this peak-and-plateau phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' ordering to manage the high volume safely.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand deceleration detected: Following the seasonal peak in Period 33 (352 units), demand has decreased for two consecutive weeks to 167 units in Period 35 (-52% from peak). Monitoring to see if demand stabilizes at a new late-fall plateau (~150-200 units).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (Period 37), moving past the peak fall seasonal surge observed in September/early October. Demand has decelerated from a peak of 352 (P33) to 222 (P34), 167 (P35), and most recently 132 (P36). This confirms a post-peak plateau or deceleration into the late fall regime. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P34-P36) is 173.7, while the most recent 2 periods average 149.5. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), it is prudent to adjust mu_hat downwards to reflect this cooling demand while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the residual fall volume (~130-150 units). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this deceleration. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal deceleration confirmed (P34-P36): Demand has declined for three consecutive periods from a peak of 352 to 132. The average demand for the most recent 2 periods (P35-P36) is 149.5 units, down significantly from the peak average.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 677930023 (Queen Sweater) is continuing its post-peak seasonal deceleration as expected for late October. Demand has declined from a peak of 352 (P33) to 222, 167, 132, and now 120 units in Period 37. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P35-P37) is 139.7 units, showing a stabilization pattern below the mid-September peak but significantly above the early fall recovery baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and an on-hand inventory of 92 units, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to reflect this new late-fall plateau (~140 units per period). This approach ensures we maintain enough stock for the current demand level without over-ordering during a declining seasonal phase.

Carry-over insight: Late-fall demand plateau confirmed (P35-P37): Demand has stabilized at an average of 139.7 units following the mid-September seasonal peak, down from the P31-P34 average of ~248 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Queen Sweater is currently in a late-fall plateau following the mid-September peak. Demand in Period 38 (165 units) was higher than the previous three weeks' average (avg ~140), leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). The most recent four periods (P35-P38) show a mean demand of 146 units. Since we are entering November, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly increase as winter weather sets in, before any end-of-year clearance. We need to replenish stock immediately to cover the current period's demand. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat [146 * (1+0) = 146] and sigma_hat to reflect the current post-peak variability while keeping L at the promised 0 periods, which has been consistently reliable.

Carry-over insight: Late-fall demand plateau (P35-P38) has stabilized with a mean of 146 units, following the 250+ unit peak in September. Period 38 saw a rebound to 165 units from a low of 120 (P37).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Queen Sweater (SKU 677930023) has experienced a significant decline in Period 39 to 50 units, following a stable plateau of approximately 146 units between Periods 35-38. This sharp drop likely signals the end of the late-fall seasonal peak as we enter mid-November. The current on-hand inventory is 116 units, which is already more than double the most recent demand. To prevent excessive holding costs during this apparent seasonal wind-down, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent_N method with N=3 to incorporate the recent 165-unit and 50-unit observations, while moving away from the high-demand September/October peaks. This balances the risk of a potential bounce-back with the clear downward trend seen in the most recent data point. Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Post-plateau demand decline detected: Period 39 demand dropped to 50 units (-66% vs P38), signaling the likely end of the late-fall sweater season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Queen Sweater is entering late fall/early winter (November 18). After a high peak in September (up to 352 units) and a subsequent plateau around 150 units, demand has now dropped significantly for two consecutive weeks, with Period 39 and 40 both recording demand around 50 units (50 and 51 units respectively). This signals a transition from the late-fall plateau to a lower, stable winter demand level. On-hand inventory is currently at 110 units, which more than covers two periods of this new 50-unit demand level. To prevent excessive holding costs during this declining phase, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the most recent two-week average. Since the transition is sharp, using 'recent_N' with N=2 provides the most responsive estimate to current demand while the inventory surplus is cleared. Lead time remains consistently at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: Demand has significantly decelerated from the 150-unit plateau to a new baseline of ~50 units (P39: 50, P40: 51) as the peak sweater season concludes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 677930023 hasn't changed significantly since the shift observed at Period 40. Demand for the last three periods has been remarkably consistent: P39=50, P40=51, P41=47 (mean = 49.3). This confirms a stable late-fall/early-winter regime following the September/October peaks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 63 and a current demand baseline of approximately 50 units, the system is slightly overstocked, but no order is likely to be triggered by the base stock logic if parameters are set to match this new regime. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'post-peak' demand level precisely without being skewed by the much higher September/October data.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime stabilized (P39-P41): Demand has averaged 49.3 units, confirming a significant drop from the plateau of ~140-150 units seen in late October.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Queen Sweater is showing signs of a small late-season rebound after the initial post-peak decline. Period 42 saw demand rise to 74 units, up from the stable ~50 unit baseline seen in P39-P41. This coincides with late November/early December (pre-holiday period), where a minor secondary peak is common before the final winter clearance. With current on-hand inventory at 0, a stockout occurred in Period 42. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this slightly higher recent demand to capture the holiday uptick. I'll use recent_N with N=4 to weigh the recent shift (avg P39-P42 = 55.5 units) while maintaining sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in the last week (74 vs 47). L remains 0 as confirmed by 42 periods of history.

Carry-over insight: Late-November demand rebound: Demand increased from a ~50 unit baseline (P39-P41) to 74 units in P42 (Date: Dec 2), signaling a minor pre-holiday uptick for sweaters.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019 (Period 44). We are observing the late-season behavior for this lightweight sweatshirt SKU. After a minor late-November uptick (74 units in P42), demand sharply regressed to 29 units in P43. Historically, this product exhibits high volatility around seasonal transitions. The late-fall plateau (P35-P38) averaged 146 units, followed by a post-peak drop to ~50 units (P39-P41), a brief spike to 74 (P42), and now 29 (P43). Given the proximity to the end of the year and the recent drop, I expect demand to stabilize at a lower winter level. I will use a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the post-November behavior (avg ~50 units) while smoothing the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the variance between the 74-unit spike and the 29-unit drop. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regression: Demand dropped from 74 units (P42) to 29 units (P43), suggesting the brief late-November rally has ended and demand is returning to a lower winter baseline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 677930023, a lightweight sweater, is currently in a late-winter/post-holiday demand phase. Following a brief rally in late November (P42: 74 units), demand has regressed to a moderate baseline (P43: 29; P44: 49). The average demand over the last two periods (P43-P44) is 39 units. Given the seasonal context (mid-December), we expect low but steady demand before the end-of-year clearing or spring transition. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 2 periods to capture this stabilized post-rally demand and use a recent window for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility. With on-hand inventory at 15 and no in-transit units, an order is needed to meet the expected 39-unit demand and maintain a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday winter baseline confirmed (P43-P44): Demand has stabilized at an average of 39 units following the late-November peak, down from the peak season plateau.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. We are in the post-holiday winter baseline for sweaters. Historical data and the last three periods (P43-P45) show a stabilized demand average of 38.3 units (29, 49, 37). While Christmas/Boxing Day occurs this week, the long-term trend for this lightweight sweatshirt/sweater SKU suggests a steady, lower-volume baseline rather than a major surge like the one seen in September. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P43-P45) to capture this winter baseline. On-hand inventory is 16 units, and the OR backend will calculate the necessary order based on the base stock derived from these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Queen Sweater has stabilized into a late-year winter baseline. Following the peak season and a brief late-November rally, demand over the last four periods (P43-P46) has been remarkably consistent: 29, 49, 37, and 35 units, with a mean of 37.5. The most recent three samples (P44-P46) average 40.3 units. Given the transition into late December and early January, I expect demand to remain at this baseline or slightly lower as the secondary winter peak (pre-holiday) ends. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this stable late-winter regime (mean ~38, std ~8). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 12, so the OR backend will calculate a base stock around ~50-60 based on these stats and order the difference.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday winter baseline stabilized (P43-P46): Demand has averaged 37.5 units, following the late-fall peak and brief Dec 2 rally. This represents the current seasonal demand for the sweater category entering 2020.
