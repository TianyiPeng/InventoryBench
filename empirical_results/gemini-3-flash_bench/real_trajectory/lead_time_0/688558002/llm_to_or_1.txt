Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 688558002 is a 'Brittany LS' fitted, long-sleeved jersey top. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from Jan 7th (6 units) to Feb 4th (90 units). This suggests a seasonal buildup, likely for the transition into spring. Given the promised lead time (L) is 0, the total demand to cover is (1 + 0) = 1 period. To avoid stockouts during this accelerating demand phase, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the most recent demand (90 units) plus a small growth buffer, forecasting 100 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the recent high volatility during the spike. L is set to 'default' (0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 67 units, which follows a strong upward trend identified in the pre-game history (6, 11, 48, 72, 90). The product 'Brittany LS' (fitted, long-sleeved top) is likely experiencing peak seasonal demand for late winter/early spring. The actual lead time was observed as 0 periods in Period 1, confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Given the sharp increase in demand over the last few weeks (moving from ~48 to ~90 and then recording 67 in P1), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime. This provides a balance between the late-Jan peak and the P1 observation. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen during this growth phase. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the 0-period lead time plus the upcoming period's demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (Fitted long-sleeved jersey top) is showing a strong upward demand trend. Historical samples (Jan) grew from 6 to 90. Period 1 demand was 67, and Period 2 jumped to 128, resulting in a stockout (sold 97, demand 128). This suggests the product is entering a peak seasonal phase. Since the promised lead time is 0 and we observed lead_time=0 in both Period 1 and Period 2, L is set to 'default'. To address the increasing demand and recover from the stockout, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth (averages of 90, 67, and 128). I'm setting sigma_hat to 'explicit' at 40 to provide a buffer against the high volatility seen in the last period's jump (from 67 to 128).

Carry-over insight: Demand is in a significant growth phase: increased from 67 (P1) to 128 (P2), a 91% week-over-week jump, leading to a stockout.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688558002' (long-sleeved jersey top) is experiencing a high-demand regime, likely due to spring seasonality transition in late February/early March. Demand jumped from 67 (P1) to an average of 125.5 (\xb13.5) over the last two periods (P2: 128, P3: 123). The stockout in P2 was resolved by a large order in P3, but the ending inventory of 38 units is low relative to the current demand level. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). To maintain high service levels (critical given the $19.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio) and account for the upward trend from the initial samples (range 6-90 in Jan/Feb), I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the current high-demand phase (avg ~106 per period including initial growth). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the current demand level plus a safety buffer for the ongoing seasonality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: avg demand increased from ~61 (historical + P1) to ~125 (P2-P3) as seasonality shifts into spring.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved 'Brittany LS' top, which is entering a seasonal transition period. Demand history shows a peak in February (P2: 128, P3: 123) followed by a significant drop in Period 4 (75). The initial samples provided (90 on 2019-02-04) also support a mid-winter peak. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently healthy at 87 units. Since demand appears to be cooling off from the February peak but remains higher than the very early January baselines, I will use a recent window (N=3) to capture the current post-peak stabilization level (avg ~108). This prevents over-ordering based on the temporary spike while remaining responsive to the current spring demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand peaked in late February (avg ~125) and has begun a downward shift in March (P4 demand 75), indicating a post-peak stabilization or seasonal decline for long-sleeved items.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688558002' (long-sleeved top) has transitioned from a high-demand peak in February (~125 units/week) to a stabilized lower demand regime in March. For the last two periods (P4 and P5), demand has been consistently 75 and 74 units respectively. Given the date is March 18th and the product is a long-sleeved jersey top, we are moving further away from its peak seasonality. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining service levels for this stable regime, I will use recent_N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level (~74.5) specifically. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the lower, stable March demand rather than the high February peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in March: Periods 4 and 5 show consistent demand of 74-75 units, a ~40% decrease from the February peak (~125 units).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved top) is currently in a post-peak stabilization phase following a February surge. Demand for the last three periods (P4-P6) has been 75, 74, and 82 respectively, establishing a stable mean of approximately 77 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is critically low (1 unit) with 0 units in-transit. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held (all prior orders arrived in the same period they were placed), I will maintain L=0. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized demand level while ignoring the earlier February peak. For volatility, I will also use N=3 to reflect the current low-variance regime (Std \u2248 4.3). This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand (~77 units) with a buffer, resulting in an order of approximately 76-80 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brittany LS' (long-sleeved top) has entered a stable post-peak demand phase following the February-March transition. Historical data and recent periods (P4-P7) show demand has stabilized around a mean of 76.5 units (P4: 75, P5: 74, P6: 82, P7: 75), significantly lower than the February peak of ~125. April (Period 8) is typically consistent with late March demand for this category before further seasonal shifts. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 7 periods. I am setting L to default (0) and mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new stable regime of ~76.5 units per period. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the low volatility observed during this stabilization phase. Current on-hand is low (10 units), necessitating a standard order via the OR backend to return to base stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1577.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 4-8) shows a stabilization around a mean of 79.6 units (75, 74, 82, 75, 92), following a February peak. The stockout in Period 8 (92 demand vs 83 available) suggests a slight upward variance in early April, possibly due to spring shopping. Total demand has consistently outperformed the initial historical mean of 45.4 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized spring regime (avg ~80) and sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last period. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Setting N=5 focuses on the most relevant demand behavior since the post-February drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in early spring (P4-P8) at an average of ~80 units per period, a ~15% increase from the March baseline, likely due to seasonal shifts.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is April 15, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top. Reviewing recent demand, we see a significant drop in Period 9 (39 units) compared to the stable Period 4-8 average of ~80 units. This is likely a seasonal transition; as spring progresses into mid-April, demand for long-sleeved fitted tops typically declines in favor of short-sleeved or lighter alternatives. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (P1-P9) consistently show an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently at 54 units with 0 in-transit. Given the sharp drop in P9, I will move from a broad history average to a more responsive forecast. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent stable period and the start of the decline, which results in a mu_hat of approx 70 units ((75+92+39+67)/4 rounded, then adjusted for L+1). This balances the risk of further decline with the possibility that P9 was an outlier.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal decline confirmed: Period 9 demand (39) is 50% below the previous 5-period average (~80), signaling reduced interest in long-sleeved jersey tops during mid-April.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) is showing a clear seasonal decline as we enter late April (2019/4/22). Demand has dropped from an average of ~80 units (P4-P8) to 39 units (P9) and now 31 units (P10). This represents a consistent downward trend as warmer weather reduces demand for long-sleeved items. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. With 79 units on-hand and current demand levels trending towards 30 units or lower, we are currently holding approximately 2.6 periods of stock. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level for the remaining seasonal demand, I am using a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to capture this lower regime (P8-P10 avg = 54, but the most recent two are 35.5). By setting N=3, the mu_hat will reflect the transition and prevent over-ordering as demand fades.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Late April demand (P9, P10) averaged 35 units, a >50% decline from the early spring average of ~80 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved ribbed jersey top, which is transitioning out of peak season as weather warms. Historically, demand peaked in February/March (~125 units) and has significantly cooled. The most recent demand regime (Periods 9-11) shows an average of 39.3 units (39, 31, 48), supporting the carry-over insight of a >50% decline from the early spring average of ~80. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a declining seasonal item, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to focus on this lower demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current reduced volatility. The OR backend will use these to maintain a lean inventory appropriate for the low-season volume.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is entering its seasonal off-peak as temperatures rise in late spring/early summer. Demand has significantly decelerated from the February peak (~125) and March/early April plateau (~80). Over the last 4 periods (P9-P12), demand has averaged 40.25 units (39, 31, 48, 43). Recent volatility (std dev) for these 4 periods is approximately 7.2 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With 18 units on hand and a demand forecast of approximately 40 units per period, the current inventory is insufficient. I will use a restricted window (recent_N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower stabilization point and avoid over-ordering based on earlier high-demand periods, while still providing enough stock to meet the current trailing average.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688558002' (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) has entered a clear seasonal decline as we move into mid-May. After a peak in February/March (avg ~80-120 units), demand in the most recent 5 periods (P9-P13) has dropped significantly to an average of 37.8 units (39, 31, 48, 43, 28). The most recent observation (P13 demand = 28) confirms this downward trend as warmer weather reduces interest in long-sleeved items. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (Holding Cost = $1 vs Profit = $19, requiring a ~95% service level which the OR backend will calculate), I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the last 5 periods (P9-P13) to capture this lower demand regime. Using N=5 provides a stable yet reactive average for this shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease sustained: Early to mid-May demand (P9-P13) averaged ~38 units, down from the ~80 unit average in April.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top (Brittany LS), which is experiencing a sustained low-demand phase as the weather warms up in mid-May. Weekly demand since early April (Period 9) has averaged approximately 37 units (39, 31, 48, 43, 28, 32). The most recent regime (P9-P14) is stable at this lower level. The observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a declining seasonal item, I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current late-spring demand regime (~37 units/period). This provides a tighter inventory target than the overall historical average, which is still inflated by the February peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is entering a low-demand phase as late spring transitions into summer. Historical demand samples from January/February (noted as 6, 11, 48, 72, 90) combined with recent game history show a clear bell-curve seasonality: starting low in winter, peaking in late February/early March (up to 128 units), and declining steadily through April and May. The most recent demand (P15) was 26 units, confirming a sustained lower regime. The average demand over the last five periods (P11-P15) is 35.4 units, which is consistent with the 'Period 14' carry-over insight of ~38 units. Since demand is currently stable at this lower level, I will use a recent_N window of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-spring baseline. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) is in a seasonal decline phase as it moves into the summer months (early June). Demand over the last 4 periods (P13-P16) has been consistently low and stable, averaging 27.75 units per period (28, 32, 26, 25). The broader trend since late April (P9-P16) shows an average demand of approximately 34 units. However, the most recent 4-week window represents the most accurate 'regime' for current summer low-season forecasting. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. Mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the current stable low-demand regime (~28 units/period). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in this phase, allowing the OR backend to maintain efficient inventory levels without excessive holding costs for a declining seasonal item.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a summer low: Period 13-16 demand averaged 28 units, reflecting a further 26% decrease from the late April/early May average (~38 units).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (fitted long-sleeved top) is currently in a stable low-demand regime typical for the summer months. Recent demand from Period 13 to Period 17 has been consistently low, averaging approximately 28.2 units per period (28, 32, 26, 25, 30). The current date is June 10th, and there is no evidence of a seasonal rebound yet. On-hand inventory is very low (3 units), requiring a replenishment order to meet expected demand. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable summer baseline and ensure sufficient stock for the upcoming period while minimizing holding costs.

Demand has historically dropped from a peak of ~125 in February to a stable low average of approximately 27-28 units over the last 5-6 weeks (P13-P18: 28, 32, 26, 25, 30, 24). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the current inventory of 9 units and meet the expected low summer demand while minimizing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this stabilized summer regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is naturally counter-seasonal for the peak summer months. Demand has shown a clear downward trajectory from its February peak (~125) and subsequent spring baseline (~80). In the most recent four periods (P16-P19), demand has fallen further, averaging approximately 23.5 units (25, 30, 24, 15). The most recent demand of 15 units is the lowest recorded in the game history, suggesting a significant seasonal dip as temperatures rise. To avoid excess holding costs on a low-demand item, I am focusing on the most recent 4 periods to capture this 'summer low' regime. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated based on this recent 4-week window (N=4) to reflect the lower expected demand (avg ~24) and recent volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a leaner base stock suitable for the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor confirmed: Late June demand (P19=15) shows a continued decline from the late May/early June average (~27), signaling a seasonal minimum for long-sleeved items.

The product is a long-sleeved ribbed jersey top, which is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as we enter July. Demand has steadily dropped from a February peak of ~125 units to a recent low of 12-15 units. Periods 19 and 20 recorded demands of 15 and 12 respectively. I am setting the lead time L to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent 0-period actual lead time observed throughout the history. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent summer floor demand (average ~13.6 units), which prevents overstocking during this low-demand phase. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current low volatility in demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is currently in its seasonal low during July. Analysis of recent demand (Period 19-21) shows a stabilized low-demand regime averaging approx 15 units per period (15, 12, 17). This follows a sustained downward trend from the spring peak (~80) and early summer average (~27). Historically, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' ordering. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19), the service level (q) remains high (~95%), but we must avoid overstocking as the summer minimum is confirmed. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=4 to capture this current mid-summer floor while providing enough signal for the high service level required.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for this long-sleeved jersey top (688558002) has been in a sustained seasonal low throughout June and early July. However, Period 22 observed a sudden demand spike to 32 units, an 88% increase from the previous four-week average (~17 units), leading to a stockout. This may indicate an early start to 'Back to School' interest or a mid-summer clearance-driven peak. Given that lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, I will react to this shift by using recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent volume increase while maintaining protection against volatility. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent trend (~20-25 units/period) rather than the long-term summer floor.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand spike detected in early July (P22=32) compared to the late June average (~15), suggesting a potential break in the summer demand floor.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (fitted long-sleeved top) is currently in a low-demand summer phase, though we observed a mid-July spike. Period 22 demand was 32, followed by Period 23 demand of 20. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) is 18.2 units. Given it is late July (2019/7/22), we expect demand to remain low for a long-sleeved item, but we must account for the slight volatility seen in the last two weeks as customers might start looking toward late-summer or early-autumn wardrobes. Promised lead time is 0 and has consistently been 0. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (approx 20.25 units) to capture the recent slight increase from the mid-June floor while acknowledging the 20-unit demand from last week. sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=5 to capture that volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand regime appears to be stabilizing slightly higher than the June floor (P19-P20 avg 13.5), with P21-P23 averaging 23 units, suggesting a potential early transition toward late summer demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) is exiting its summer demand floor. Following a confirmed minimum in late June (P19-P20 average of ~13.5), demand has stabilized at a slightly higher level in July (P21-P24 average of 21.5 units). This suggest the start of a gradual transition toward late summer/early autumn demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this emerging stabilization and slight upward trend without overreacting to individual spikes (like P22's 32), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4, covering the entire month of July. This targets a demand forecast of ~22 units per period (1+L multiplier), which balances the increased service level needs for a higher-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) against the risk of early-season overstocking.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-05. The SKU is a long-sleeved ribbed jersey top. Historically (from the provided 2019-01 data), demand was rising significantly in January and February (averaging ~100 units). The summer (June-July) saw a floor with demand often below 20 units, but we are now entering August. August typically marks the beginning of the 'Back to School' and pre-fall season for apparel, where long-sleeved basics begin to trend upward again. Period 25 demand was low (11), but looking at the transition from P21-P25, demand is averaging roughly 18 units, which is higher than the June floor of ~13. Given the Lead Time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this slightly elevated late-summer baseline using the last 5 periods (N=5), which captures the slight lift from the mid-summer lows while remaining cautious about the major autumn ramp-up which likely occurs later in August.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical data and product description (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) suggest we are entering the pre-autumn phase where demand for long-sleeved items typically begins to recover from summer lows. Early August demand (P26=27) shows a sharp increase from the late July average (P24-P25 avg = 14), echoing a similar trend seen in early July (P22=32). While demand remains volatile, the 'summer floor' observed in June/July (avg ~15-20) is being tested. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this potential seasonal pivot without over-reacting to a single high data point, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand (covering the last 5 weeks of mid-summer to early August) to set a baseline that acknowledges the recent increase (avg P22-P26 = 21.4) while maintaining enough stock to prevent another stockout like Period 22.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Early August demand (P26=27) shows a recovery from the late July floor (~14 units), indicating the start of a seasonal transition back toward autumn demand levels for long-sleeved tops.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Brittany LS' (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) has entered a significant autumn recovery phase. In Period 27 (mid-August), demand jumped to 56 units, more than double the average of the preceding four periods (~18.75 units). This confirms the seasonal transition anticipated in previous periods as customers begin shopping for late-summer/early-autumn apparel. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout last period. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 0. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast of 60 based on the recent surge (56), anticipating continued growth as we approach September. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with this demand shift while providing a buffer against further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal recovery confirmed: Demand in mid-August (P27=56) more than doubled the previous 4-period average (~19), signaling the end of the summer low for long-sleeved items.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) is entering its autumn recovery phase as of late August. Historical data shows demand surged from a summer floor of ~15 units to 56 units in Period 27 and remained high at 52 units in Period 28. This confirms a sustained regime shift as consumers prepare for cooler weather. Currently, on-hand inventory is 37 units with no units in transit. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle the increased demand while accounting for potential volatility during this transition, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand weeks (averaging ~45 units including the stockout period). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current higher volatility during this seasonal pivot, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level that avoids further stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand shift confirmed: Mid-to-late August demand (P27-P28) averaged 54 units, a 285% increase over the late July/early August average (~14 units), indicating a robust seasonal return for long-sleeved items.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a fitted, long-sleeved jersey top, which is highly sensitive to seasonal transitions. We are currently in Period 30 (Sept 2), moving into the peak autumn season. While demand in P29 dipped to 32 units, the preceding two weeks (P27-P28) averaged 54 units, marking a clear departure from the summer floor (avg ~14). Historically (Jan-Feb), demand for this item ranged from 72 to 128 units. We are at the start of the 'Back to School' and autumn fashion ramp-up. The P29 dip is likely a minor fluctuation before a larger seasonal ascent. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the expectation of continued autumn growth (approx 65 units for the next period) to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 2 and 8 during previous transitions. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand ramp-up in progress: mid-to-late August demand (P27-P29) averaged 47 units, a >230% increase over the summer floor (~14 units), aligning with seasonal expectations for long-sleeved items.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) is deep into its autumn seasonal recovery. Demand in Period 30 spiked to 80 units, significantly higher than the late August average (P27-P29 avg ~47) and far above the summer floor (~14). This aligns with the transition into September (Date: 2019/9/9), where cooler weather typically drives demand for long-sleeved basics. To capture this acceleration and avoid stockouts (on-hand is low at 16), I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=4 to weigh the recent autumn ramp-up (P27-P30: 56, 52, 32, 80) more heavily than the summer data. While we expect the upward trend to continue, the OR backend's inventory balancing (calculated using a high service level since profit/holding ratio is 19:1) will naturally buffer against further spikes. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so L is set to 'default'.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand acceleration confirmed: Period 30 demand (80) represents a 70% increase over the mid-August average (~47), confirming a significant seasonal ramp-up as the calendar moves into September.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) has entered a major autumn demand acceleration phase. Period 31 demand reached 152 units, nearly double the previous period's 80 units and significantly higher than the mid-August average (~50). This aligns with seasonal transitions into cooler weather in mid-September. We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand), and the actual lead time is consistently 0. Given the sharp upward trend, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat to capture the current demand level + a growth buffer to prevent further stockouts. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent demand (152) plus a modest increase to account for the ongoing momentum into peak fall season. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the high volatility observed during this ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge peak: Period 31 demand (152) represents a ~90% increase over Period 30 (80) and a >200% increase over the August average (~50), confirming a rapid seasonal acceleration for long-sleeved items.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (fitted long-sleeved jersey top) is in the midst of a significant autumn demand surge. Demand in Period 31 and 32 stabilized at a high of ~152-153 units, which is roughly double the demand seen in early September and over 10x the summer floor. As we are now in late September (2019/9/23), demand for long-sleeved items is expected to remain high or continue to climb slightly as temperatures drop. However, the plateau at ~153 units over the last two periods suggests the current growth rate has moderated. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 30-32 avg: 128 units), which provides a conservative but responsive baseline for (1+L) periods. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. Lead time remains stable at 0. On-hand inventory is 112, and the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to meet the specified base stock level based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand plateau: Demand has stabilized at a high level (~153 units) during mid-to-late September (P31-P32), confirming a sustained seasonal peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (late September), we experienced a massive demand spike to 522 units, which is a significant outlier compared to the previous two periods of relative stability around 153 units (~240% increase). This likely reflects a major late-September/early-October seasonal event or a high-velocity stockout correction from a competitor. On-hand inventory is currently 0. To capture this new, heightened demand level and prevent further lost sales, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to an explicit forecast. While the previous mean (P31-P32) was ~153, the jump to 522 suggests a new peak. I will set mu_hat to 350 (a conservative but responsive middle ground between the plateau and the spike) to avoid excessive holding costs if P33 was a non-repeating anomaly, while still providing significant coverage. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to 150 to account for the extreme volatility observed (153 to 522). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Extreme demand surge detected in late September (P33=522), a 240% increase over the mid-September plateau (~153), signaling a hyper-peak or specific seasonal event.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the long-sleeved jersey top has been highly volatile in recent periods. Period 33 experienced a massive spike (522 units), which appears to be a hyper-peak or specific event, as demand in Period 34 retreated to 192 units. Despite the retreat, 192 units still represents a significant volume compared to the early September average (~80-150 units). We are currently in early October, which is a prime season for long-sleeved items. Given the recent variability (522 followed by 192), a simple average would be skewed high by the jump in P33. I will utilize the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the current autumn demand regime (spanning P31 to P34: 152, 153, 522, 192), which averages 254.75 units. This ensures we maintain a sufficient base stock for the seasonal peak while respecting the lower (but still high) demand level observed in the most recent period. Current on-hand inventory is 405 units, which provides a comfortable buffer against the projected average, but the OR backend will calculate additional safety stock based on the high standard deviation of this 4-period window to mitigate the risk of another stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand volatility detected in late September/early October. Following the extreme spike of 522 units (P33), Period 34 demand normalized to 192 units, which remains significantly higher than early September levels (~150).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 is a fitted, long-sleeved top, which is highly seasonal. We are currently in mid-October (Period 36). After a massive volatility event in late September (P33 demand of 522), demand has stabilized at a lower but still significant level (P34 = 192, P35 = 130). The historical samples from January/February 2019 (6 to 90 units) suggest that demand typically ramps up towards late winter but is lower than the current autumn peak. We are currently overstocked with 420 units on-hand, which covers roughly three weeks of the current demand level (~140/week). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P33-P35) which include the peak and the subsequent normalization, average ~280 units. However, given the clear downward trend from the hyper-peak (522 -> 192 -> 130), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent volatility while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock. The on-hand inventory is high, so the OR engine will likely place a small or zero order this period.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization: Demand has decreased for two consecutive periods following the P33 hyper-peak (522 to 192 to 130), settling into a mid-autumn regime that remains higher than early September levels (~80).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the long-sleeved jersey top (SKU 688558002) is currently in a post-peak stabilization phase as the calendar moves deeper into October. After the hyper-peak in Period 33 (522 units) and subsequent periods (192, 130), the most recent demand (Period 36) was 105 units. This confirms a downward trend from the autumn peak but maintains a higher baseline than early September levels. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 523 units with no units in transit. Given the recent demand average (last 3 periods: ~142 units; last period: 105 units), the current stock is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods of demand at the current stabilized rate. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this high-profit item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent stabilized demand regime (last 4 periods, which includes the descent from the hyper-peak) to ensure the base stock calculation aligns with the current trend. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn stabilization: Demand has declined for three consecutive periods following the late September hyper-peak (522 -> 192 -> 130 -> 105), settling into a regime averaging ~140 units over the last 4 weeks.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'Brittany LS' (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) has entered a post-hyper-peak stabilization phase following the extreme surge in late September (P33). Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has recorded 192, 130, 105, and 123 units, averaging 137.5 units. This indicates a relatively stable mid-autumn demand regime, significantly lower than the P33 spike (522) but higher than the early September ramp-up. We currently have 433 units on hand, which is approximately 3.1 weeks of supply based on the current average. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid further inflating inventory while maintaining a safe service level for this seasonally relevant item, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this stable post-peak regime and sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect current volatility. No new order is likely to be triggered given the high current inventory relative to the base stock calculation, which is appropriate for managing holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688558002 (fitted long-sleeved jersey top) is in its peak autumn/winter season. Demand peaked extremely high in late September (P33=522) and has since stabilized in a high-demand regime. The last four periods (P35-P38) show demand of 130, 105, 123, and 156 respectively, averaging 128.5 units. The most recent demand (P38 = 156) indicates a potential late-autumn uptick or volatility as we enter November. Current on-hand inventory is 277 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this stabilized high-demand regime using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current mean of ~129 units. Sigma_hat is also set using N=4 to account for the recent variance in this high-demand period, ensuring a high service level while managing holding costs for the 277 units currently on hand.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Late autumn demand stabilized. After the hyper-peak in P33, demand for P35-P38 has averaged 129 units, reflecting a high-volume seasonal regime for long-sleeved tops.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the mid-to-late autumn season for this long-sleeved jersey top. Recent demand (P34-P39) has shown higher volatility following the late September hyper-peak, settling into a regime that averaged ~131 units (P35-P39) before a sharp drop to 79 units in P39. While the long-term trend for P35-P39 is 130, 105, 123, 156, and 79, the average is 118.6 units. Given the seasonality, a slight downward trend is expected as we approach winter, but we must maintain sufficient stock to cover the typical 100-150 unit weekly range observed in autumn. The current on-hand inventory is 198 units, which covers nearly two weeks of recent average demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use categorical recent_N settings to allow the OR engine to adapt to the post-peak stabilization. N=5 is chosen to capture the most recent regime (P35-P39), which smoothed out the hyper-peak from P33/P34.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand regime (mid-Oct to early Nov) averaged ~119 units, with a noticeable drop to 79 units in the most recent period (P39), suggesting a possible start to late-season deceleration.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-18 (Period 41). We are in a late autumn seasonal phase for the SKU, a fitted long-sleeved jersey top. Following the extreme hyper-peak in Period 33 (522 units), demand has stabilized significantly. Over the last six periods (P35-P40), the average demand is approximately 115 units, though the last two weeks (P39-P40) have seen a decrease to an average of 87.5. Given the product's nature, we expect a seasonal glide-path downward as we approach the end of the year, but demand remains robust enough to require stock. On-hand inventory is currently 102 units, with zero in-transit. Based on the recent 6-period average of ~115, and the most recent 2-period average of ~88, I will set mu_hat to 100 to strike a balance between the mid-autumn regime and the late-season deceleration. Since actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will continue using the default (promised) lead time. I will use a recent_N calculation for sigma_hat (N=6) to capture the current volatility while ignoring the massive outlier from Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand (Nov) has settled into a stabilized regime averaging ~90-115 units, significantly lower than the Sep hyper-peak but higher than the summer floor.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the late autumn demand regime for this long-sleeved jersey top. Demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P39-P41) at an average of ~83 units (79, 96, 74), down from the mid-autumn average of ~120. This indicates a seasonal taper as winter approaches. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all concluded data. I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this most recent stabilized lower demand level (~83 units per period). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=3) to reflect current volatility. With 71 units on hand and 0 in transit, the OR backend will calculate a base stock target and order the difference to maintain service levels for this end-of-season period.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand stabilization: Periods 39-41 show a consistent demand regime averaging 83 units, a ~30% decrease from the mid-autumn average (~120 units).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked unexpectedly to 310 units, far exceeding the recent stable regime of ~83 units. This spike coincides with 'Black Friday' week (late November), which frequently triggers massive demand for basic apparel like long-sleeved jersey tops. Because this is likely a short-term promotional or seasonal event (a 'hyper-peak' similar to Period 33), setting forecast parameters based on this single outlier would lead to excessive overstocking in December. However, demand in Period 33 (late September/early October) was followed by a sustained higher regime (~130 units) before settling. I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bridge the gap between the pre-spike average (~83) and the potential post-spike stabilization. Given historical patterns of late-year demand for jersey basics, I forecast a mean of 110 units per period for the immediate future. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility including the spike, ensuring the OR backend handles the risk of further volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday demand surge detected in Period 42: Demand reached 310 units, a nearly 4x increase over the November average (~83), mirroring the late-September hyper-peak pattern.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 demand (December 2nd) fell sharply to 49 units following the Black Friday surge (P42, 310 units). This indicates a typical post-holiday demand collapse rather than a sustained high regime. The current on-hand inventory of 249 units is sufficient to cover approximately five weeks of demand at the current rate (~50 units/period). Historically, lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. For Period 44, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the pre-and-post holiday volatility (averages ~132 units), while adjusting sigma_hat to reflect the high variance seen during the Black Friday peak. This ensures we don't over-order into a potential end-of-year seasonal decline while staying protected against the noise of the recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand collapse: Period 43 demand (49) dropped 84% from the P42 peak (310), returning to a level 40% below the November average (~83).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in mid-December (2019/12/16, Period 45). Examining the recent post-Black Friday demand (P43=49, P44=58) and comparing it to the late autumn baseline (P39-P41 avg ~83), there is a clear deceleration in demand for this long-sleeved jersey top as the season winds down. The Black Friday spike (P42=310) was a temporary event, followed by a significant collapse. Given we have 272 units on-hand and recent demand is averaging ~54 units (P43-P44), we are currently overstocked for the remaining 3 periods of the game. Our goal is to minimize holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer. I will use a recent_N of 2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-season low-demand regime. This will significantly lower the order target, allowing the excess on-hand inventory to be consumed.

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand deceleration: post-Black Friday demand (P43-P44) has stabilized at ~54 units, a 35% decrease from the November baseline (~83 units), indicating the final seasonal wind-down.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). Demand for the 'Brittany LS' (long-sleeved top) has entered a final seasonal wind-down phase following the Black Friday surge. Over the last three periods (P43-P45), demand has averaged approximately 54 units (49, 58, 55), down from the November pre-peak average of ~83 units. With an on-hand inventory of 217 units, we currently hold enough stock to cover roughly 4 periods of demand at the current average rate. Given the product is a seasonal long-sleeved item and we are approaching the end of the year, holding excessive inventory will lead to unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period) with diminishing sales prospects. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (average 54) to reflect this late-season deceleration. Lead time remains consistently 0. No additional orders are likely needed given the current stock levels, so the OR backend should naturally suppress ordering as on-hand exceeds the calculated base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $483.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the final decision period (Period 47, Dec 30). The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is entering a post-holiday seasonal decline. Demand in the most recent period (P46) was 35 units, continuing the downward trend from the post-Black Friday stabilization level of ~55 units. With 182 units currently on-hand and 0 units in-transit, we are significantly overstocked for the expected year-end demand. My goal is to minimize holding costs while liquidating the remaining stock. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (N=3) to reflect the late-December decline, and given we have several weeks' worth of safety stock already on-hand, the OR backend will correctly result in 0 new orders.

Carry-over insight: Year-end seasonal decline confirmed: Demand in late December (P46=35) dropped 36% below the mid-December average (~55), following the standard seasonal wind-down for long-sleeved items.
