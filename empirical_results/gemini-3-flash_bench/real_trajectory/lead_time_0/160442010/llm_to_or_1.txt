Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Starting Period 1 for SKU 160442010 (3p Sneaker Socks). Current date is 2019-02-11. We have 5 historical demand samples (84, 54, 56, 70, 72) with a mean of 67.2 and a standard deviation of 12.3. The product is a staple item (sneaker socks). Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0), the backend's optimal service level 'q' will be 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock will target the mean demand. Since promised lead time is 0, we need to cover demand for current period (L+1 = 1). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the full recent statistical profile while allowing for adjustments in future periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 starts with 0 on-hand inventory. In Period 1, 68 units were ordered and arrived immediately (lead_time 0), but demand was 81, resulting in a stockout (sold 68). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which are a core basics item. Historical demand samples (84, 54, 56, 70, 72) plus the Period 1 demand of 81 show a mean demand around 69.5. Given the stockout in Period 1 and the relatively stable demand trend, I will use recent_N to capture the slightly higher recent demand average while maintaining the promised lead time of 0. L will be set to 'calculate' to benefit from the confirmed lead_time of 0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a seasonal item likely seeing increased demand as spring approaches (Feb/March). Historical demand was initially stable (avg ~67), but Period 2 saw a massive spike to 199. Period 1 and 2 both experienced stockouts (on-hand 0, sold < demand) because the OR backend's capped policy and base stock calculations, using historical averages of ~67, were overwhelmed by the surge. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this demand regime shift, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a higher inventory buffer. I will use the average of the last 3 samples (72, 81, 199) which is ~117. With L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*117. I'll also set sigma_hat explicitly to 50 to reflect the increased volatility seen in the move from 81 to 199.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected at Period 2 (2019-02-18): Demand spiked from ~70-80 to 199 (+150-180%), leading to immediate stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a seasonal item that typically sees a demand surge in early spring as consumers switch to low-cut footwear. Demand has escalated rapidly from an average of ~67 (Periods 1-4 sample history) to 199 in Period 2 and 245 in Period 3. This represents a sustained regime shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 0 in-transit, as previous orders were immediately sold out. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (P1, P2, and P3 orders all arrived same-period). To prevent further stockouts during this rising trend, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. Given the progression (199 -> 245), I expect demand for Period 4 to be at least 250-280. I will set mu_hat (covering Period 4 demand) to (1+L)*280 = 280. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat to account for high volatility seen during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand increased from ~70 in Jan/Feb to 222 average in Feb 18 - Feb 25 (+217%) matching spring seasonal reset for low-cut hosiery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-16.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a low-cut item that aligns with the spring seasonal reset as confirmed in carry-over insights. Total demand since the shift (Period 2-4) averages 192 units (199, 245, 132), though it fluctuated recently. The Period 4 demand (132) was lower than P3 (245), possibly due to transient factors or stabilization after an initial seasonal surge. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the high-demand regime from Period 2 onwards, which calculates as (1+0) * ((199+245+132)/3) \u2248 192. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to capture current volatility following the regime shift. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand (mu_hat). With 148 on-hand and a calculated base_stock around 192, a moderate order will be triggered to maintain availability for the upcoming spring weeks.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product '3p Sneaker Socks' experienced a massive demand shift starting in mid-February (Period 2), peaking at 245 units in Period 3. This aligns with a 'Spring Reset' as consumers transition to low-cut footwear. Recent demand (Periods 4 and 5) has stabilized at a lower but still elevated level (avg ~134) compared to the January baseline (~60-70). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend's target service level (q) will be 0.50 (z*=0), effectively targeting the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the current post-peak stabilization level (avg 134) for mu_hat, rather than the lifetime mean which is dragged down by Jan/early Feb data or the extreme peak in Period 3. For sigma_hat, I'll use N=4 to include the peak period to ensure the backend accounts for the high volatility seen since the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-peak (Periods 4-5) at an average of 134 units, significantly higher than the pre-Feb baseline of ~70 but lower than the Period 2-3 surge peak of 222.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a highly seasonal item as weather warms in spring (March). Current date is March 25. Historical demand shows a baseline of ~70 in Jan/Feb, a significant spike in Period 2-3 (avg 222), a stabilization in Period 4-5 (avg 134), and a massive secondary spike in Period 6 (243). The carry-over insight from Period 6 suggested a stabilization at 134, but the actual Period 6 demand of 243 invalidates that 'stabilization' theory, suggesting instead that the spring season is driving sustained high and volatile demand. I am now at 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts during this peak season, I will use recent_N (N=5: Periods 2-6) to capture this higher demand regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods is 191 units. By setting mu_hat to this level and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the high volatility (std dev is ~55), I allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for these sudden spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 6 demand (243) represents a secondary peak, invalidating the previous 'stabilization' at 134. Average demand since the Feb 18 shift (Periods 2-6) is 191 units with high volatility (std ~55).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a highly seasonal item as spring arrives in April. The historical demand data exhibits a strong upward trend since the shift on Feb 18 (Period 2). Recent demand in Periods 6 and 7 (243 and 302 respectively) far exceeds earlier averages, resulting in consecutive stockouts even after increasing order quantities. The average demand over the last 6 periods (since the shift) is approximately 209 units, but the last 2 periods average 272. Given the stockout at Period 7 (sold 191 of 302 demand), the true market demand is likely increasing further as temperatures rise. I will use an explicit mu_hat to capture this peak seasonal demand, targeting the level seen in the most recent period (~300) to minimize further lost sales, while maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this category.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand growth: demand has increased from an average of ~200 (Periods 2-5) to ~270+ (Periods 6-7), confirming a peak spring season for sneaker socks.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a highly seasonal item for spring and summer. Current status (Period 9, April 8th) shows we are entering the peak demand season. Historical demand has scaled rapidly from ~70 units in Jan/Feb to over 300 units in the most recent period (Period 8: 343 units). We have stocked out in four of the last five periods because the OR backend's order cap and base stock calculations are lagging behind this rapid seasonal surge. Since lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, the OR engine calculates base stock for (L+1)=1 period of demand. To capture this growth and prevent further stockouts, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it slightly above the most recent demand (360) to account for the continued upward trend in April. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high volatility seen during the recent shift (std dev of demand from Periods 5-8 is approx 90-100).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak acceleration: Demand for sneaker socks has surpassed 300 units/period as of April, up from 134 in mid-March, confirming a strong spring seasonal trend.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Sneaker Socks' (low-cut hosiery), which is currently in its peak spring seasonal demand (April). Historical demand since mid-March (Periods 6-9) has been highly volatile but generally high: 243, 302, 343, and 208. The drop in Period 9 to 208 units followed a peak of 343, indicating high variance during the seasonal ramp-up. The average demand over the last four periods (since the start of the April acceleration) is 274 units. Given that Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level (q = 0.5), which may lead to stockouts if demand remains volatile. I will use the recent N=4 periods to capture the current seasonal mean (~274) and variance, ensuring the mu_hat accounts for the (1+L) period demand window.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Sneaker Socks', which is experiencing a clear spring seasonal surge as temperatures rise in April. Historical data shows demand has accelerated from ~130 in March to over 300 in April. In Period 10, the actual demand was 361, but we only sold 274 due to limited inventory, leading to a stockout. With a promised and observed actual lead time of 0 periods, we must ensure the base stock is high enough to cover this peak demand. The current average demand for April (Periods 8-10) is 304 units ((343+208+361)/3). Given the most recent demand was 361 and the trend is generally upward for this category in spring, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the April average (~304) and use explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed (std of 71 in the last three periods). This ensures we buffer against the risk of further stockouts during this high-demand window.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand in April: Demand for sneaker socks has averaged 304 units over the last 3 periods (April), confirming it as the peak seasonal window compared to the March average of ~170.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Sneaker Socks', which are highly seasonal, appearing to peak in mid-to-late spring (April). Current status shows zero inventory on-hand and zero in-transit, as lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Historical demand in April (Periods 8-11) has been 343, 208, 361, and 392, averaging approximately 326 units. The most recent demand (392) is the highest yet, suggesting the peak is still active or accelerating as we enter the end of April/beginning of May. Previous 'stabilization' points were invalidated by further spikes, so I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (April data) using N=4. Lead time calculation remains 'calculate' as it has consistently arrived in 0 periods. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the significant volatility observed during this peak season, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level across the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: April seasonal peak confirmed: Demand for sneaker socks reached a new high of 392 in late April (Period 11), with an April average of 326 (Periods 8-11) compared to the March average of ~170.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Sneaker Socks', which is seeing a significant seasonal uptrend as we move into May. Demand in April (Periods 8-11) averaged 326 units. Period 12 demand remains high at 369 units, confirming that we are still in the peak seasonal phase. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory currently sits at 0, meaning we lost some sales in Period 12 (demand 369 vs arrived 326). To capture this sustained high demand while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (equating to a 50% target service level in a standard newsboy context, though the OR backend's z-score calculation q = p/(p+h) will naturally target 0.5 or 50% for the base stock calculation), I will use the last 5 periods (Periods 8-12) to capture the April/May demand regime. This period covers demand values of 343, 208, 361, 392, and 369, averaging 334.6 per period.

Carry-over insight: May seasonal demand sustained: Period 12 demand (369) aligns with the late-April peak (392), confirming a high-demand plateau for sneaker socks entering May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Sneaker Socks', a highly seasonal item for spring/summer. The current date is May 13, and recent history (Periods 8-12) shows a clear peak plateau in demand (averages ~335). Period 13 saw a slight drop to 267, but this is still well within the seasonal high range. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for immediate reaction. I will use a recent_N (N=6) approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the April/May average (approx 323 units) which balances the late-April peak with the early-May slight cooling, ensuring the base stock covers this sustained seasonal plateau. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the significant volatility observed during this high-demand window (samples range from 208 to 392).

Carry-over insight: May mid-season status: Demand remains in the seasonal high plateau established in April; Period 13 (267) is slightly lower than the April peak but consistent with the spring/summer 'sneaker socks' use case.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442010' (Womens Sneaker Socks) is currently in its peak spring/summer demand season. Analyzing the demand history from April to mid-May (Periods 8-14), the demand has consistently remained high with an average of approximately 326 units. Recent demand in the last two periods was 267 and 262, suggesting a slight stabilization or leveling off from the absolute peaks seen in late April (392). On-hand inventory is currently low (62 units). Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set parameters to ensure we capture the current high baseline and provide a buffer for volatility. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to cover the entire April-May seasonal plateau (average ~326 per period) to ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers the current demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the high volatility seen during this peak period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Sneaker Socks) is in its peak seasonal demand phase (late spring/early summer), which aligns with the provided carry-over insights. Recent demand has stabilized at a high plateau: Period 13 (267), Period 14 (262), and Period 15 (308). The average demand over these last 3 periods is 279, which is slightly down from the absolute April peak (~326) but significantly higher than the early season. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims to satisfy the median demand. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To capture the current seasonal plateau without overreacting to the April extreme peaks or the earlier low baselines, I will use a recent_N window for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focused on the last 5 periods (Periods 11-15), which covers the high-demand April/May window.

Carry-over insight: May/June high-demand plateau confirmed: Average demand for late May (Periods 13-15) settled at 279 units, down from April peak (~330) but representing a stable seasonal high-summer regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (3p Sneaker Socks) is in its peak seasonal window (June 3rd). Period 16 demand jumped to 383, which is the second-highest observed value, indicating that demand is accelerating again as we move deeper into summer. The June seasonal regime is performing similarly to the late April peak (392). My objective is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current high-demand plateau (approximately 300-400 units). I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the averages from the last four periods (May/early June), where demand has been 267, 262, 308, and 383. This gives an average of approximately 305/period. Setting mu_hat using N=4 ensures we account for the recent resurgence in demand while balancing against the slightly lower mid-May values. Since the lead time is consistently 0, L remains default.

Carry-over insight: Early June demand surge: Period 16 demand (383) confirms a return to peak-seasonal levels (~380+) similar to late April, following a slightly lower mid-May plateau (~260-300).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442010' (3p Sneaker Socks) is currently in its peak summer season (June). Demand in Period 16 (383) and Period 17 (282) confirms that we are oscillating within a high plateau of approximately 280-380 units per period. The recent history (Periods 11-17) shows an average demand of 338 units. Period 17 conclude showed demand of 282, which is a minor dip compared to the Period 16 surge, but still representative of high summer sales. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture the current seasonal regime while accounting for the high volatility observed between periods (383 vs 282), I will use the last 5 periods (since mid-May) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=5 (Periods 13-17) gives a contemporary average that reflects the transition from the late-May plateau into the June peak, helping the OR backend set a base stock that minimizes stockouts during this high-risk seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: June demand remains in a high-volatility peak regime (280-380 units), mirroring late-April levels and confirming sustained summer seasonality for sneaker socks.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (sneaker socks) remains in its peak seasonal demand phase (Spring/Summer). Demand in Period 18 was 280, following 282 in Period 17 and 383 in Period 16. The current demand regime (Periods 11-18) consistently fluctuates between ~260 and ~390 units, with a mean of 330.5 units and a standard deviation of approximately 50. Since the lead time is reliably 0 periods, I will set L to default. I am using mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current high-demand plateau observed throughout April, May, and early June. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to account for the sustained high volatility in this peak season. This ensures the base stock calculation (\u03bc + z\u03c3) covers the high end of possible demand while maintaining the desired service level.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (women's sneaker socks) is in its peak summer seasonal phase (Period 20, Late June). Demand has stabilized at a high-volume, high-volatility plateau. Over the last 7 periods (Periods 13-19), the average demand is approximately 298.2 units (ranging from 262 to 383), with a standard deviation of approximately 44. Since the lead time is consistently 0 (as confirmed by every period in history), the base stock level must effectively cover the current period's demand. The current on-hand inventory is 17 units. Considering the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5, which aligns the base stock with the mean demand. However, historical volatility suggests a buffer is necessary to prevent stockouts during peak surges like Period 16 (383 units). I will use a recent window of N=7 to capture this summer plateau (since Period 13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring we account for the current demand regime's mean and variability.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand plateau confirmed: Since Period 13 (early May), demand for sneaker socks has averaged ~298 units with a standard deviation of ~44, representing a stable high-season regime following the April peaks.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which is a high-demand seasonal item during the summer months. As of Period 21 (July 1st), we are in the middle of the summer peak. Demand analysis for the last 8 periods (late May through June) shows a stable regime where demand fluctuates between 280 and 383, with an average of approximately 300 units. Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat captures this sustained summer plateau while ignoring the earlier April peaks. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), allowing for highly responsive inventory management. The critical goal is to avoid the frequent stockouts observed in the spring by setting sigma_hat to reflect the volatility (standard deviation ~38) observed in the current high-demand regime. Setting N=8 for all parameters aligns the OR backend's calculations with the most relevant summer demand pattern.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks (160442010) has entered a potential transition out of its peak summer plateau. In Period 21 (early July), demand dropped to 198 units, which is significantly lower than the ~300 unit average maintained since mid-May (Periods 13-20). This could signal the end of the high-summer peak as consumers transition toward autumn footwear. However, a single data point is not enough to confirm a new regime; historical demand from April to June showed occasional volatility. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (covering the summer period from mid-May to the present) to allow the OR engine to adapt to the lower July reading while maintaining enough safety stock to handle a potential late-summer bounce. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '3p Sneaker Socks' is entering mid-July. Historically, demand peaked in April and June (~300-380 units/period) and has shown a consistent decline in the most recent two periods (P21: 198, P22: 209), suggesting the peak summer season is tapering off. The recent average (P21-P22) is ~203 units, which is significantly lower than the previous summer plateau of ~298. Moving from the high-summer regime to a post-peak regime. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the high volatility (std remains significant). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 (2019-07-01): Sneaker socks demand has dropped from a ~300 average to ~200 average (-33%), indicating the end of the peak summer seasonal window.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for sneaker socks shifted at Period 21 (July 1st), dropping from a summer peak average of ~300 to a new baseline of ~200. Observations for Periods 21-23 show demand values of 198, 209, and 188 respectively. This confirms a significant and sustained step-down as we move away from the peak summer sneaker season. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this post-peak regime (P21-P23) accurately. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival, so L is set to default. Current on-hand inventory is 41 units, which the OR engine will subtract from the calculated base stock to determine the final order for Period 24.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '3p Sneaker Socks' has clearly entered a post-peak summer decline, as identified in the Period 23 carry-over insight. Recent demand values are 198, 209, 188, and now 109. The drop to 109 in Period 24 suggests the downward trend is accelerating as we move further into late July. Because the holding cost and profit are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the expected mean demand for the lead time plus review period (1+L). Given the recent volatility and the sharp drop to 109, I will use a short window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the most recent cooling of demand (average ~176) rather than the older ~200+ figures. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I'll maintain recent_N for sigma_hat as well to account for the current regime's variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand drop confirmed at Period 24: Demand fell to 109, a ~45% decrease from the previous 3-period average (~198), indicating a sharp late-summer seasonal decline for sneaker socks.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442010' (3p Sneaker Socks) is exhibiting a clear post-peak seasonal decline as we move into August. Period 26 corresponds to August 5th. Historically, for this item, demand peaked in April/May/June (avg ~300) and dropped in July (avg ~198). The most recent two periods (Periods 24 and 25) show demand reaching new lows of 109 and 121, respectively. This confirms a sustained regime shift toward a lower demand level characteristic of late-summer/pre-autumn. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this declining phase, I am moving to 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent drop (Periods 23-25 avg: 139), which aligns with the observed demand of ~110-120. Standard deviation is also likely to settle at a lower absolute value, so I will apply recent_N with N=5 to sigma_hat to reflect the transition from the highly volatile summer peaks to the current steadier decline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal decline solidified: Demand has fallen from a July average of ~200 to an early August baseline of ~115 (Periods 24-25 average: 115), reflecting a -42% drop from the July regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (sneaker socks) has clearly exited its peak spring/summer seasonal window. Demand has shifted from a ~300 average (April-June) to ~200 in July, and has now settled into a lower August baseline. Recent demand observations for the last three periods (Periods 24-26) are 109, 121, and 131, averaging approximately 120 units per period. This represents a significant decline compared to the July average of ~198. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent conclude messages. Given the steady decline and the current date (mid-August), I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this new lower demand regime. I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the most current August trend (N=3: 109, 121, 131). This allows the OR backend to target a base stock appropriate for the late-summer/pre-autumn level while keeping holding costs in check as the peak season ends.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (sneaker socks) has clearly exited its peak spring/summer seasonal window. Since Period 24 (late July), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower baseline. The demand values for the last four periods are 109, 121, 131, and 95, resulting in an average of approximately 114 units. This confirms the 'post-peak seasonal decline' noted in the carry-over insights. For Period 28, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture this new, lower demand regime (approx 114 units) while allowing for the observed volatility (std ~15-20). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 26, requiring an order to meet the forecasted demand of ~114 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern for 'sneaker socks': a spring/summer peak (~300 units/period) that has transitioned into a late-summer decline starting in July (Period 21). The last five periods (24-28) show demand has settled into a significantly lower regime, averaging 107 units per period (109, 121, 131, 95, 80). The most recent three samples show even lower levels (131, 95, 80, avg 102). To prevent excessive inventory buildup as the season ends, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this established lower-demand regime while ignoring the prior high-season data. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal regime (Late August): Demand has stabilized at a lower baseline of approximately 107 units/period (Periods 24-28), down 64% from the summer peak (~300).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is sneaker socks, which are highly seasonal. We are now in Period 30 (early September), following a confirmed sharp decline from the summer peak (~300 units) to a late-summer baseline. Demand over the last 6 periods (Periods 24-29) has averaged 104 units (109, 121, 131, 95, 80, 88), showing relative stability at this lower volume. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations consistently show an actual lead time of 0. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to reflect this new stabilized low-demand regime, and use recent volatility (N=6) for sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering based on the high summer variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained post-peak stabilization: Demand has consistently remained between 80-130 units for the last 6 periods (late July to August), confirming a stable autumn baseline of ~104 units/period, down from the ~300 unit summer peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Sneaker Socks', which is highly seasonal. We are now in Period 31 (September 9). Historical demand shows a clear peak in spring and summer (April-June) reaching up to 392 units, followed by a significant decline starting in July. For the last 7 periods (Periods 24-30), demand has stabilized into a post-peak autumn regime, averaging 103.4 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. Specifically, the last three periods show demand of 80, 88, and 96, indicating a very stable but low baseline compared to the summer. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this lower-demand period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 7-period regime (N=7). This covers the stabilization period from late July through August.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (3p Sneaker Socks) is now in a stable post-summer seasonal regime. Demand has stabilized at a lower baseline significantly below the summer peak of ~300. Over the last 8 periods (Periods 24-31), demand has averaged 100.375 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18.5. The most recent demand (Period 31) was 79, reinforcing this lower baseline. Given the transition into late September, I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining enough sensitivity to detect further autumn shifts. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with all historical observations.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed (Periods 24-31): Demand for sneaker socks has averaged 100.4 units/period, establishing a stable autumn baseline significantly lower than the ~300 unit summer peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. This SKU (Womens 3p Sneaker Socks) is now firmly in its autumn seasonal baseline. Demand has consistently stabilized following the summer peak (which was ~300 units). Over the last 9 periods (Periods 24-32), the average demand has been approximately 100 units. The most recent 3 periods (Periods 30-32) show a slight further cooling to an average of ~82 units. I will use a recent_N approach with N=9 to capture this stable post-summer regime. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0, matching the promised lead time. The OR backend needs to maintain this lower base stock to avoid excess holding costs, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (2019/9/23), there was a sudden demand spike to 183 units, breaking the established 'post-summer stabilization' regime that averaged ~100 units (Periods 24-32). This spike likely corresponds to a late-September/early-October transition (e.g., back-to-school completion or a mid-season promotion). Since our on-hand inventory was only 97, we experienced a stockout. To adapt to this potential new volatility or temporary surge, I am shifting mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to a 'recent_N' approach (N=4) to capture the higher 183 value and the preceding low values, resulting in a more responsive baseline while awaiting confirmation of a sustained shift. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand surge detected at Period 33 (2019-09-23): Demand jumped to 183 from a 9-period average of ~100 (+83%), though further data is needed to confirm if this is a new regime or a one-off spike.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand spike observed in Period 33 (183 units) was immediately followed by a sharp drop in Period 34 (50 units), bringing the two-period average to 116.5. This average is much closer to the established autumn baseline of ~100 units than a sustained high regime. The Period 33 spike was likely a one-off fluctuation (perhaps an early back-to-school or promotional ripple) rather than a regime shift, especially given that sneaker socks are highly seasonal for spring/summer and typically decline in autumn. Consequently, I am maintaining the forecast based on the post-summer stable period (Periods 24-34), using N=11 to capture the full autumn baseline including recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'concluded' messages.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: The demand spike in Period 33 (183) appears to be a transitory variance rather than a regime shift, as Period 34 demand fell to 50. The autumn baseline (P24-P34) remains stable at approximately 102 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 34-35) shows a significant cooling of demand (50 and 43 units respectively) following a brief spike in Period 33 (183). This suggests the autumn baseline is settling lower than the previously estimated 100 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 85.4 units, reflecting a clear downtrend as we move into mid-October (Date: 2019/10/14), which is logically a transitional period for sneaker socks. Given on-hand inventory is 58 and actual lead time remains consistent at 0, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this deceleration and avoid overstocking in a declining seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration in October: Average demand has dropped to 85.4 over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), compared to the 100-unit baseline in late August/September.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (sneaker socks) has moved past its peak spring/summer season and is currently in a stable autumn regime. Demand in October (Periods 34-36) has been consistently low (50, 43, 51), significantly lower than the ~100 unit baseline seen in early September. The 'spike' in Period 33 (183) appears to be a clear outlier. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this decelerating phase, I will use a recent demand window that captures this October slowdown while smoothing out the volatility of the shoulder season. I've chosen N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include the stable October data and late September stabilization, filtering out the transient spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed in October: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P34-P36) is 48 units, representing a further ~50% drop from the September baseline of ~100 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks is in a significant late-autumn decline as colder weather reduces the utility of 'hidden' socks. The recent 4-period demand (P34-P37) has averaged 50 units (50, 43, 51, 53), which is a clear 50% drop from the September stabilization level (~100 units). Demand is now very stable at this lower volume. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this new late-October regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, but I will use the 'calculate' method to allow the backend to use all historical lead time data (which consistently shows 0). Setting parameters based on the last 4 periods will prevent overstocking as we head further into the low-season.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime shift confirmed at Period 34 (2019-09-30): Demand has halved from the September baseline (~100) to a new stable baseline of ~50 units/period (average P34-P37 = 49.25), reflecting seasonal irrelevance of sneaker socks in colder months.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is sneaker socks, which are highly seasonal and currently in a late-autumn decline as temperatures drop. Following a stabilization at ~100 units in September, demand halved to a new baseline of approximately 50 units starting in October (Period 34). Recent performance (Periods 34-38) shows demand levels of 50, 43, 51, 53, and 62, yielding an average of 51.8. The most recent demand (62) shows a slight uptick but remains within the low-seasonal regime. To capture this lower, stable demand while remaining responsive to slight variations, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the data since the late-autumn shift (P34). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442010' (sneaker socks) is in a stable late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Demand historically plummeted in July/August and further halved at the end of September (Period 34). For the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 50.3 units (50, 43, 51, 53, 62, 43), with a standard deviation of approximately 7.6. Current high-seasonality for sneaker socks is over. With Period 40 starting on 2019/11/11, there is no expectation of a significant surge before the end of the game at Period 47. Lead time remains consistently at 0. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture this stable ~50 unit baseline, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to match the current low volatility, preventing excess holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the 50-60 unit demand range.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product (sneaker socks) remains in its late-autumn seasonal low, as previously identified. Since Period 34 (Sep 30), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower baseline. The average demand for the last 7 periods (P34-P40) is 51.2 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 6.5. This confirms a very stable, low-demand regime for the winter months. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain efficiency and minimize holding costs while ensuring a high service level, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7). This aligns the base stock with the current seasonal reality (approx. 50 units/period) rather than the much higher annual average influenced by the summer peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-25. The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which has shown a strong seasonal decline since late September. A demand regime shift was confirmed at Period 34, with average demand dropping from approximately 100 units to a stable late-autumn baseline of around 50 units. Over the last 4 periods (P38-P41), demand values were 62, 43, 56, and 44, yielding an average of 51.25. This confirms the previously identified regime of ~50 units per period is holding steady. With a promised lead time (L) of 0 and consistent arrival history (L=0 confirmed), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the period since the late-October stabilization) to capture this low-season mean accurately. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=8 to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the summer peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks in Period 42 (Nov 25) surged to 140, a significant (+180%) increase over the late-autumn baseline of ~50. Given the date (Cyber Monday/Black Friday week), this is likely a Thanksgiving/Holiday promotional spike rather than a permanent regime shift. However, as sneaker socks are often purchased as stocking stuffers or for indoor use during holidays, some elevated demand might persist into early December. The previous baseline (P34-P41) averaged 52 units, while the recent spike (P42) was 140. To avoid excessive overstocking on a likely transitory spike while protecting against sustained holiday interest, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (averaging P38-P42: ~69 units) to acknowledge the spike without overreacting. Lead time remains stable at 0. On-hand is 0, so the backend will order to meet the base stock based on the localized mean.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 (2019-11-25) demand jumped to 140 (+180% vs Nov avg of 50), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales.

Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand in Period 42 (Nov 25) spiked to 140 due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, but immediately dropped to 24 in Period 43, confirming the holiday surge was transitory. The current late-autumn/winter regime (excluding the outlier) averages approximately 50 units (Periods 34-41 average: 50.4). Given it is now early December, demand is expected to remain at this lower winter baseline for 'sneaker socks' which are seasonally less relevant. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this ~50 unit baseline using recent_N (N=9, covering P34-P43 excluding the outlier) to ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the transitory spike, while maintaining a slight buffer for residual holiday volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) confirmed as transitory: Period 42 demand reached 140 but Period 43 immediately returned to 24, reinforcing the ~50 unit winter baseline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. Historical demand for the last few periods (P43-P44) has dropped significantly to 24 and 19 units respectively, following the transitory Black Friday spike in P42 (140). This decline confirms that we are in a deep-winter low-demand regime for sneaker socks. The average demand for the last 5 non-peak periods (excluding P42) is approximately 36 units (P40:56, P41:44, P43:24, P44:19, P39:43). Given that 39 units are already on-hand and lead time remains 0, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods to capture the downward trend toward mid-winter lows. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-winter demand trough confirmed: Demand for sneaker socks has further declined in December, averaging ~21.5 units in the last two periods (P43-P44) as cold weather persists.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. We are in the 'deep winter' regime for sneaker socks, which are seasonally low in demand during cold months. Following the transitory Black Friday spike in Period 42 (140 units), demand has returned to a very low baseline. The last three periods (P43-P45) show demand values of 24, 19, and 26, averaging 23 units per period. This confirms the 'mid-winter demand trough' noted in carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is 0 and on-hand is 31, which already covers more than one period of the current mean demand (23). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stable winter baseline and avoid over-ordering based on the high-demand summer history or the late-November spike.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product (3p Sneaker Socks) is in its deep-winter seasonal trough. Since the transition to colder months (around Period 34), demand has shifted from an average of ~100 to ~50, and recently plummeted further to a mid-winter level of ~23 units/period (average P43-P46: 23.5). The holiday spike in P42 (140) was confirmed as transitory. Period 46 demand was 25 units, consistent with the late December lows. Currently, on-hand inventory is 6 units. To avoid overstocking while holding costs equal profit ($1.00), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (P43-P46) to reflect this winter baseline (recent_N=4). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-winter demand floor confirmed: From Period 43 to 46 (December), demand for sneaker socks has averaged 23.5 units per period, down from the 50-unit November baseline.
