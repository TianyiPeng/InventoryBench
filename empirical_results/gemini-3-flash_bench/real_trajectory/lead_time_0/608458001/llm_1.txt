  "rationale": "For Period 1 (2019-02-11), we are managing 'Band leggings' for women. Historical data from January to early February 2019 shows a stable demand regime with a mean of approximately 100 units per week (92 to 104 range). There are no immediate major retail holidays in mid-February that typically cause massive spikes for basic jersey leggings, though we are approaching the transition to Spring fashion. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period and be available to satisfy this period's demand. Current on-hand inventory and in-transit units are both 0. To maximize profit while minimizing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit, $1), I need to cover the expected demand for the current period and maintain a small safety buffer. Given the stable history, I will forecast 100 units for Period 1. Since I have 0 inventory, I must order at least 100 to meet demand. I will order 105 units to provide a small buffer for variance, keeping in mind that holding cost is high, so overstocking is as penalized as a sale.",
