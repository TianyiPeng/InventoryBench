  "rationale": "Product 688537004 is described as 'Cheeky Tanga Swimwear' (Womens Swimwear). Given the current date (February 11, 2019), we are approaching the North American/European spring and summer seasons. Demand history shows a starting baseline of 0 units in early January, rising to 69 in late January and stabilizing at 88 units for the first two weeks of February. This confirms a clear seasonal ramp-up. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed today should arrive within Period 1 and be available for the same period's demand. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To cover the current demand (approx. 88-90 units) and prepare for the likely continued seasonal increase as spring approaches, I will order 120 units. This allows us to meet the immediate 88+ unit demand and provides a buffer for further growth while keeping holding costs manageable at $1.0/unit.",

  "rationale": "The product is a swimwear item (bikini bottom), which is highly seasonal. We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), the week of Christmas. Historically, the demand floor for this off-season period has stabilized around 32-37 units (P43: 37, P44: 35, P45: 32). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I have 18 units on hand. Given the dates, I expect a small holiday-related bump or at least maintenance of the current baseline of ~35. Looking ahead to P47 (Dec 30), demand may rise slightly as customers prepare for winter-sun vacations or New Year's trips, though the main seasonal surge isn't expected until Spring. Targeting a stock level of 50 units (current on-hand 18 + order 32) will cover expected demand of ~35 units with a modest safety buffer to prevent stockouts while minimizing holding costs during the low season.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a women's bikini bottom, which has highly seasonal demand. We are currently in Period 47 (2019-12-30), which is the week following Christmas. Historically, demand for this item entered a low season starting in September/October, averaging roughly 30-40 units per week. There was a brief spike in Period 42 (75 units) likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, but demand has since returned to a low baseline. Most recently, Period 46 (Dec 23 week) saw a drop to 15 units, likely because customers were focused on holiday-appropriate winter clothing rather than swimwear. However, as it is now the end of December moving into January, we may see a slight 'vacation' or 'resort season' lift as customers shop for winter sun holidays, but this is usually much smaller than the Spring Break lift seen in Period 5. Given the lead time is 0, I can order exactly what I need for the current period. Current on-hand is 35. Expected demand for the final week of the year is likely between 20-40 units. I will order 5 units to bring total availability to 40, ensuring I cover a potential minor bounce-back from the holiday slump while minimizing holding cost risks for the off-season.",
