Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie/Hipster briefs). The historical demand for the past 5 weeks is [140, 45, 30, 95, 99], with a mean of 81.8. While the first sample (140) was high, the last two (95, 99) show a consistent recovery and stability around the 95-100 range. With Valentine's Day (Feb 14) occurring during this period, demand for lingerie often spikes or maintains strength. Given the inventory is currently 0, we need to establish stock quickly. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent stability (95, 99) and the preceding 30, which averages to 74.67 (scaled by 1+L). The promised lead time is 0, and we have no arrival history yet, so L is set to default.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is cotton lace hipster briefs (Womens Lingerie). History shows demand for 5 weeks prior to the game (140, 45, 30, 95, 99) and Period 1 demand was 21. Mean demand across all available samples (including P1) is approx 71.6. In Period 1, we ordered 139 units with an actual lead time of 0 periods, which arrived and satisfied the demand of 21, leaving 118 on-hand. The lead time is confirmed as 0. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent moderate levels (avg of last 4 samples: 95, 99, 21, plus the preceding 30 is roughly 61) rather than the large outlier of 140 from early January. Given the volatility (range 21 to 140), a robust sigma_hat is needed. L remains 0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Lingerie' (Hipster briefs). Observed lead time for Period 1 and Period 2 was 0, matching the promised lead time. Demand in the first two periods was 21 and 29. Historical samples provided (140, 45, 30, 95, 99) show higher demand in early January, likely due to clearance or holiday residuals. Recent demand (last 3-4 data points: 95, 99, 21, 29) suggests a lower regime than the January peak. I will use the last 5 samples (95, 99, 21, 29, and the next most recent historical point 30) to calculate a more representative mu_hat and sigma_hat for the current post-January period. This balances the recent low demand with the slightly higher pre-February levels. L is set to calculated/default as arrivals are consistently same-period.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is 'Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p' (Womens Lingerie). Current date is March 4, 2019. This is post-Valentine's Day, moving into standard spring demand. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) were 140, 45, 30, 95, 99. Observed demand since the game started (Periods 1-3) has been 21, 29, 53, showing a rising trend over the last three weeks. Promised lead time is 0, and all three orders so far have arrived in 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 66 units. Given the rising trend in the last three weeks (mean ~34) but much higher historical peaks in Jan/Feb (mean ~82), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current upward momentum from recent actuals while maintaining a safety buffer. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains 'default' as 0 is consistent with observations.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' is a Women's Lingerie item (cotton hipster briefs). History shows demand significantly increasing over the last two periods (P3: 53, P4: 121), likely due to a seasonal shift or the lead-up to spring. Using all historical samples (including January's low values) would underestimate current demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the upward trend observed since P3. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 4 (sold 66 out of 121 demanded). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders placed and arriving in the same period. To maximize profit and recover from the stockout, I will set mu_hat to cover the expected higher demand using the most recent 3-period average, which is approximately (53+121+99)/3 = 91 (using the provided historical samples and game history).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased significantly from an average of ~30 in Feb to over 100 by early March; demand is now trending significantly higher than January/February baselines.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Womens Lingerie) has experienced a significant demand surge coinciding with the transition into March. Historical samples from early 2019 (Jan-early Feb) showed demand ranging from 30 to 140, but the most recent two periods (March 4 and March 11) have seen demand spike to 121 and 145 respectively. This confirms the 'Demand regime shift' noted in the carry-over insights. The promised lead time is 0, and all observed arrivals (Periods 1, 2, 3, and 5) have confirmed an actual lead time of 0 periods. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 2, in-transit: 0), and we stock out if we don't account for the current high-demand trend. I will use recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat to capture this higher mean (~133 per period) and set sigma_hat to explicit based on the volatility seen in the last two high-demand periods (approx 17) to provide sufficient buffer. L will remain at default as the lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1699.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for item 719957006 (Ginger Ch hipster) shows a significant shift. Early periods (P1-P2) saw demand in the 20s, but since P4 (beginning of March), demand has surged to 121, 145, and 93. This aligns with the 'carry-over insight' regarding a regime shift. As of P7 (March 25), we are entering the end of March/beginning of April. The mean demand of the last 3 periods is ~119. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in P1, P2, P3, P5, and P6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand regime while excluding the low-demand February data. The current on-hand inventory is 68, which is slightly lower than the recent demand average, necessitating a replenishment order to meet upcoming demand and maintain a safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $517.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Hipster briefs) shows a confirmed demand regime shift highlighted in previous insights. Initially (Periods 1-3), demand averaged ~34. Between Period 4 and Period 6, demand spiked significantly (avg ~120). However, Period 7 saw a sharp decline to 34 units. Observing the dates, this aligns with high volatility in early spring demand for women's lingerie. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 129 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand observation but potentially low if demand returns to the March levels (~120). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher March demand while accounting for the recent dip, ensuring we maintain a buffer without excessive holding costs. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to reflect this increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: March demand averaged ~120 followed by a 71% drop in the last week of March (Period 7), suggesting high weekly variance in this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. This SKU (Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p) has shown highly volatile demand throughout March, peaking at 145 and dropping as low as 8 in the most recent period (Period 8). The carry-over insights previously flagged a regime shift and high volatility. Historically, lead time has consistently been 0. We have 169 units on-hand, which is significantly higher than the most recent demand samples (34 and 8). To avoid excessive holding costs in what appears to be a post-peak downward trend, I am using a recent window of 5 periods (Periods 4-8) for forecasting. This captures both the March spike (121, 145, 93) and the subsequent sharp decline (34, 8), averaging 80.2 units. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR engine to react to this recent decrease in average demand while respecting the demonstrated high variance, preventing the system from over-ordering while on-hand inventory is high.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Post-seasonal demand drop confirmed: April demand started at 8 units, confirming the end of the March spike regime. Demand average has regressed from ~120 in early March back towards 70-80.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's hipster 3-pack. Reviewing the history, demand spiked significantly in March (Periods 4-6: 121, 145, 93) but has dropped sharply in April (Period 8: 8, Period 9: 31). The previous carry-over insight noted a regression towards an average of 70-80. However, the last two data points (8 and 31) suggest an even lower post-peak baseline, averaging approximately 19.5 units. The historical pre-spike baseline in early 2019 was also variable (e.g., 140, 45, 30, 95 in Jan). Given the current on-hand of 145 units vs. the most recent low demand, we are overstocked. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current cooling-off phase (Periods 7, 8, 9) while the OR backend's inventory cap prevents excessive ordering until on-hand levels normalize against the lower demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, 2019. We are observing the post-March demand environment. Historically, demand spiked in March (avg ~100-140) and has since fallen in April (Period 8: 8, Period 9: 31, Period 10: 66). The last three weeks average 35 units per week, significantly lower than the March peak but trending upwards from the mid-April low. The 'Carry-over insights' correctly identify a regime shift downward. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this lower average (approx 35) while allowing for the recent recovery. Lead time is consistently 0 (observed in Periods 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the current high volatility in these small samples. Current on-hand is 79, which is sufficient for current demand levels, so the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level for the upcoming period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The SKU is 'Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p' (Womens Lingerie). Historical demand shows a significant peak in March (averaging ~100-140) followed by a sharp decline in April. The most recent demand samples from Period 8 to Period 11 are 8, 31, 66, and 19. This confirms a lower demand regime compared to the March peak, averaging 31 units per week in April. The promised lead time is 0, and all history shows actual lead time is consistently 0. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 (covering the four samples of April) to align the base stock with the current lower demand level and avoid overstocking as we exit the peak season. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current volatility observed in the tail end of the peak.

Carry-over insight: April demand regime confirmed: Average weekly demand dropped to ~31 units following the March peak (Period 8-11), reflecting typical post-peak retail stabilization.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Historical data shows a clear seasonal peak in March (demands: 121, 145, 93) followed by a stabilization period in April. The most recent four periods (Periods 9, 10, 11, 12) exhibit demands of 31, 66, 19, and 10, respectively, resulting in a mean of 31.5. This aligns with the 'April demand regime' identified in carry-over insights. Total on-hand inventory is 63, which comfortably covers approximately two periods of the current average demand. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times consistently show 0 (same-period arrival), I will maintain L=0. I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization regime while excluding the high-variance March data, ensuring the OR backend prevents overstocking as demand cools down into May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p) has entered a low-demand regime following a significant peak in March. In the most recent four weeks (Periods 10-13), demand has been 66, 19, 10, and 3, respectively. The current date is mid-May. Historical data from late January/early February showed demand levels between 30 and 100, while the current average of the last four weeks is ~24.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 69 units, which covers nearly 3 weeks of current average demand. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and further holding costs while demand is at its seasonal floor, I am using a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilization at lower levels.

Carry-over insight: May demand stabilization confirmed: Demand has regressed to a low-volume baseline (averaging <10 units over the last two weeks), significantly lower than the April stabilization of ~31 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is mid-May (2019/5/20). Demand for this SKU has significantly decelerated following a peak in March. The last three periods (P12-P14) show demand units of 10, 3, and 2, respectively. On-hand inventory is currently 70 units, which is extremely high (35 weeks of coverage) relative to this new low-volume baseline of ~5 units/week. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid further holding costs on an already overstocked position, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N window (N=4) to reflect the 5-10 unit demand regime, and use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to capture the current lower volatility. The OR engine should generate a zero or minimal order because on-hand inventory (70) far exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The SKU (Womens Lingerie) reached a significant demand peak in March (Periods 4-6) and has since regressed through April to a very low-volume baseline in May. Over the last three weeks (Periods 13-15), demand has been consistently low at 3, 2, and 3 units respectively. With an on-hand inventory of 67 units and no units in transit, the current stock covers over 20 weeks of demand at the recent average. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the low-volume regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus exclusively on this low May baseline. This will likely result in a zero or near-zero order from the OR backend since current inventory far exceeds the base stock level for this regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. This SKU (Womens Lingerie) exhibited a significant demand spike in March (Avg ~100+), followed by a prolonged decline through April and May (averaging <10 in late May). However, Period 16 (May 27) saw a sudden surge to 68 units, which depleted all on-hand inventory. This spike aligns with the transition into June; in retail, early June often sees demand increases for summer essentials (like cotton jersey hipster briefs). Since the previous regime (May) showed very low demand, but the latest sample (Period 16) is highly significant, I will use a short N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 to capture this upward movement while tempering it with the low samples from Periods 14-15 to avoid over-ordering on a potential outlier. Since on-hand is zero and lead time is reliably 0 based on history, an aggressive update is needed to capture lost sales. \u03c3\u0302 is set to explicit to account for the high volatility shown between Period 15 (demand=3) and Period 16 (demand=68).

Carry-over insight: Period 17: June demand spike detected; Period 16 demand (68) is 20x higher than the previous 3-week average (~3). This suggests a new early-summer demand regime for lingerie products.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18 (June 10). The product is a pack of cotton hipster briefs (Womens Lingerie). Historical demand shows a mid-March peak followed by a significant decline in April and May. However, Period 16 showed a sudden demand spike (68 units), which was followed by 22 units in Period 17. This confirms a new early-summer demand regime identified in the carry-over insights. Total demand in the last two weeks is 90 units (68 + 22), averaging 45 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 69 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all observed orders (P1, P2, P3, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14, P17). I will set L to 0 (default). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the transition from the May low (3 units) to the June spike (68 and 22 units), as this provides a balanced estimate for the new summer regime (avg ~31 units/week). This should maintain a service level sufficient to cover the current volatile demand without excessive holding costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. This SKU (cotton hipster briefs) recently experienced a significant demand spike in late May (Period 16, demand=68), which was followed by a moderate demand period (Period 17, demand=22) and a very low demand period (Period 18, demand=2). This pattern suggests that while June has higher potential demand than May (which averaged <5 units), the initial spike may have been a one-time event or a highly volatile start to the summer season. Historical data from early 2019 shows demand ranging from 30 to 140. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the June shift (averaging ~31 units), but use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (standard deviation of ~34 over those three weeks) to ensure the base stock covers potential recurring spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: June demand volatility confirmed. After a spike of 68 in Period 16, demand dropped to 22 and then 2, indicating that the 'summer regime' involves high variance rather than a sustained high level.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a low-demand phase following a brief, significant spike in late May (Period 16, demand=68). The demand for the last three periods (17, 18, 19) has been 22, 2, and 4 respectively, confirming that the spike was not a sustained regime shift but an isolated event. Current on-hand inventory is 85 units, which is ample given the recent demand levels. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current post-spike stabilization while accounting for the recent high-demand outlier in the variance (sigma_hat) calculation to protect against potential June volatility. This ensures we don't over-order while we have high stock but remain prepared if another 'summer spike' occurs.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are entering the mid-summer period. Historical performance and recent carry-over insights indicate that while there was a significant demand spike in June (Period 16, demand=68), the subsequent four weeks (Periods 17-20) have shown very low demand (22, 2, 4, 3), averaging 7.75 units. The SKU is 'Womens Lingerie (hipster briefs)', which typically sees sporadic spikes often followed by flat periods rather than sustained high-growth trends. Currently, on-hand inventory is 82 units, which is more than sufficient to cover approximately 10 weeks of current average demand. Given the $1.0 holding cost versus $19.0 profit, the OR engine will prioritize avoiding overstocking. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (average including the last spike and the drop) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in June.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. This SKU (Womens Lingerie) has shown consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time = 0). Demand continues to be highly volatile; after three weeks of very low demand (2, 4, 3), Period 21 saw a jump to 28 units. This mirrors the pattern seen in June (Period 16 spike), suggesting intermittent mid-summer demand bursts rather than a sustained high-volume regime. On-hand inventory is 54 units, which is quite healthy. Given the average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 8.2 units, but with a high variance (standard deviation), I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility while preventing excessive overstocking, as the holding cost is $1.0 vs $19.0 profit. L is set to default as lead time has consistently been 0.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8) showed a significant demand surge to 104 units, resulting in a stockout. This follows a smaller uptick of 28 units in Period 21. This combined evidence suggests a mid-summer demand regime for this 'Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p' (Womens Lingerie) which aligns with typical seasonal increases. The last 4 samples (3, 28, 104, plus the previous 2 where demand was low) show high volatility. I am choosing N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent upward trend and volatility while filtering out the extremely low demand from the early June 'lull'. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The goal is to set a base stock that covers the expected high demand while acknowledging that variance has increased dramatically.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed. Demand increased from <5 units/week in late June to 28 (P21) and 104 (P22) in July, indicating a new high-demand regime for July.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Womens Lingerie - Hipster briefs) is currently in a high-demand July surge with demand reaching 104 and 111 units in the last two periods (P22, P23). This mirrors the high-volume regime seen in March (max demand 145), suggesting a potential seasonal peak or clearance-driven spike. Starting inventory for Period 24 is low at 3 units with 0 in-transit, following a stockout in P22. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the remaining July demand while managing risk, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (P21-P23: 28, 104, 111) which better reflect the current regime (mean ~81, high variance) compared to the long-term historical data. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for high profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) while reacting to the immediate volume increase.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: July demand surge established with two consecutive weeks >100 units (avg 107.5 over P22-P23), similar to the March peak regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand July regime, with demand over the last three periods (P22-P24) measuring 104, 111, and 100, averaging approximately 105 units. This mirrors the high-volume period seen in March. June/July show a pattern of high variance, but the last three weeks have established a sustained peak. With a lead time consistently at 0, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on this active surge. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the consistency of the 100+ demand level. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current 100+ unit weekly burn rate without excessively overstocking as we approach August.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak sustained: demand for Periods 22-24 averaged 105 units, confirming a high-volume mid-summer regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p) is currently in a sustained high-demand July/August regime. Historical demand for the last four periods (P22-P25) has been consistent: 104, 111, 100, and 91, resulting in a mean of 101.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Inventory is currently low (24 units on-hand), and since demand is consistently around 100 units, we need to order to maintain the base stock level. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific high-volume plateau while ignoring the extremely low-demand periods from June. This ensures the OR backend targets the current ~100 unit/week baseline.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Sustained high-demand regime throughout July confirmed; average demand for P22-P25 is 101.5 units compared to June's sub-30 average.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in July. Over the last five periods (P22-P26), demand has been consistently high: 104, 111, 100, 91, and 116 units, averaging 104.4 units per period. This aligns with the 'July demand peak' identified in previous carry-over insights and seems to be extending into August. The inventory at the end of Period 26 is 0, meaning we must order to cover the upcoming demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability and strength of this current high-demand regime, I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific 'peak' behavior while ignoring the lower-volume spring/early summer periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on these last 5 periods ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for this volume, minimizing stockouts like the one seen in Period 26.

Carry-over insight: August demand continues the high-volume regime established in July; average demand for P22-P26 is 104.4 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in July (Period 22). Over the last 6 periods (P22-P27), demand has averaged 107.5 units, with the most recent demand hitting 123. Previous periods (P26, P27) resulted in stockouts (ending on-hand = 0), indicating the OR backend's cap or recent mean estimates are slightly trailing the actual demand surge. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this entire high-demand window (P22-P27), which provides a mean of ~108 and reflects the current volatility. This will increase the base stock level to better cover the recurring 100+ unit weeks and prevent further lost sales during this peak August period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in early July (Period 22). Historically, demand for this 'Ginger Ch hipster' product peaked in March (P5-P7) and is currently seeing an August peak. For the last 7 periods (P22-P28), demand has averaged 106.85 units per week (104, 111, 100, 91, 116, 123, 103). The actual lead time remains 0 periods as confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. Given the high demand and the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the backend should maintain a high service level. I will use the last 7 periods (N=7) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific summer peak regime while filtering out the low-demand spring data.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (cotton hipster briefs) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in July (Period 22). Reviewing the last 8 periods (P22-P29), the demand has been consistently high, averaging approximately 105.75 units per week (detailed: 104, 111, 100, 91, 116, 123, 103, 98), with relatively low volatility compared to the volume. As of early September, there is no evidence of this summer-to-autumn demand tapering off yet. Order arrivals have consistently shown a lead time of 0 periods. Therefore, I will use lead time L=0 (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=8 to capture this specific high-volume regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current ~100+ units/week demand while accounting for the moderate variance observed in this window.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime: August/late-summer demand maintained the high-volume levels of July, averaging 105.75 units across Periods 22-29.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in July (Period 22) and has continued through early September. The average demand from Period 22 to Period 30 is 102.2 units. The most recent demand (Period 30) was 74 units, which is a slight dip but still within the expected range for this regime. Given that the lead time has been consistently 0 periods, I will continue to focus on this high-volume regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture this specific regime (P22-P30) and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the observed volatility. This ensures the OR backend maintains enough stock to cover the ~100 unit/week demand while avoiding overstocking if the late summer peak begins to taper.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in mid-July (Period 22) and has continued through early September. While there is a slight downward trend in the last two weeks (74 and 69 units) compared to the August average (~105), volume remains significant. Total demand for the last 10 periods (P22-P31) averages 98.9 units. I will use recent_N=10 to capture this regime while acknowledging the recent slight softening. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the upcoming period while accounting for the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: September demand (P30-P31) shows a slight deceleration (average 71.5) compared to the July/August average (~100), but remains within the high-volume regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in July (Period 22) and has continued through September. While the peak demand averaged ~105 units/week in July and August, the most recent three weeks (Periods 30-32) have shown a slight deceleration, with demand values of 74, 69, and 53 (average ~65). This indicates a potential transition from the peak summer/late-summer regime to a slightly lower autumn baseline. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To adapt to this deceleration without under-stocking, I will use a recent_N window of 4 (covering Periods 29-32) for both demand mean and volatility. This captures the transition from the ~100 range to the ~65 range, resulting in a mu_hat calculation based on an average of 73.5. This conservative adjustment allows for a reduction in holding costs as demand cools while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the inherent volatility of this product category.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: September demand slowdown confirmed; average demand for P30-P32 is 65.3 units, down from the July/August average of ~105, indicating a tapering of the high-volume summer regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late September/early October period. A significant demand spike occurred in Period 33 (138 units), which is more than double the average of the preceding three weeks (P30-P32 avg: 65.3). This spike suggests a late-September surge, potentially related to end-of-quarter transitions or specific promotions. Inventory is currently at 0 due to the demand exceeding the available stock in Period 33. Given the Lead Time (L) has consistently been 0, I will prepare for a high-demand scenario in Period 34 to avoid further stockouts, while acknowledging the recent volatility. I'll use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the recent acceleration (P30-P33 avg: 83.5) and an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed in the last period (standard deviation between 53 and 138 is high).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Late September demand surge detected; Period 33 demand (138) is more than double the previous 3-week average (65.3), indicating high end-of-month volatility for this SKU.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a high-demand regime that began in July. Recent demand has been volatile: Period 33 spiked to 138, followed by 75 in Period 34. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 81.8 units, which is a deceleration from the July/August average of ~105 but remains significantly higher than the early summer baseline. Date 2019/10/7 suggests we are entering the mid-autumn period; historically (from Feb/March data), this SKU can handle high volumes. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 83 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilization around the ~82 unit level, and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in P33. This ensures the base stock is calculated against the current localized demand average while protecting against recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: October demand baseline observed to be approximately 82 units (P30-P34 average), maintaining the high-volume regime compared to June, though lower than the July/August peak of 105.

Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an October demand regime. While the July/August peak averaged ~105 units, recent weeks show high volatility: P33 (138), P34 (75), and P35 (20). The drop in Period 35 is significant, but likely reflects volatility within the established high-volume regime rather than a total collapse, as the product (hipster briefs) has shown sustained demand since July. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-reacting to the single low data point in Period 35, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the average of the last 5 weeks (approx 73 units) and balance the 138 surge against the 20 dip. This ensures we maintain safety stock (116 on hand currently) against further volatility without over-ordering if demand is naturally cooling into mid-October.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: October demand showing high localized volatility; P35 demand (20) is the lowest since June, despite a surge in P33 (138).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (women's hipster briefs) is currently in a late-October phase where demand has significantly decelerated following a volatile summer and September. Recent demand for Period 35 (20) and Period 36 (7) shows a sharp drop compared to early October and September averages (~82). This pattern mirrors the post-peak stabilization observed in April/May. Since we are in the decision phase for Period 37, we start with 135 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against the high variance seen in previous months (like the surge in P33), I am using the method 'recent_N' for demand parameters. Specifically, N=7 covers the last 7 weeks (P30-P36), which captures both the September high-volume tail and the recent October drop, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 62 units per week. This prevents over-ordering during the current low-demand trough while maintaining a buffer for potential end-of-month spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: October demand deceleration confirmed; average demand for P35-P36 (13.5) is significantly lower than P30-P34 average (~82), suggesting a seasonal transition to a lower-volume baseline similar to Q2.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Womens Lingerie) is currently entering a low-volume demand regime typical after the summer/early autumn peak. Period 37 confirmed a significant deceleration with demand dropping to 3 units, following values of 7 and 20. The current on-hand inventory is 132 units, which is extremely high (covering over 10 periods of the current average demand of ~10 units/week). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods. To avoid further accumulation of holding costs, I am reducing mu_hat and sigma_hat significantly to reflect this lower demand regime. mu_hat is set based on the average of the last 3 periods (approx. 10 units), and sigma_hat reflects the recent volatility within this downward trend. No new orders should be triggered by the OR backend given the current inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: End of high-volume regime confirmed; October demand has averaged 10 units over the last 3 weeks (P35-P37), a 90% decrease from the July/August peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We have clearly exited the high-volume summer/September regime, as confirmed by Carry-Over Insights and the last four weeks of demand (P35-P38: 20, 7, 3, 3). The average demand for the last three weeks is 4.3 units, signaling a return to the low-volume baseline observed in May and June. However, since this is a 'hipster 3-pack' in cotton/lace (staple lingerie), demand could potentially see a slight lift as we enter November/December for holiday shopping, though historical data from February (P1-P3: ~34) suggests the baseline might be slightly higher than the current single-digit values. To avoid excessive holding costs while covering current low demand, I am using a recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent significant deceleration (average of ~8 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. On-hand inventory (129) is more than sufficient to cover multiple weeks of current demand levels, so the OR backend will likely not place a new order regardless of the parameters until stock levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: November demand baseline confirmed as low-volume: Demand for the last 4 weeks (P35-P38) averaged 8.25 units, confirming a full return to the low-demand regime seen in late Q2.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a low-demand regime, with demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) following a significant drop from the summer peak (averaging ~7 units compared to ~105). Specifically, the last three weeks have seen a consistent demand of 3 units per week. This aligns with the seasonal trend observed earlier in Q2. On-hand inventory is currently 126 units, which is extremely high (covering over 10 weeks of even the higher October average and over 40 weeks of the most recent demand). No new orders are needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this low-volume regime and prevent the OR engine from overestimating needs based on the high summer volume. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a confirmed low-demand regime for this SKU (Womens Lingerie hipster briefs), following the summer peak (July-August) and September slowdown. Over the last 6 periods (P35-P40), weekly demand has been 20, 7, 3, 3, 3, and 20, averaging 9.3 units. This is a significant shift from the 100+ units seen in summer. On-hand inventory is currently 106 units, which is more than enough to cover over 10 weeks of current demand at the new baseline. To prevent unnecessary holding costs, I am reducing mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this low-volume regime. I've chosen N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture specifically this post-October stabilization while excluding the high-volatility spike in P33 and P34. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, so I will continue using the default lead time setting.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Multi-week low-volume baseline sustained; average demand for P35-P40 is 9.3 units/week, representing the seasonal 'trough' for this SKU.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Womens Lingerie) has transitioned back into a low-volume demand regime. While Period 41 saw a sudden surge to 135 units, this is highly characteristic of the 'end-of-month' volatility observed in Period 33 (138 units) followed by a sharp drop. Given the 'Carry-over Insights' confirming a low-volume baseline for November (averaging ~9.3 units prior to the spike) and the high holding cost relative to the risk of stockouts in a tapering season, I will use a conservative forecasting approach. I am selecting recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility (including the P41 spike and the low-volume periods P35-40) without over-reacting to what is likely a transitory surge. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Late-November volatility detected; Period 41 demand (135) mirrors the spike seen in Period 33, suggesting periodic 'clearing' demand despite a low-volume seasonal baseline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Ginger Ch hipster cdn 3p) has entered a hyper-volatile demand phase in late November/early December, likely driven by Black Friday and Cyber Monday events. Period 41 demand was 135 and Period 42 demand spiked significantly to 308, causing a total stockout despite an arrival of 107 units. Previous demand patterns in periods 33 and 41 suggest that while the 'baseline' is low (around 10 units), periodic spikes are massive (130-300+). To prevent lost sales during this peak shopping period (early December), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent surge, targeting an inventory position that can handle another high-demand week. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period X conclude' messages, including the most recent one (P42), so L is set to 'calculate'.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Early-December hyper-volatility confirmed; Period 42 demand reached 308 units, a 150% increase over the previous high (138) and 30x the November baseline, coinciding with peak retail season.

This pattern matches the behavior seen in late September (P33-P34) and mid-summer (P22-P23) where high-demand spikes are followed by moderate volatility rather than an immediate return to the absolute baseline. The current on-hand inventory is 328 units. Given the recent average demand of approximately 176 units over the last three weeks (P41-P43), a high target is necessary to avoid stockouts during potential December surges. I will use an explicit forecast of 200 units for mu_hat (covering lead time + review period) to maintain a robust buffer, and a high sigma_hat of 120 to account for the demonstrated standard deviation during peak periods. Lead time (L) remains 0 as confirmed by the Period 43 arrival.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: December peak demand regime is characterized by hyper-volatility. Three-week moving average (P41-P43) is 176.7 units, compared to the November baseline of <10 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing the tail end of the high-volatility holiday peak. Recent demand history shows a massive spike in Period 42 (308 units) followed by a stabilization at 87 units (P43) and 83 units (P44). This suggests the hyper-volatility regime identified in the Carry-over Insights (P44) is still active but potentially cooling down from the extreme peak of late November/early December. We currently have 315 units on hand. Given leading up to Christmas and the end-of-year clearance period, demand remains unpredictable but likely to stay elevated relative to the November baseline (<10 units). L remains 0 based on consistent history. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~153 units) which includes the 308 spike, ensuring we carry enough safety stock but are capped for overstocking. This balancing act uses the OR backend's service level logic to maintain availability without excessive holding costs if the peak has indeed passed.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Early-December hyper-volatility is tapering but remains high; average demand for P42-P44 is 159.3 units, significantly higher than the previous low-volume baseline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak holiday season. Demand in Period 45 was 115 units, following a hyper-volatile December pattern (P42: 308, P43: 87, P44: 83). The average demand over the last four weeks (P42-P45) is 148.25 units. While we have 213 units on-hand, the hyper-volatility (standard deviation of ~108 in the last 4 weeks) and the risk of a final holiday surge before the post-Christmas drop-off suggest we should maintain a robust mu_hat. Promised lead time is 0 and consistently realized as 0. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (N=4 captures the hyper-volatile December regime) and manual explicit sigma_hat to account for the extreme variance seen in P42.

Daily Reward (R_t): $310.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, which is immediately post-holiday. Historical data shows that while December experienced hyper-volatility with peaks of 308 (P42) and significant demand in following weeks (P43-P45: 87, 83, 115), demand in P46 dropped to 32, signaling the start of the post-holiday taper. This pattern aligns with the 'January trough' seen in early 2019 data (P1-P3 demand: 21, 29, 53). Current on-hand inventory is 298 units, which is quite high relative to both the recent tapering demand and the expected baseline. To minimize holding costs while protecting against the remaining holiday-season variance, I am using a recent_N method (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the December volume (~110 avg) but allowing the OR backend to see the high volatility via sigma_hat. The high on-hand stock (298) already exceeds any realistic base_stock calculation for a lead time of 0 periods, so the OR system will effectively stop ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Post-holiday demand taper confirmed. After a December peak (reaching 308 in P42), demand dropped to 32 in P46, indicating a transition back to the low-volume baseline observed in Q1 2019.
