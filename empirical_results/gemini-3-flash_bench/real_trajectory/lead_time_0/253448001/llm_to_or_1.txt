Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11), which is the week of Valentine's Day. The product (Push-up bra) is highly seasonal and expected to see a significant demand spike during this specific week. Historical demand from January/early February averaged 56 units per week (min 39, max 70). Given the context of Valentine's week for women's lingerie, I anticipate demand will exceed the recent historical mean. I will set mu_hat conservatively higher than the recent average to capture this spike, while maintaining a standard L=0. Since this is the first period with no prior order history, I'll use explicit parameters to ensure the OR engine covers the forecasted holiday demand plus safety stock, accounting for the 1-period look-ahead required (L+1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18) for SKU 253448001 (Push-up bra). In Period 1, we ordered 102 units and observed an actual lead time of 0 periods (the promised lead time), as the stock arrived and was used to satisfy a demand of 74. The historical demand samples (51, 39, 58, 70, 62) and the first game period (74) suggest a mean demand of approximately 59 units. However, we are currently in mid-February, shortly after Valentine's Day (Feb 14). Demand in Period 1 (74) was already higher than the historical average, likely driven by this event or local seasonal shopping. Since the peak might be subsiding post-Valentine's, but remains generally higher than early January, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent trend (62 from history + 74 from P1). Lead time is confirmed as 0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a push-up bra, which generally follows steady replenishment demand but can be influenced by seasonal shifts. Looking at historical samples (January to early February), demand ranged from 39 to 70 (avg ~56). In Period 1 (Feb 11) and Period 2 (Feb 18), we saw demand of 74 and 66 respectively, which aligns with the higher end of historical samples and the proximity to Valentine's Day. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, inventory is low (on-hand: 8). I will set the base stock parameters to cover the current demand regime. Since observed lead time is 0, (1+L) = 1. I'll use a recent window (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand levels relative to the full history.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's push-up bra. Historical demand over the last 8 weeks (5 pre-game samples + 3 game periods) shows a mean of approximately 58.75 units per week (51, 39, 58, 70, 62, 74, 66, 40). While Period 3 saw a dip to 40 units, the overall trend remains relatively stable. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders in P1, P2, and P3 arrived within the same period). Given L=0, the target base stock must cover demand for the review period (Period 4) and the lead time. I will use the 'default' calculation for mu_hat and sigma_hat which incorporates all 8 available data points to establish a stable baseline. Since lead time has consistently stayed at 0, the 'default' (promised) lead time is appropriate.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a Push-up bra, a core lingerie product with relatively stable demand. Starting Period 5 (2019/3/11), we have historical demand samples [51, 39, 58, 70, 62] and game history demand [74, 66, 40, 43]. The average demand over these 9 samples is approximately 55.8 units/period, but recent game history shows a slight downward trend in the last two weeks (40, 43). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 4 game periods. Inventory is currently 26 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to weigh the recent lower demand more heavily while still accounting for the earlier higher spikes. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the recent volatility (std dev approx 16.5). Lead time (L) remains 'default' since the promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's push-up bra. Historical demand over the last 10 weeks (5 pre-game samples + 5 game periods) has transitioned from an average of ~56 (Jan/early Feb) to ~39 (last 3 periods). As of March 18, we are in a lower demand regime following the post-New Year/Valentine's peak. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With on-hand inventory at 35 and current demand averaging ~39, we need to maintain inventory levels. I will use N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent lower-volume regime (averaging 39.3) and N=5 for sigma_hat to maintain a stable safety stock buffer. The OR engine will target a base stock covering (L+1)=1 period of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected after Period 2: Average weekly demand decreased from 56.4 to 39.3 (-30%) following the Valentine's period peak.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, following the Valentine's Day peak (Feb 14). Historical demand samples and recent game history confirm a downward trend in demand for this lingerie item. Specifically, demand in the last three periods (P4-P6) averaged 35 units per week, compared to the initial high of 74. The carry-over insight correctly identified this shift. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With current on-hand inventory at 27 and no units in transit, I need to set parameters that maintain a base stock sufficient to cover one period of demand (L=0). Given the stable post-peak demand, I will use a recent_N window of 4 (covering P3-P6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this specifically captures the post-Valentine's stabilization. This ensures the OR backend captures the lower mean (approx 36) and reduced volatility compared to the full history.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Push-up bra', a staple lingerie item. Analyzing historical demand, there was a clear peak around early February (Periods 1-2, coinciding with the lead-up to and during Valentine's Day) where demand averaged ~70. Since then (Periods 3-7), demand has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 36.4 units per period (40, 43, 35, 27, 37). The current date is April 1st, and there are no major upcoming lingerie-specific holidays in the immediate forecast to suggest a significant spike. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Valentine's Day stabilized demand (Periods 3-7). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected lower demand while accounting for the recent moderate volatility (std dev ~6.3). On-hand inventory is currently low (6 units), so the backend should naturally trigger an order to replenish the safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (Date 2019/4/1), demand spiked to 55, which exceeded the total supply (42 on-hand), resulting in 13 units of lost sales and ending on-hand inventory of 0. This spike likely corresponds to the lead-up to Easter (April 21, 2019). The product is a push-up bra, which often sees increased demand during spring fashion cycles and holiday periods. Historically, after the initial high demand in February (weeks 1-2 avg: 70), demand stabilized at a lower mean (weeks 3-7 avg: 36.4). However, the Period 8 jump (55) suggests a new upward trend or seasonal volatility. To ensure we capture this increasing demand and recover from an out-of-stock position, I am using recent_N (N=4) to weight the recent variance and demand more heavily than the full history. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a push-up bra, which saw a peak in demand through January and February (pre-Valentine's day), followed by a lower stable regime. However, demand in Period 8 and 9 (April) surged to 55 and 40 respectively, compared to the mean of ~35 during the Period 3-7 regime. This likely reflects a pre-Easter shopping lift (Easter 2019 was April 21). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is low at 9 units. I will prioritize recent demand data (N=3) to capture this April uptick and ensure enough stock for the final week before Easter.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for this Push-up bra SKU shows relative stability since Period 3, following the post-Valentine's drop noted in Carry-over Insights (Period 6). Since Period 3, the weekly demand has averaged 38.75 units (40, 43, 35, 27, 37, 55, 40, 40). Period 8 saw a spike to 55, which may have been a minor outlier or early Easter effect (April 21, 2019). We are now at Period 11 (April 22), the day after Easter. Demand typically softens slightly after such holidays. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 10 completed cycles. To stay responsive to the post-Valentine/early-spring regime while smoothing the Period 8 spike, I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat (covering Periods 3-10). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to capture the variance of this current stable phase. Lead time remains at the default (0).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' is a microfibre push-up bra. Current inventory is low at 6 units. Analyzing demand history, there was a high demand period in January/early February (average ~56) followed by a post-Valentine's drop. However, since Period 8 (April), demand has stabilized at a higher level than the previous regime (average ~44 units per week across periods 8-11: 55, 40, 40, 41). The date is 2019/4/29, which is just before Mother's Day in many regions (May 12, 2019), likely contributing to this sustained lift. Promised lead time is 0, and historical observations consistently show actual lead time is 0. I am using recent_N=4 to capture this new stabilized demand level (\u03bc \u2248 44) and its associated volatility. This period (lead time 0 + review period) requires covering demand for the immediate next phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 8: Average weekly demand has increased from ~34 (Periods 3-7) to ~44 (+29%) as of late April.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is May 6th. Looking at the history, demand has entered a new regime since Period 8 (April 1st). Demand for the last five periods (Periods 8-12) has been 55, 40, 40, 41, and 55, averaging 46.2 units per week. This is an increase from the previous average of ~34. The product (microfibre push-up bra) may be seeing increased demand leading into the warmer months or Mother's Day (May 12th). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (all orders arrive in the period they are placed). Stocks reached 0 in Period 12, indicating a lost sales opportunity (demand 55 vs 51 available). I will set L to 'calculate' (which has consistently been 0), and mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent higher-demand regime (Avg: 46.2, Std Dev: 7.9) and prevent stockouts.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' (Push-up bra) is currently in a higher demand regime that started around early April (Period 8). In the last 6 periods (Period 8 to 13), the average weekly demand has risen to approximately 46.8 units (55, 40, 40, 41, 55, 50), compared to the earlier post-Valentine's average of ~34. The current date is mid-May, and there are no immediate seasonal holidays for lingerie like Valentine's, but the sustained higher sales suggest a seasonal baseline shift or promotion effect. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 3), following a period where demand (50) nearly exhausted the supply (53). To maintain service levels and prevent lost sales (as seen in P8 and P12), I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this higher demand average (approx 46.8) for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, a recent_N of 6 will likewise capture the current volatility (std dev approx 7.3) while ignoring the much higher variance seen during the Valentine's peak in February.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Period 14 saw a massive demand spike to 113 units, more than double the average of the preceding weeks (~45). This surge aligns exactly with the run-up to Mother's Day (which was May 12, 2019) and the associated retail peak for categories like womens lingerie. While the peak occurred in Period 14, I expect a degree of following-week 'tail' demand or a plateau before returning to the baseline observed in Periods 8-13. Given the zero on-hand inventory and the lost sales in Period 14 (54 sold vs 113 demand), a higher buffer is required to capture current momentum. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 3 periods (approx. 71 units) to bridge the gap between the pre-peak average and the outlier spike, while maintaining a higher sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in May. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed in Period 14 (113 units) likely driven by Mother's Day seasonal peak; volatility increased significantly in May.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' (Push-up bra) is experiencing high volatility. Demand spiked significantly in May (113 in Period 14, 80 in Period 15), likely driven by Mother's Day and the lead-up to early summer. Period 16 (May 27) follows this peak. While demand has slightly receded from the absolute peak of 113, it remains substantially higher than the April average (~44). I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this elevated 'May regime' (average ~81) while forgoing the earlier 2019 data which is no longer representative. Sigma_hat is also set to the recent 3 periods to account for the increased volatility (Std Dev ~31.5 vs long-term ~15). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), so I'll maintain the default L=0.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' is women's lingerie, specifically a push-up bra. We have just passed two major demand drivers: Mother's Day and the surrounding seasonal peak (mid-May). Period 14 (113 units) and Period 15 (80 units) showed high demand, but Period 16 dropped to 63 units, indicating the seasonal surge is cooling off. However, demand remains significantly higher than the April baseline of ~44. Current inventory is 45 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To account for the post-peak stabilization while respecting the recent higher volume, I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand mean and volatility calculation. This window captures the high peak periods (14, 15) and the recent cooling (16), along with two late-April/early-May periods (12, 13), providing a balanced forecast of approximately 70 units per period. This supports a service level that avoids the stockouts seen in Periods 12 and 14 while preventing excessive holding costs as demand potentially returns to mean.

Carry-over insight: Post-Mother's Day seasonal cooling: Demand peaked at 113 (P14) and is trending down (80 in P15, 63 in P16), but remains above the pre-May baseline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak in May (likely Mother's Day), with demand reaching 113 in Period 14 and 80 in Period 15. Since then, demand has cooled significantly, dropping to 63 in Period 16 and 42 in Period 17, returning to the late-April baseline of approximately 44 units. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the post-peak cooling trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5: Periods 13-17) to capture both the tail of the spike and the recent stabilization, totaling approximately 70 units for mu_hat (weighted average of recent high and recent low), which helps the backend compute a base stock that covers the normalized demand while avoiding excessive holding costs now that the seasonal surge has passed.

Carry-over insight: Post-Mother's Day cooling confirmed: Demand normalized to ~42 units in Period 17, matching the pre-May baseline of ~44 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 253448001 (Women's Push-up Bra) shows a clear post-Mother's Day stabilization. After the significant spike in Period 14 (113 units) and cooling in Periods 15-16, demand has perfectly stabilized at 42 units for the last two periods (P17 and P18). This aligns with the 'pre-May' baseline of approximately 44 units identified in previous carry-over insights. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time = 0), I will continue to use L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am selecting N=6 to cover the period from the tail end of the Mother's Day spike through the current stabilization, which captures a realistic transition from peak volatility back to the current baseline. This ensures enough safety stock to handle minor residuals of holiday volatility while preventing over-ordering as demand settles into the summer months.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' (Push-up bra) has stabilized following the Mother's Day seasonal peak in May (Periods 14-16). Demand in the last three periods (P17: 42, P18: 42, P19: 46) is very consistent, averaging 43.3 units. This aligns with the pre-May baseline established in late April. There is no evidence of lost or delayed shipments; Lead Time (L) remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a service level based on recent stability, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the post-peak normalization period. Lead time remains 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period performance.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' is a microfibre push-up bra. Currently, we are at Period 21 (2019/7/1). Demand history shows clear seasonality: a Valentine's peak (P1-P2), a Mother's Day spike (P14-P16), and a relatively stable baseline of approx. 44 units during late April and late June. In Period 20, demand slightly exceeded on-hand inventory (52 vs 46), resulting in a stockout. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, including the most recent conclusion. Given the current date (early July), there are no major immediate retail holidays in the Australian/Global calendar until Father's Day (early September) or end-of-season sales. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P18-P20) to capture the current post-spike baseline (approx. 46.7 units/period) and revert to a calculated lead time to maintain responsiveness.

Carry-over insight: Post-Mother's Day demand stabilized around 46 units (Periods 18-20 average 46.7), slightly above the previous spring baseline of 44.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' (Push-up bra) is currently in a post-Mother's Day stabilization phase, but the last two periods (P20 and P21) have seen an uptick in demand (52 and 65 units respectively), likely due to mid-summer retail trends or seasonal clearance activities beginning in July. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 21, meaning we lost 14 units of demand (65-51). To capture this rising demand while maintaining a service level consistent with a 4:1 profit/holding ratio (80%), I am adjusting the demand forecast. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the shift from the ~45 baseline to the current ~55 average seen over the last month (42, 46, 52, 65). This provides a \u03bc\u0302 of approximately 51 per period. Given the zero lead time, the system needs to order enough to cover the immediate period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptrend detected in late June/early July: Average demand over Periods 20-21 increased to 58.5 units, compared to the previous 4-week average of 44.2 (+32%).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' (Push-up bra) is experiencing an upward demand shift in July. Historical demand for the last three periods (P20-P22) has been 52, 65, and 55, averaging 57.3 units. This is a significant increase from the previous stable range of 42-46 units identified in the June 'carry-over insights'. We are currently in mid-July, and demand remains elevated. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To respond to this higher demand level while considering the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (which suggests roughly an 80% service level target), I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this new summer baseline. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this recent high-volatility window to ensure the safety stock covers the current variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase confirmed in July: Average demand for Periods 20-22 (57.3 units) represents a 25%+ increase over the June baseline of ~45 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' (Push-up bra) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime throughout July. While Period 23 saw a slight dip to 48 units, the average demand for the last four periods (P20-P23) is 55 units, which is a significant increase over the June baseline of ~44 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period). Given profit higher than holding cost (4:1 ratio), the service level (CR) should be high (~0.80). I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current July demand trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as observed lead time is stable at the promised 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 24) showed a significant drop to 29 units, contrasting with the July uptrend previously observed (approx. 57 units/week in Periods 20-22). This suggests the late June/July peak may have been a temporary seasonal event rather than a permanent regime shift. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a larger N=5 for demand and volatility parameters to smooth out the noise from the recent peak and the subsequent drop, grounding the forecast in a broader view of the recent summer window (average of Periods 20-24 is ~50 units). Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (4:1), maintaining a healthy base stock is still preferred to avoid stockouts if demand fluctuates back up.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak subsided in late July: Period 24 demand dropped to 29 units after a 4-week average of 55 units, suggesting the earlier 'uptrend' was a temporary summer peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th. Demand has settled back to a baseline after a temporary summer peak in July. Over the last two periods (P24-P25), demand was 29 and 43 respectively (average 36), which is lower than the July average of ~55 but close to the broader summer baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Mother's Day stabilization while discounting the highly volatile May/early June data. This window includes the July peak and the recent drop, providing a balanced but responsive forecast for mid-August. On-hand inventory is 18, and there are no units in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26 (August 5th), demand spiked to 111 units, which is more than double the average of the preceding baseline (Periods 17-25 average ~46 units). While the product is a push-up bra, which typically sees seasonal peaks in February (Valentine's) and May (Mother's Day), this August spike is significant. It potentially aligns with a late-summer clearance or back-to-university shopping event. Given that we ended with 0 on-hand inventory due to this spike, I must adjust the mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this increased volatility and potential high-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so I will use the 'calculate' method for L. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to weigh the recent spike heavily while still considering the preceding data. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the increased standard deviation caused by the jump from 29/43 to 111 units.

Carry-over insight: Sustained August demand spike: Period 26 demand (111 units) is 2.4x the recent baseline (~46 units), indicating a new high-volatility regime or late-summer peak.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing a significant demand surge in August. Following a period of volatility in July, demand spiked to 111 (Period 26) and 113 (Period 27). This suggests a late-summer peak or a new high-demand regime. Starting on-hand inventory is 0. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the service level is approximately 80%, so the backend naturally targets a base stock that covers demand plus a safety margin. To capture this recent spike while acknowledging it might be a peak, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat (averaging approximately 89 units per period) and sigma_hat (reflecting the high variance between 43 and 113 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained August demand spike confirmed: Periodic demand for P26-P27 (avg 112) is 2.5x the early-summer baseline (~45), indicating a significant seasonal peak or regime shift.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing a significant and sustained August demand spike. Demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) has been 111, 113, and 110 units respectively, which is roughly 2.5x the previous baseline. The 'carry_over_insight' correctly identifies this shift. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this high-demand regime and prevent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus exclusively on this elevated state. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current demand volume (~110-112 units) while accounting for the high volatility observed during such peaks.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448001 (Push-up bra) is currently coming off a significant August peak (average demand for P26-P28 was ~111 units). The most recent observation (Period 29) shows a drop to 68 units, suggesting the late-summer spike is subsiding as we move into September. Historically, demand has specific peaks (Valentine's, Mother's Day, Summer) followed by normalization. Given the drop in P29, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 (capturing the tail end of the spike and the recent drop: 111, 113, 110, 68) to balance between the high August average and the downward trend. Lead time 'L' remains 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0 periods. This approach maintains sufficient stock to cover lingering high demand while being responsive to the observed cooling.

Carry-over insight: September transition: August demand spike (avg ~111) shows signs of subsiding with Period 29 demand dropping to 68 units (-39% from August peak).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent August demand spike (Periods 26-28 saw an average of 111.3) is clearly subsiding as we move into September. Period 29 (68 units) and Period 30 (62 units) show a significant drop but remain above the early-summer baseline (~45 units). Period 31 (Sept 9) follows this cooling trend. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (Periods 28-30) which average approximately 80 units, capturing the transition from the peak to a more moderate level. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility seen during the August spike while reflecting the recent stabilization. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand normalization: Following the August peak (~111 avg), demand has decreased over two consecutive weeks (P29: 68, P30: 62), indicating a transition to a lower-demand post-summer regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear cooling trend following the August peak (avg ~111). Over the last three periods (P29-P31), demand has steadily decreased: 68, 62, and 35. Period 31's demand of 35 aligns with the lower baseline observed earlier in the year (e.g., Periods 3-7). Given the current date is mid-September and the product is a push-up bra, the summer high-demand period appears to have concluded. To avoid excess inventory while maintaining a sufficient service level, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect this recent lower-demand regime. Specifically, using N=3 for mu_hat captures the drop from 68 to 35 (avg ~55), which serves as a conservative forecast for the post-summer transition. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: September demand normalization confirmed: Period 31 demand (35 units) has returned to the spring baseline level (~35-45 units), marking the end of the high-volatility August peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' (Push-up bra) has successfully transitioned from a significant August demand peak (avg ~111 units) back to its baseline. In Period 32, demand was 26 units, continuing a clear downward trend over the last four periods (68, 62, 35, 26). This confirms the September normalization noted in recent insights. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this cooling phase while maintaining a sufficient service level (profit/cost ratio suggests a ~80% service level target), I am using a recent_N strategy for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I've chosen N=4 (Periods 29-32) to capture the current descending regime without the distortion of the August peak, resulting in a more conservative forecast aligned with the observed return to spring/early-summer demand levels.

Carry-over insight: September demand normalization confirmed: Four-week downtrend (P29-P32) shows demand settling at an average of 47.7 units, effectively ending the high-volatility August seasonal peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448001 (Push-up bra) has successfully normalized following the significant August peak (~111 avg). Over the last five periods (P29-P33), we have seen a progressive decline and stabilization in demand units: 68, 62, 35, 26, 41. The current four-week average (P30-P33) is 41.0 units, which aligns with the historical spring/early summer baseline of approximately 40-45 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the high-volatility August regime has clearly ended, I am using a recent_N of 4 to capture this new stable baseline for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents the previous high-demand outliers from artificially inflating inventory levels and incurring unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current demand level.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448001 (Microfibre Push-up Bra) has stabilized following the high-volatility August peak. Since Period 31, demand has been consistently lower: P31=35, P32=26, P33=41, P34=38. The average demand over these last 4 weeks is 35.0 units, which aligns with the spring baseline noted in carry-over insights. October is generally a stable month for lingerie before the holiday season ramp-up in late November. Actual lead time remains consistent with the promised lead time of 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a service level that covers the current demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 4-week window (N=4) to reflect the post-peak normalization.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 253448001 (Push-up bra) is currently in a stable post-summer demand regime. Since Period 31 (early September), weekly demand has normalized around a lower baseline. The average demand for the last five periods (P31-P35) is 33.8 units (35, 26, 41, 38, 29). This is a significant decrease from the August peak (avg ~111) and slightly lower than the spring baseline of ~44. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. Consequently, I am setting L to 'default' (0), and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this specific post-peak stabilization. This ensures the OR backend targets the appropriate safety stock for the current lower-velocity sales environment while minimizing holding costs from excess inventory left over from the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand baseline confirmed: Five-week period (P31-P35) shows stable demand averaging 33.8 units, marking a clear regime shift from the high-volatility August peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019/10/14 (Period 36) was 40 units, which aligns with the stable baseline established since Period 31. The current regime (Periods 31-36) shows a mean demand of approximately 34.8 units (35, 26, 41, 38, 29, 40). With the lead time consistently at 0 periods, the strategy remains defensive to minimize holding costs while covering this current demand level. There are no major retail events in late October for this specific category (Women's Lingerie) that would suggest an immediate spike. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting this stable post-summer baseline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a consistent autumn regime. Over the last 7 periods (P31-P37), demand has averaged 35.0 units with relatively low volatility compared to the summer peaks. The most recent demand (P36: 40, P37: 36) confirms this baseline level. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To optimize the service level (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I will use the recent 7-period regime to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures the current stable baseline while discounting the high-volatility August spike, ensuring we carry enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs during this quieter period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Historical demand for the last 8 periods (P31-P38) has been extremely stable, averaging 34.8 units per week (min 26, max 41). This represents a clear post-summer normalization compared to the August peak of ~111. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this sustained lower-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to reflect the significantly reduced volatility in this period. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as historical arrivals have consistently matched the promised lead time of 0. Current on-hand inventory is 6 units, and there is no inventory in transit. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, which targets a high service level (~80%) suitable for lingerie.

Carry-over insight: Sustained post-summer demand regime confirmed (Periods 31-38): Average demand stabilized at 34.8 units with low volatility, marking a return to the spring baseline.

The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historical data for this Women's Push-up Bra shows a stable post-summer demand regime (Periods 31-39) with an average of approximately 34.8 units per week. While Black Friday (late Nov) and the Christmas season are approaching, the demand hasn't shown a move yet. I will maintain the current baseline forecast for mu_hat using the last 9 periods (regime since P31) to capture the current stability. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the expected 34-35 units of demand with a safety buffer against the moderate volatility observed in this regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical data (Periods 31-40) shows a very stable demand regime following the August peak, with an average of 34.3 units per week. The last four periods (P37-P40) specifically show 36, 34, 31, and 29 units, suggesting a slight but steady cooling as we approach late November. However, we are entering the pre-holiday season. While Black Friday/Cyber Monday (late Nov) might impact lingerie sales, current evidence supports sticking to the established baseline rather than speculating on a spike. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-September stability while excluding the high-volatile August data. This ensures we cover approximately 34-35 units of demand without overstocking, as profit/holding cost ratio (4:1) favors a high service level (~80%).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is the start of the 'Black Friday' and 'Cyber Monday' week, a major holiday shopping period for apparel and lingerie. Historical demand trends show clear seasonal spikes: Valentine's Day (P1-P2), Mother's Day (P14-P15), and a late summer peak (P26-P28). Since Period 31, demand has been stable at a lower baseline averaging ~35 units. However, Period 41 demand increased to 45 units, likely signaling the start of the holiday uplift. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) which implies an 80% service level target, it is critical to capture the upcoming seasonal spike. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 75 units (approximately 2x the recent baseline) to proactively build stock for Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales, and increase sigma_hat to 25 to account for the high volatility typically seen during these peak retail weeks.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Holiday season uptrend suspected. Baseline demand (~35 units) increased to 45 in P41. Black Friday/Cyber Monday expected to drive significant peak demand through December.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a confirmed holiday season uptrend for SKU 253448001 (Women's Lingerie). Period 42 demand was 58 units, following a Period 41 demand of 45, both significantly higher than the previous 8-week baseline of ~35 units. The date is December 2nd, the start of the peak shopping month encompassing Cyber Monday recovery and lead-up to Christmas. Looking at the previous major peak in August (Periods 26-28), demand can reach ~110+ units per week. While recent demand is in the 50-60 range, we must prepare for a significant spike similar to the Mother's Day and August peaks. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend targets a high service level (~80%). I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 110 units (total for review + lead time) to reflect the expected peak December demand and setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent increase in volatility without over-penalizing for the stable October period. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: December holiday peak shift: Demand increased from 45 (P41) to 58 (P42), trending toward the historical peak level of ~110 units observed in previous seasonal surges.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/09). Historical data and recent carry-over insights indicate significant demand volatility and peaks during this time. Period 41 and 42 showed an uptrend (45 and 58 units), though Period 43 saw a temporary dip to 20 units. Based on the August peak (avg ~111) and May peak (113), we must prepare for a possible surge in the final two weeks of December (Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact often lags or spreads in this category). On-hand inventory is healthy at 103 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the target cycle service level is 80%. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the expected holiday peak (~110 units/week) to ensure we don't stock out if demand spikes back to 100+ units, as seen in previous high-demand regimes. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 35 to reflect the high volatility observed during previous peak regimes (August/May). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: December holiday demand volatility confirmed. After an initial uptrend (P41: 45, P42: 58), P43 showed a sharp drop to 20 units, indicating high week-to-week variance during the peak season.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/16). Historical data shows demand surges during this time (similar to August and May peaks), but with high week-to-week volatility (P42: 58, P43: 20, P44: 45). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently high (95 units on hand) following a large order in P42. Given we are approaching the final weeks of the year, I expect demand to remain elevated but highly variable. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current holiday regime (avg ~42) while maintaining a higher sigma_hat (explicitly set to 20 per week) to account for holiday spikes and prevent stockouts during this volatile period, while also being mindful of the high holding cost ($1) and current stock level.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand volatility confirmed: Periods 41-44 show high variance (45, 58, 20, 45) with a mean of 42, reflecting typical end-of-year retail patterns for lingerie.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the Christmas and Year-End holiday season. The product is a push-up bra, which typically sees high demand during the holidays and leading up to Valentine's Day. Recent demand (Periods 41-45) has been volatile (45, 58, 20, 45, 65), showing a general uptrend despite the outlier in Period 43. Period 45 demand was 65 units, and we expect high demand to persist through the final week of December (Period 46) and into the January sales/Valentine's preparation. With 30 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, and a lead time of 0, we must order based on the current high-volatility regime. I will use the recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the holiday regime shift for both mean and variance, which covers the period from late November to mid-December. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the increased average demand and the high seasonal variance, targeting the higher service level justified by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed: Periods 41-45 show an increasing demand trend (avg 46.6) with significant volatility (std dev ~17), peaking at 65 units in P45 as Christmas approaches.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the immediate post-Christmas and pre-New Year period. Historical demand shows a holiday peak (Periods 41-45 avg: 46.6, peaking at 65 in P45 and 71 in P46). However, after Christmas, demand typically drops into a January baseline. Looking back at the very first samples provided (Jan 2019), demand was higher (approx 50-60 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. We ended Period 46 with 0 on-hand inventory because demand (71) exceeded starting inventory + arrivals (62). To maximize profit and cover potential New Year's or January baseline demand, I will set mu_hat based on a recent window (N=6) covering the holiday trend to ensure we aren't under-stocking if the trend persists into early January, while using calculated lead time (0).

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Post-Christmas demand transition. Holiday peak confirmed (P46 demand: 71, P41-P46 avg: 50.6). Transitioning to Jan baseline (historically ~55 units based on P1-P5 samples).
