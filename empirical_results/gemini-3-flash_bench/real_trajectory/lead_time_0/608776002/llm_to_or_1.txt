Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge', which typically sees steady demand but can be influenced by seasonal transitions. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 pre-game historical samples (196, 255, 294, 212, 190), there is a slight fluctuation but no extreme trend yet. The mean demand is 229.4 and standard deviation is approximately 43. Since we have no observation for Period 0 (conclude message), we proceed with the promised lead time of 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most recent behavior from the provided pre-game history, ensuring the base stock level covers the immediate demand (L+1 = 1 period).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 2 (2019/02/18). Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 0 periods was confirmed in Period 1 (ordered 303, arrived 303). The initial demand of 233 is slightly higher than the average of the five pre-game samples (Avg: 229.4), but well within the historical range (190-294). Since there is only one period of game history, I will use all available data (including pre-game samples) to define the demand parameters. mu_hat needs to cover (1+L) periods, so for L=0, it should be the mean of 1 period. The OR backend calculates (1+L) * mean automatically when using 'default' or 'recent_N'. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full sample history, and 'calculate' for L as it confirms the promised 0-day lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge'. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) has been fairly stable, with samples of 196, 255, 294, 212, 190, 233 (P1), and 271 (P2). The mean of these 7 samples is approximately 235.9. The observed lead time for both Period 1 and Period 2 was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture all available data, including the initial warm-up samples and the first two game periods. Setting N=7 focuses on the most relevant recent performance while smoothing out the volatility observed in late January/early February. Since promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time is consistently 0, I will use the default lead time method.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is women's socks, which generally have stable demand but can fluctuate slightly with season transitions. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks including recent periods: 255, 294, 212, 190, 233, 271, 174) show a mean of approximately 232.7 units per week. There is no clear seasonal spike evident yet for early March. The promised lead time is 0, and all three completed periods have confirmed an actual lead time of 0 (arrivals in P1, P2, and P3 matched their order periods). Therefore, I will set L to 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand volatility (174-271 range) while smoothing out the noise from the start of the year.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is Scallop 5p Socks. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) were 196, 255, 294, 212, and 190. In-game demand for Periods 1-4 was 233, 271, 174, and 145. There is a visible downward trend in demand over the last three periods (271 -> 174 -> 145). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all four completed game periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is avoiding stockouts while adjusting to the slowing demand to minimize unnecessary holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent downward trend in both mean and volatility while still acknowledging the higher historical levels.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is 'Scallop 5p Socks'. Historical demand (pre-game) was: 196, 255, 294, 212, 190 (avg ~229). In-game demand (P1-P5) has been: 233, 271, 174, 145, 162. There is a noticeable decline in demand. The mean of the last three periods (P3-P5) is 160.3, compared to the mean of the first two periods (P1-P2) of 252. This suggests a demand regime shift downwards as we move away from the early February peak. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. On-hand at the start of P6 is 138. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand level and volatility, while keeping L at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 3: average demand decreased from ~250 to ~160 (-36%).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear shift starting in Period 3 (Late Feb/Early March). Periods 1-2 averaged ~252 units, while Periods 3-6 have averaged ~156 units (specifically 174, 145, 162, 143). This lower demand level appears sustained as we move further away from winter and early spring. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 6 completed cycles, making 'default' the appropriate method for L. To align the replenishment policy with the current lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 (covering Periods 3 to 6). This will prevent overstocking based on the higher initial demand seen in early February. With 42 units on hand and a lead time of 0, the OR engine will calculate a base stock to cover demand for Period 7 and place an order that arrives this same period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/01. As identified in previous periods, a demand regime shift occurred around Period 3 (~2019/02/25), where the average demand dropped from ~250 units to ~150-160 units. The last five periods (P3-P7) show demands of 174, 145, 162, 143, and 135, respectively. This averages 151.8 units per period, which aligns with the carry-over insight. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, there are 46 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture this lower demand regime. For sigma_hat, N=5 is also used to reflect the stabilized volatility of this new regime. Setting L to 'calculate' handles the consistent 0-period lead time effectively.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is Scallop 5p Socks. The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods consistently (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). In Period 8, we experienced a stockout (demand 182, sold 178, ending inventory 0), indicating the inventory levels were slightly too low for the demand spike. Demand history shows a regime shift from an average of ~250 (pre-Feb 25) to a lower level of ~160 (since Period 3). However, the last two periods (7 and 8) show demand drifting upward again (135, then 182). Given the stockout and the recent increase, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the recent stabilized/rising trend after the drop. This balances the lower average of the new regime with the recent spike. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the recent volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 10 (2019-04-15). Historical analysis shows a significant demand regime shift starting around Period 3. From Period 3 to Period 8, demand averaged approximately 157 units. However, Period 9 saw a sharp drop to 65 units. In the pre-history (Jan 2019), demand was higher (avg ~230). The 'Scallop 5p Socks' product is likely entering a post-Easter or spring lull. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments have arrived within the same period (L=0 confirmed). Because of the recent high volatility (182 units in P8 vs 65 units in P9), I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to prioritize the lower, current regime while maintaining some buffer for the variability seen in early April. I will use N=7 to capture the demand behavior since the first regime shift in Period 3, which provides a balanced view of the 'low' season.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). The SKU (Women's Scallop Socks) shows a significant demand drop over the last two weeks (P9: 65, P10: 59), following a more moderate regime of ~150 units. This decline likely reflects a seasonal transition away from winter-weight or fine-knit socks as temperatures rise in mid-to-late April. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a low-value ($19 profit, $1 holding) but potentially slowing item, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P8-P10) to capture this new downward trend. N=3 is chosen because the drop from ~140-180 down to ~60 is a significant and sustained 2-period signal following a transition point.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: average demand dropped from ~150 to ~62 (-58%), likely due to Spring seasonality for fine-knit socks.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (Fine-knit socks) has experienced two distinct demand drops as the season progressed into Spring. The most recent regime shift occurred at Period 9 (2019/4/08), where demand fell from an average of ~150 to ~59 units. The last three periods (P9-P11) show very consistent demand (65, 59, 54), establishing a new stable low-demand window. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory (163) significantly exceeds the expected demand for the upcoming period (~59-60), the goal is to avoid overstocking and further holding costs while maintaining the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current low-demand regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in a low-demand regime for fine-knit socks, likely due to spring/summer seasonality. Demand since Period 9 has averaged approximately 64 units per period (65, 59, 54, 78). Previous carry-over insights identified a shift at Period 9. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded orders. The on-hand inventory is 85 units, and there are no units in transit. Since the lead time is 0, the backend will target a base stock to cover demand for the current and next period (L+1 = 1). I will use the recent_N method with N=4 to capture the current stable low-demand regime (Periods 9-12). This provides a mu_hat of ~64 for the single period, allowing the OR backend to determine if an order is necessary to maintain the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (Fine-knit socks) is in a low-demand regime characteristic of late spring (May). Looking at the history, a significant drop occurred around Period 9 (2019-04-08), with demand stabilizing at a lower mean. The demand for the last five periods (P9-P13) has been: 65, 59, 54, 78, 52. This translates to a mean of approximately 61.6 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 33, which is below the expected weekly demand. Since the promised lead time is 0 and historical arrivals have consistently mirrored this, I will set L to 'default'. To capture the current seasonal low, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5, covering the period since the drop in early April. Although demand is low, the backend requires sufficient stock to cover at least one week's demand (L=0 means review period target) plus a safety buffer.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product (fine-knit socks) is in a low-demand regime characteristic of late spring. Demand since Period 9 (April 8) has stabilized around an average of 61.5 units per period (65, 59, 54, 78, 52, 61), following the significant drop noted in Carry-over Insights. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 18 units with no units in transit. Since we are in a stable, low-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current phase for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR engine to set a base stock level that reflects the low seasonal demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility in this regime (range 52-78).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (Fine-knit socks) is in a low-demand regime typical for late spring/early summer. Since Period 9 (2019-04-08), demand has stabilized at a much lower level. Observations from Period 9 to 15 show demand values of 65, 59, 54, 78, 52, 61, and 49, averaging approximately 60 units per period. This follows the previous drop from ~160 units (Periods 3-8). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently show a lead time of 0 (same-day arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 28 units, and there is nothing in transit. To maintain availability for the upcoming Period 16 while minimizing holding costs for this low-demand item, I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (the current regime since Period 9) and sigma_hat likewise to capture the localized volatility. N=7 covers the period from 2019-04-08 to the present.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, and the product is fine-knit socks. Since Period 9 (early April), demand has stabilized in a lower regime, averaging 57.5 units per period (Periods 9-16 demand: 65, 59, 54, 78, 52, 61, 49, 38). The most recent demand (38) is at the lower end of this range, suggesting a continued low-demand phase typical for socks during the transition into summer. All historical orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 38 units on-hand with nothing in transit. To set the OR parameters, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the stable demand regime starting from Period 9. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the localized average (approx 57-58) and its associated volatility, allowing the OR backend to maintain an appropriate service level for this current seasonal state while minimizing holding costs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit socks', which are experiencing a seasonal decline as summer approaches. Carry-over insights noted a significant drop in demand around P9 (approx. 62 units/week). In the last five periods (P13-P17), demand has stabilized even lower, averaging approximately 45.8 units/week (52, 61, 49, 38, 29). The downward trend is continuing, with the most recent demand hitting a cycle low of 29 units. To prevent excess inventory and minimize holding costs, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect this recent low-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture this seasonal low while maintaining a safety buffer for occasional spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Seasonality for fine-knit socks continues to decline in summer, with average demand dropping further from ~62 to ~46 units (-25%) between Periods 13-17.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (Fine-knit socks) is in a clear seasonal decline as we move into summer (June). Demand in Period 18 was only 14 units, continuing a downward trend from the regime shift identified at Period 13. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P13-P18) is approximately 40.5 units, but the most recent three periods (P16-P18) average only 27 units, with a noticeable drop to 14 in the last week. Current on-hand inventory is 53 units, which already covers approximately 2-4 weeks of expected demand at the current rate. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (~19:1), the backend OR logic will naturally aim for a high service level, but the parameters need to reflect the current low-demand environment to avoid excessive holding costs on a declining product. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the low-demand regime since the last identified shift, and N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Scallop 5p Socks) is in a low-demand summer phase. Period 20 (late June) demand continues the downward trend noted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand samples (Periods 13-19) are: 52, 61, 49, 38, 29, 14, 25. The mean of the last 7 periods is approximately 38.3, and the mean of the last 3 periods (Periods 17-19) is 22.7. Given the 'Fine-knit socks' description and the mid-summer date, demand is unlikely to recover soon. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-volume regime while smoothing out the extremely low recent week (14 units). This results in a mu_hat of approx 38.3 (since L=0). On-hand inventory is 44, which already exceeds this forecast, so the OR backend will likely place a minimal or zero order, preventing excess holding costs during this off-season.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Fine-knit socks are experiencing a seasonal low during the summer months. Analysis of the demand history reveals a significant and sustained downward regime shift. Period 1-2 averaged ~252 units; Period 3-8 averaged ~157 units; Period 9-12 averaged ~64 units; Period 13-17 averaged ~46 units. The most recent three periods (P18-P20) show a even further decline to an average of ~18 units (14, 25, 14), clearly indicating that the summer seasonal dip is at its trough. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 20 observations. To adapt to this very low demand floor, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs, as on-hand inventory (52) already covers nearly three weeks of the current forecasted demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: Summer trough confirmed with demand dropping further from ~46 to ~18 units (-60%) for the last 3 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019, which is the height of summer. The product is 'Fine-knit socks,' a category that shows clear evidence of negative seasonality during warmer months. Demand has shifted through several descending regimes: from ~250 (Feb) to ~160 (Mar/Apr), then to ~60 (May), then to ~46 (early June), and most recently to ~18 (late June). The last four periods of demand (Periods 18-21) were 14, 25, 14, and 12, averaging 16.25 units per week. This confirms the 'summer trough' noted in previous insights. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. With 40 units on-hand and an average demand of ~16, there is ready inventory for approximately 2.5 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this trough exactly, and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility. This conservative approach prevents overstocking during this low-demand seasonal phase while maintaining a high service level.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, which is the height of summer. Demand for 'Fine-knit socks' has reached a seasonal trough. Historically, demand for this SKU dropped from ~250 in early Spring to ~62 in late Spring, further to ~46 in early Summer, and now sits at a very low level. Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has been: 14, 25, 14, 12, 17, averaging roughly 16.4 units per period. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 23 units, we already cover more than one period of current demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent low-demand regime and prevent overstocking during this slow season, as holding costs would quickly erode profits on such low-volume sales.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit socks', which are experiencing a seasonal summer trough. Demand has been consistently low for the past six periods (Periods 18-23), averaging approximately 16 units per week (14, 25, 14, 12, 17, 14). The Carry-over insight correctly identified a drop at Period 18. Current on-hand inventory is 11 units with zero in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a lean inventory while avoiding stockouts during this low-demand phase, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the recent average of ~16 units (total mu_hat = (1+L)*16 = 16). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to capture current volatility. This approach balances the high service level requirement (profit/holding ratio is 19:1) against the risk of overstocking a seasonal item in its off-peak period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (Fine-knit socks) is in a low-demand summer trough, though recent demand has shown a slight uptick (28 units in Period 24). Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations confirm actual lead time remains 0. Given the low demand period and high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I need to rebuild a small buffer. Demand over the last 7 periods (P18-P24) averaged 17.7 units. However, looking at the last 2 weeks (14, 28), there's a slight recovery. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current trough while acknowledging the latest volatility. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to reflect current low-volume variance. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently been 0.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th (Period 26). The product (fine-knit scallop socks) has passed its seasonal trough observed in June/July (average demand ~18) and is showing a slight upward trend in the last two periods (demands of 28 and 29). This aligns with the beginning of 'Back to School' or pre-autumn shopping for socks. I will transition the demand forecast from the summer regime (N=8) to a more recent window (N=3) to capture this emerging recovery. The lead time consistently remains 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, so the OR backend needs to place an order to meet this trending demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery signaled starting Period 24: average demand increased from ~17 to ~28 (+65%) as summer ends.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (Fine-knit socks) is showing a definitive recovery in demand as we transition from summer to the pre-autumn season (late August). Demand has increased consistently over the last three periods: Period 24 (28 units), Period 25 (29 units), and Period 26 (43 units), compared to the summer trough of ~15 units. We have stock-outs (ending inventory 0) in the last three periods, indicating that demand is actually higher than recorded sales. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the upward trend and account for the unmet demand, I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 (averaging ~33.3 units). However, because we stocked out, this average is likely an underestimation of true demand. Thus, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 45 (slightly above the last observed demand of 43) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the increase in volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Period 24-26 demand averaged ~33.3 units, but persistent stock-outs suggest actual demand is >40 units/period as the summer trough ends.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608776002 (fine-knit socks) is undergoing a significant demand recovery as the summer trough ends and the transition to autumn begins. In Period 27 ending 2019-08-12, demand reached 58 units, which is a clear upward trend from the previous three weeks (28, 29, 43). The last three periods (P25-P27) average 43.3 units, but the most recent observation of 58 suggests the backend 'mu_hat' needs to be more aggressive to prevent stock-outs. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a forecast of 70 units (representing (1+L) * 70) to capture the accelerating momentum and avoid the stock-outs seen in P24-P26. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the recovery phase) to allow for increased volatility during this regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery accelerating: Period 27 demand reached 58 units, confirming a shift from the summer average of ~18 to a new pre-autumn regime of >55 units/week.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (Fine-knit socks) is clearly exiting its summer trough and entering an autumn demand recovery. Demand in Period 27 was 58 and Period 28 was 63. The carry-over insights confirm this upward trend, shifting from a summer average of ~18 to a current regime above 55 units/week. Since the date is August 26, we anticipate further increases as we approach the peak autumn/winter season. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this recovery accurately while avoiding the diluting effect of the summer lows, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the most recent three weeks (Periods 26, 27, 28) where demand was 43, 58, and 63 respectively (Mean ~54.7). This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand level to prevent stock-outs during the transition to autumn.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend confirmed: Last 3 weeks (P26-P28) average demand 54.7, up from summer trough of ~18. Entering autumn season.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Fine-knit socks' is currently entering the autumn season (September 2nd). Historical demand patterns show a clear recovery from the summer trough (Period 18-23: avg ~15 units) to an autumn ramp-up. In the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has been 43, 58, 63, and 40. The slight dip to 40 in Period 29 is viewed as volatility within a rising trend rather than a reversal, especially as we enter peak sock-wearing months. I am setting L=0 as consistently observed. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this autumn recovery phase, which yields an average of 51 units. Given (1+L)=1, mu_hat is 51. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures sufficient stock for the seasonal upturn while acknowledging the high service level requirement (95%) dictated by the Profit-to-Holding-Cost ratio.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (Fine-knit socks) is undergoing a significant seasonal recovery as we enter autumn. In Period 30, demand spiked to 92 units, which exceeded starting inventory (70), resulting in a stock-out. This follows a trend where demand has risen from a summer trough of ~18 units to a recent 4-week average (P27-P30) of 63.25 units. Given the transition into the cooler September month, demand is expected to continue growing towards the early-year levels (P1-P3 averaged ~226). To prevent further stock-outs and capture this growth while maintaining the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit forecast. I estimate mean demand for the coming period at 100 units to account for the upward momentum, with a volatility of 25 (higher than recently observed but necessary for safety stock given the stock-out in Period 30). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Period 30 demand reached 92 units (+130% vs P29); 4-week average (P27-P30) is now 63 units, indicating a return to high-season demand regimes seen in Q1.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks (608776002) is accelerating as we enter the autumn peak season. Demand in Period 30 reached 92 and Period 31 reached 116 units, confirming the autumn surge identified in the carry-over insights. The recent 4-week average (P28-P31) is 77.75, but the last two periods show a clear upward momentum (92, 116). Given this high-growth phase and the transition into mid-September (historically a strong period for this category), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 140 units to capture the anticipated growth and prevent stock-outs, as the inventory has consistently zeroed out or remained low despite increased ordering. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 0. sigma_hat is set to 30 to account for the increased volatility seen during seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand acceleration confirmed: Period 31 demand reached 116 units, following 92 in P30. 2-week average is now 104 units, returning to early Q1 volume levels earlier than expected.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks is continuing its sharp autumn recovery. Following late-summer demand in the 50s, the last three periods (P30-P32) have seen demand consistently high at 92, 116, and 116 units respectively. This confirms a stabilization in a high-demand regime similar to the early Q1 period (avg ~200, though currently tracking slightly lower at ~110-120). The product is highly seasonal, and as we move into late September (P33), we expect this elevated demand to persist or grow towards the peak Q1 levels. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current demand is stable over the last two weeks at 116 units, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this new regime (92, 116, 116; mean ~108) while remaining sensitive to the upward trend. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock sufficient to cover the current 100+ unit/week demand while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed during these seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in Autumn high-season: Last 3 weeks (P30-P32) average demand 108 units, up from 55 in mid-August. Current demand levels now match early Q1 volumes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2489.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand surged to 319 units, which is significantly higher than the stabilized average of ~108 units observed in the preceding three weeks (P30-P32). This looks like a major seasonal peak or promotional event coinciding with the end of September. The product is 'Fine-knit socks', which typically sees high demand in early Autumn/Winter. Because on-hand inventory was completely depleted (ending with 0), there is likely a backlog of demand, and the next few weeks are expected to remain at this high level as we enter October. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new high-demand regime, aiming for a base stock level that covers this elevated volume. Since lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, I will continue using the 'default' lead time method.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Major demand surge confirmed in Period 33 with demand reaching 319 units, a 3x increase over the previous 3-week average of 108. Transitioning to peak Q4 demand levels for fine-knit socks.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks has entered a high-volume Q4 regime, reaching a massive peak of 319 in Period 33 and 272 in Period 34. This matches expected seasonality where demand for hosiery/socks spikes in October as weather cools. The last 2 weeks average demand (P33-P34) is 295.5 units, a significantly higher level than the previous Autumn stabilization of 108. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent stock-outs during this high-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this specific peak regime, as using a longer history would significantly underestimate the stock required for the current peak.

Carry-over insight: Peak Q4 demand regime confirmed starting Period 33: average demand has jumped to ~295 units (+173% vs previous Autumn average of 108).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks has entered a sustained peak Q4 regime. Over the last three periods (P33-P35), demand has been 319, 272, and 315 units, respectively, averaging 302 units per week. This is a dramatic shift from the previous Autumn average of ~108. The 'Carry-over Insights' correctly identified this jump starting in Period 33. Given the current date is mid-October (2019/10/14), this high demand is expected to continue or even intensify towards the holiday season. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To ensure we capture this peak demand and avoid stock-outs seen in P33, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (regime length) and sigma_hat similarly to account for the current high-volume volatility. This will result in a base stock that covers the anticipated 300+ units of demand for the upcoming period, adjusted for the high service level (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019, which is squarely in the peak Q4 demand season for 'Fine-knit socks'. Historical demand analysis shows a major regime shift starting in Period 33. The average demand for the last four periods (P33-P36) is approximately 295.25 units (319, 272, 315, 275). This is a significant increase from the autumn preparation phase (avg ~108). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this sustained peak demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current high-utility period while maintaining the 95% service level required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0).

Carry-over insight: Peak Q4 demand regime for fine-knit socks confirmed (P33-P36 avg: 295 units), returning to or exceeding early Q1 volumes.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (Fine-knit socks) is currently in its peak Q4 demand regime. In Period 37, demand reached 345 units, causing a stock-out (on-hand 0). The demand over the last four periods (P34-P37) has been 272, 315, 275, and 345, averaging 301.75 units. This confirms the previously identified regime of ~295-300 units. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 (as confirmed by every conclusion message in history), I am setting L to explicit 0. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), since lead time is 0, the backend calculates base stock to cover (L+1) i.e. 1 period of demand. I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current high-demand average (~302 units), ensuring the base stock target is high enough to minimize stock-outs during this peak season. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility of this specific regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks continues to surge as we enter November, moving into the peak Q4 season. Period 38 saw a significant jump to 410 units, outstripping the provided order of 360 and resulting in a stock-out. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P33-P38) is approximately 322.7 units, but the last two periods (P37 and P38) show a higher acceleration (avg ~377). Given the persistent stock-outs in P37 and P38, true demand likely exceeds 410. I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the high Q4 regime, while being mindful that the trend is still increasing. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Peak Q4 demand acceleration confirmed: demand reached 410 units in Period 38, exceeding previous average of ~295. Current regime (P33-P38) averages ~323, but last 2 periods suggest actual demand >400.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak demand period for fine-knit socks (mid-November). Recent history shows a established high-demand regime since Period 33, with demand reaching a plateau in the 300-400 unit range. Specifically, the last two weeks (P38 and P39) saw demand of 410 and 365, following a previous average of ~295. To capture this acceleration while accounting for some volatility, I am using a recent_N window (N=7) for mu_hat to average out the peaks and troughs of the Q4 shift (approx. 327 average). For sigma_hat, a larger window (N=7) is used to reflect the high volatility (std dev ~53) observed during this rapid transition. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is in the heart of the Q4 peak demand period for 'fine-knit socks'. Historically, demand has surged from an autumn average of ~108 to a current peak regime (P33-P40) averaging 337 units per week. The last three periods (P38-P40) show even higher intensity with demand values of 410, 365, and 392 (avg: 389). Given we are approaching the end of November (Black Friday/Cyber Monday territory), I expect this high demand to persist or slightly increase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid the stock-outs seen in Period 37 and 38, I will set mu_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime using N=3 to emphasize the >380 units/week volume, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Peak Q4 demand regime for fine-knit socks further intensified: Periods 38-40 average 389 units/week, up from the initial peak regime average of ~323.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is the start of the peak holiday shopping season in the lead-up to December. Demand for 'Fine-knit socks' has shown a clear upward trajectory throughout Q4: Period 38 (410), Period 39 (365), Period 40 (392), and Period 41 (438). The average over the last 4 periods is 401.25 units. Given the seasonality of socks as winter wear and gifts, demand is expected to remain at this intensified peak levels (~400+ units) or grow further as December approaches. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 420 (slightly above the recent 4-week average) to account for this seasonal tailwind and prevent stockouts. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=4 to capture the high volatility seen during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Peak Q4 demand for fine-knit socks has reached its highest sustained level, averaging ~401 units/week over the last 4 periods (P38-P41), up from the initial peak average of ~323.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019, which is the start of the holiday peak season for 'Fine-knit socks'. Period 42 saw a massive demand spike to 682 units, significantly higher than the previous 4-period average of ~401 units. This surge corresponds to Cyber Monday and the start of December holiday shopping. While the OR backend will attempt to capture this, using 'recent_N' with N=4 would still underestimate the new peak (trailing 4-week mean is ~469). To prevent significant stock-outs during the most profitable period of the year ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the Period 42 spike, projecting that demand will remain at this elevated 'Super-Peak' level (approx 700 units) for the next 1-2 weeks before potentially tapering. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by Period 42's arrival.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Super-Peak demand detected starting Period 42: demand spiked to 682 units (+70% vs the previous peak average of ~401) coinciding with Cyber Monday/December holiday shopping.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), we saw a significant demand drop to 280 units after the Cyber Monday spike of 682 units (Period 42). This suggests the 'Super-Peak' was a concentrated event rather than a new sustained regime. However, we are still in the core December holiday season. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P38-P43) is approximately 427 units. Using recent_N=6 captures both the pre-peak intensity and the recent volatility. The current on-hand inventory is 667, which provides a safety buffer against any late-December surges. The backend logic will use L=0, meaning base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat to the average of the last 6 weeks, we align the base stock with the most recent seasonal trend (Q4 peak).

Carry-over insight: Super-Peak demand (682 units in P42) was transient; demand in Period 43 returned to higher-than-average Q4 levels (280 units). The current sustained peak regime (P38-P43) averages ~427 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday shopping period (2019/12/16). Historical analysis shows we transitioned from a 'Peak Q4' regime (averaging ~400 units) to a 'Super-Peak' spike during the Cyber Monday week (Period 42: 682 units). However, the most recent demand (Periods 43 and 44) has retreated back to the high-season average, specifically 280 and 299 units. This indicates the super-peak was transient, and we are now in the stabilized Dec-Jan holiday regime. Given that on-hand inventory is currently high (368 units) following a large corrective order in Period 43, the priority is to avoid overstocking as we exit the peak season, while still maintaining service levels for the remainder of December. I will use recent_N (N=7, covering the start of the Q4 peak in Period 38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand volatility without letting the single Period 42 outlier skew the forecast too aggressively. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Cyber Monday demand (P43-P44) has stabilized at ~290 units/week, returning from the 682 unit spike to standard Q4 peak levels observed prior to December.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-Christmas week. Historically, Period 42 was the 'Super-Peak' (Cyber Monday/Black Friday) with demand at 682. Since then, demand has been volatile but high: 280 (P43), 299 (P44), and a significant spike to 420 in Period 45 (last week). This 420 unit demand likely represents final Christmas shopping for the 'fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge.' Given we are now in the week of Dec 23, demand is expected to remain high through the Christmas/Boxing Day period before dropping in January. The average of the last three periods (P43-P45) is 333 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this post-Cyber-Monday but pre-Christmas surge, effectively forecasting ~333 units for the upcoming period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Christmas peak confirmed: Demand spiked to 420 in P45 (Dec 16) following a two-week post-Cyber-Monday stabilization around 290 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 47 (Dec 30). Historical data for this product ('Fine-knit socks') shows a clear peak season in Q1 and Q4. Demand spiked for Cyber Monday (P42: 682) and then for Christmas (P45: 420; P46: 380). As we move into the first week of January, we anticipate a significant 'post-holiday drop' similar to the pattern seen in early February (Start of history), where demand was around 230-270. However, the last 4 periods average 344 units. To avoid overstocking while the high-season demand tapers off, I will use a recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the most recent post-peak trend, but I expect demand to regress toward the Q1 baseline of ~230. Since promised lead time is consistently 0, I will keep L at default. Sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N=4 to protect against the high volatility seen during the Dec spikes.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand transition: Dec high-peak (avg ~350) moving toward Q1 baseline (avg ~250). Expected demand decrease starting Jan.
