Historically, demand for this item started higher in January (Avg ~122) and has trended downward from mid-February through March (P1-P4 avg: 96.5, P5-P6 avg: 62.5). This decline suggests a post-Valentine's Day lull or a shift in seasonal demand for this specific style. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), making it highly responsive. Current inventory is 139 units with 0 in-transit. Given the recent demand drop (64 and 61 in the last two periods), I will forecast a demand of approximately 65 for Period 7. To maintain a safe but lean inventory buffer of approximately 1.5 to 2 periods of stock (given the 0 lead time and $1 holding cost), I aim for a target inventory of roughly 130-150. Since on-hand is already 139, and forecasted demand is ~65, I will order 56 units to bring start-of-period inventory to approximately 195, which covers the current period and leaves a healthy buffer for the next period, protecting against potential demand spikes or inventory decay while minimizing holding costs.",

This likely marks a late-spring/pre-summer peak. In Period 14, demand was 96 but we only had 60 units available (on-hand + same-period delivery), resulting in 36 lost sales and ending on-hand inventory of 0. Lead time is confirmed consistently at 0 periods. To maximize profit and avoid further stockouts during this high-demand regime, I need to cover the expected demand for Period 15. Given the jump to 96 units and the possibility of sustained high demand as we move closer to summer, I will forecast Period 15 demand at approximately 100 units.

  "rationale": "The product is women's lingerie (Brazilian briefs in lace). We are currently at Period 44 (Dec 9, 2019). Historically, demand for this SKU has been highly volatile with several peaks: Valentine's Day (P1-P4), early summer (P14-P15), mid-to-late summer (P21-P30), and a late-autumn surge (P37-P38). Recent demand has been low (P39-P43 average: 36.4 units), but the date (Dec 9) suggests we are entering the Christmas holiday shopping season. Looking at historical samples provided in the prompt (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04), demand was significantly higher in January/early February (avg ~122) than the current November/early December levels. Given the lead time of 0 periods, I can react quickly to actual spikes. Current on-hand is 73 units. While P43 demand was low (23), I should anticipate a modest holiday increase. I will target an inventory level of ~100 to cover potential demand spikes while minimizing holding costs (which at $1.0 is 25% of profit per unit). Since I have 73 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 27 units.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a women's lingerie item (Brazilian briefs). Historically, demand for this SKU has shown significant volatility around seasonal peaks (February, May, August, October). We are currently in mid-December (Period 45), approaching the Christmas and New Year period. Recent demand (P41-P44) has been low, averaging approximately 33 units per week. However, the pre-holiday period often sees a late surge in apparel/lingerie for gifting or holiday wear. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 61 units. Given the low holding cost ($1) and the potential for a holiday spike similar to previous surges (which reached 100-160 units), it is prudent to increase inventory levels slightly to avoid stockouts if a Christmas surge occurs in P45 or P46. I will order 59 units to bring total available stock to 120 units, providing a buffer against a demand spike while remaining cautious as we approach the end of the game (Period 47).",

  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Charlotte Brazilian Aza.Low 2p', a lace underwear product. Based on historical trends and the current date (Dec 23), we are entering the peak Christmas/Holiday demand week. Period 45 showed a dramatic demand spike to 117 units, up from a previous 4-week average of ~33 units. This confirms a significant holiday surge, likely peaking in P46 (Christmas week) and potentially P47 (post-Christmas sales/New Year prep). With lead_time = 0, I can order just enough to cover immediate demand plus a safety stock for the final period. Given P45 demand was 117, I expect P46 to be similar or slightly higher due to last-minute holiday shopping. On-hand inventory is currently very low (3 units). I will order to ensure a total stock level that covers another high demand week (~120-130 units) and leaves a small buffer for the final game period (P47), while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against potential lost sales profit of $4.0.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Brazilian Aza.Low 2p', a piece of women's lingerie. We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30), entering the post-holiday/New Year's Eve week. Historically, this product shows significant seasonal surges: a February/Valentine's peak (P1-P4 avg ~96), a mid-summer peak (July/August avg ~110), and most recently, a robust holiday peak (P45 demand: 117, P46 demand: 135). Based on the 2018 data provided (notably Jan 7: 114, Jan 14: 133, Jan 21: 148), demand remains very high throughout January, likely driven by post-holiday sales and the lead-up to Valentine's Day. Since lead time is 0 (confirmed by P46 order arriving in P46), and we have only 25 units on-hand against an expected demand exceeding 110-130 units, a large order is required to avoid a stockout while entering the high-demand January regime.
