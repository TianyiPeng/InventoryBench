The OR recommendation is 89 units, which includes a safety stock buffer based on the critical fractile (Profit 19 / [Profit 19 + Holding 1]).

Recent demand (P1-P7) has been stable with a mean of 60.0 units and a standard deviation of 6.6 units. The product description (CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA) and current date (April 1st) suggest stable demand as sports apparel often sees consistent spring interest, but there are no immediate seasonal spikes expected in the next week.\n3.

OR Balancing: The OR recommendation is 62 units. Using recent mean (60) + safety factor for 95% service level (~1.645 * 6.6 = 11), a target stock level of ~71 units is appropriate. Since L=0, current inventory contributes to meeting current demand. Order = Target - OnHand = 71 - 18 = 53 units. However, the OR agent's cap calculation is slightly more conservative. Given the high profit ($19) vs. low holding cost ($1), the critical fractile is very high (0.95), suggesting we should prioritize availability.

Given the recent drop in demand, maintaining a stock level around 85 units is safe but conservative. If demand returns to the long-term average (60-70), 85 units covers the period with a healthy buffer.

The average demand over the last four periods (since the drop) is 38 units. \n3. **Inventory & OR Recommendation**: Current on-hand is 34 units. The OR recommendation of 50 units is based on a base-stock level calculated from the entire history.

The OR recommendation is 46 units, based on a calculated base-stock level that weighs the entire history. Given the L=0 lead time, we only need to cover the current period's demand. If demand is ~40-50 units, 46 units plus 37 units on hand (total 83) is very safe (almost double the expected demand).\n4. **Final Strategy**: I will follow the OR recommendation of 46 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product 'CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA' is experiencing a significant holiday demand surge. Historical data for December shows demand spikes to 123 (P42), 211 (P45), and 185 (P46). The current date is December 30th (P47), which is the final period of the holiday peak/New Year's resolution period for sports apparel. In Period 46, demand was 185. In Period 45, it was 211. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 35. The OR recommendation of 77 units is based on overall historical averages and is significantly too low for the current high-demand regime. I will override the OR recommendation to ensure we can meet a projected demand of approximately 180-200 units. To reach a safe stock level of ~200 units including the 35 on-hand, I need to order roughly 165 units. This covers the potential for another high-volume week as customers buy sports gear for New Year's resolutions.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR recommendation from 77 to 165 units to meet sustained holiday/New Year demand surge (recent demand 185-211 units).",
