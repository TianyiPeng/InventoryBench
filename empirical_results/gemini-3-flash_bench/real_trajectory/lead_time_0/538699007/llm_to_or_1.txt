Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The project is a 'V-neck strap top' (Everyday Basic). Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a steady increase: 46, 56, 43, 44, and most recently 76 (on Feb 4th). The jump to 76 suggests a potential early spring ramp-up or a promotional effect. Promised lead time is 0. Since we have no inventory on-hand or in-transit, we need to order immediately. I will use the recent demand trend to set mu_hat. Given the last 5 weeks of data, the mean is 53. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the demand for 1 period (L+1). I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this recent average while acknowledging the latest spike without overreacting wildly. Sigma will also be derived from this recent window to account for the increased volatility seen in the last data point.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck top. Historical data from Jan ('2019-01-07' to '2019-02-04') shows a mean demand of ~53 units. However, in Period 1 (last week), actual demand jumped to 135 units, significantly higher than the training samples. This suggests a potential structural shift or a seasonal spike as we move further into February. The promised lead time is 0, and the Period 1 conclusion confirms an actual lead time of 0 (ordered 53, arrived 53). Because we started with 0 inventory and only ordered 53 in Period 1 (based on initial statistics), we stocked out (satisfied 53 demand, lost 82). To recover and capture this higher demand, I will use hisotrical mean plus a buffer or focus on the most recent jump. Since we only have one period of high demand (135), using a strict 'recent_N' might overreact, but we must protect against a repeat. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to aim for a forecast that balances the recent spike (135) with the historical average (~53), targeting approximately 100 units to avoid excessive holding costs if P1 was an outlier, while acknowledging the stockout risk.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck strap top. We are in Period 3 (late February). Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) were 46, 56, 43, 44, 76. However, in Period 1 and 2, the actual demand spiked significantly to 135 and 149 respectively, likely due to pre-spring shopping or a local seasonal shift. On-hand inventory has been depleted to zero in both periods (sold=arrived), indicating we are under-ordering. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, but lost sales are costly in terms of missed profit. The promised lead time is 0 and has been consistent. To address the clear demand regime shift from an average ~53 to ~140, I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture the current high-demand period for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using a small N is necessary because the last two periods represent a distinct surge compared to the historical seed data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 11 (Period 1): Average weekly demand increased from ~53 to ~142 (+168%) over the last 2 weeks.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P1: 135, P2: 149, P3: 108) indicates a clear regime shift compared to the pre-game history (mean ~53). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 131 units. The item is a 'V-neck strap top', which is likely entering peak seasonality as we move into March. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while excluding the much lower historical data. Setting L to default (0) maintains the 1-period planning horizon (L+1=1) required to cover current period demand. The current on-hand inventory is 34 units, so the backend will aim to reach a base stock level around 131 + safety stock, resulting in an order of approximately 100-110 units.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's V-neck strap top (Everyday Basics). Historically (pre-Period 1), demand was low (avg ~53). Starting Period 1 (Feb 11), a demand regime shift occurred with a significant spike (135, 149), likely due to early spring seasonality for basics. Over the last 4 periods (P1-P4), the average demand has been 120.75. However, there is a clear downward trend in the last two weeks (108, 91), suggesting the initial peak is stabilizing or returning towards a slightly lower 'new normal' as the initial surge subsides. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend logic (q=0.5) targets a 50% service level, essentially ordering to the median. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher regime while allowing the recent softening in demand to temper the forecast. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. The product is a women's V-neck strap top. Historically, demand spiked in mid-February (Periods 1 & 2) with values of 135 and 149, likely due to early spring shopping or a specific promotion. However, since Period 3, demand has steadily declined (108, 91, 72). The carry_over_insight from Period 3 correctly identified the initial spike, but we are now seeing a mean-reverting or cooling trend as we move further into March. The mean of the last 5 periods (the recent regime) is approximately 111. Given the declining trend, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the average of this higher-demand phase while acknowledging the current downward trajectory. Lead time is consistently 0. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 and sigma_hat with recent_N=5 will provide a base stock calculation that balances against the current on-hand inventory (49) while protecting against any volatility that remains from the February surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed: After the mid-February spike (avg ~142), demand has declined for 3 consecutive weeks (108, 91, 72), suggesting the initial surge was transitory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand spiked to 124, reversing the cooling trend seen previously (108, 91, 72). This sudden increase, combined with current inventory being zero, suggests the 'Womens Everyday Basics' top is experiencing a resurgence, possibly due to spring seasonality as we reach late March. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while being mindful of the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (which implies a 50% target service level), I will adjust mu_hat using recent data. I'll use N=4 to capture the recent volatility and the latest spike (averaging demand from Period 3-6: 108, 91, 72, 124 = 98.75). Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect demand for (L+1)=1 period. I will set mu_hat to 100 to account for this recent bounce.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: After a 3-week decline, demand spiked by 72% in Period 6 (from 72 back to 124).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is showing a strong upward trend in demand as it transitions into the spring/summer season (April 1st start date). Demand in the last two periods (124, 169) has significantly exceeded the previous 'cooling' phase. We have stocked out for two consecutive periods, losing significant potential profit because the OR backend's cap or existing mu/sigma parameters are too low for this seasonal trend. Actual lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat (target 180) and sigma_hat (increased to 45) to force a higher base stock and cap, ensuring we capture the rising seasonal demand and recover from zero on-hand inventory. Setting L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal surge confirmed: Demand has increased from an average of ~90 in early March to 146.5 in late March. Two consecutive stockouts (Period 6 & 7) indicate current parameters are undertracking this seasonal shift.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is entering April, a peak period for women's everyday basics as spring weather takes hold. We have experienced four consecutive periods of stockouts (Periods 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8), showing that the OR backend's standard calculations are consistently trailing the upward demand trend. Most importantly, demand has surged from 72 (Period 5) to 124, 169, and finally 227 in the current period\u2014a growth of nearly 215% in four weeks. Current on-hand is 0. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this clear seasonal acceleration, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 260 to anticipate continued growth, and sigma_hat to 60 to protect against the high volatility observed during this climb.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand acceleration confirmed: Demand has increased for four consecutive weeks (72 to 227), averaging 173 units over the last 3 weeks. Inventory has stocked out in 5 of the 8 recorded periods due to this rapid growth.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck strap top', which is highly seasonal as we move into spring and summer. Period 10 (April 15) is in the middle of the spring seasonal ramp-up. We have seen a significant upward trend in demand: 124, 169, 227 (with stockouts), followed by 163 in Period 9. The average demand over the last 4 periods is 170.75. However, since we stocked out in Periods 6, 7, and 8, the actual demand was likely higher than the recorded sales. The drop from 227 to 163 suggests volatility or a temporary stabilization, but given the 'Jersey Basic' nature of the product and the warming weather, we must maintain a high service level. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio of 0.5 (z=0), where the base stock target is the mean. However, to compensate for frequent stockouts and the seasonal trend, I will use recent_N for both mean and volatility to capture the high-demand regime of the last month. I will set N=4 to cover the most recent seasonal behavior (mid-March to mid-April). Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's V-neck strap top (Everyday Basics), which is strongly seasonal as weather warms. Historically, demand for pre-February samples averaged around 52 units. From Period 1 (Feb 11) to Period 8 (April 1), demand surged significantly, peaking at 227 units. However, current data suggests a cooldown or stabilization phase: demand has dropped from 227 (P8) to 163 (P9) and then 136 (P10). This downward trend indicates the extreme seasonal peak may have passed, but demand remains substantially higher than the baseline. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.5 critical ratio), the OR engine needs to balance against the recent volatility. Using N=3 for demand (mu_hat) captures the recent deceleration (averaging ~175) to avoid overstocking while acknowledging current volume. For sigma_hat, using N=5 (capturing the peak and the drop) ensures enough safety stock to cover the high variance observed during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: After reaching a seasonal high of 227 in Period 8, demand has decreased for two consecutive weeks (163, 136), suggesting a stabilization period following the spring surge.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck strap top, which is highly seasonal as the weather warms. Following the spring surge in Period 8 (demand 227), demand has shown signs of stabilizing over the last three periods (163, 136, 136). The average demand over these last three periods is exactly 145 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as promised. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will set mu_hat to 145 using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the post-peak stabilization. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 as well to reflect the lower volatility during this stabilization phase compared to the high-growth phase in early April.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: After the late-March peak, demand has held steady at an average of 145 units for three consecutive periods (Periods 9-11), down from the peak of 227.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'V-neck strap top', a part of 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Currently entering May (Period 13, 2019/5/6). Historically, demand spiked through March and early April (reaching 227) but has since stabilized as noted in Carry-over Insights for Periods 11 and 12. For the last four consecutive periods (Periods 9-12), demand has been 163, 136, 136, and 131 units respectively, showing a clear stabilization around a mean of ~141.5 units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 12 demand was 131 and we finished with 14 on-hand, we need to maintain a base stock that covers This level of demand. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this stable post-peak regime (avg ~142). Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility since the April peak. This approach ensures the OR backend targets the current stabilized demand level rather than the extreme peak or the earlier year-to-date average.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck strap top) is exiting its peak spring season (March/April). Historical demand reached a high of 227 in Period 8 and has since followed a cooling trend: 163, 136, 136, 131, and now 97 in Period 13. The last 5 periods average ~127 units, but the most recent figure (97) suggests a step down into a late-spring/early-summer baseline. The product on-hand inventory is 45 units. Given equal profit and holding costs ($1.0), the backend OR engine targets a 50% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this stabilization/cooling trend while maintaining enough coverage to prevent stockouts if demand plateaus near 100. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-spring peak decline confirmed: Following a peak of 227 (Period 8), demand has trended downward, reaching a new low of 97 in Period 13, settling at an average of ~127 over the last 5 weeks.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's V-neck strap top, a quintessential summer basic. We are currently in late May (Period 15). Analysis of historical demand shows a clear peak in early April (227 units) followed by a stabilization and gradual decline. Demand over the last five periods (Periods 10-14) has been 136, 136, 131, 97, and 113. This yields a recent 5-period average of approximately 123 units per week. While the 'Post-spring peak decline' was noted in the carry-over insights, the most recent demand (113) shows a slight uptick from the previous low (97), suggesting demand is leveling off at a seasonal baseline rather than continuing to plummet. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (122.6 units) and sigma_hat to reflect this current post-peak stability, which balances the risk of overstocking against the holding cost, which is equal to the profit margin ($1.00).

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized following the spring peak, averaging ~123 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 10-14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is currently in a stable demand phase following a spring peak in April. Over the last five periods (Periods 11-15), demand has averaged approximately 122.8 units (136, 131, 97, 113, 137). The most recent period (P15) saw a slight uptick to 137 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This indicates that demand remains robust as we enter late May. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0. Given the current date of May 27th, we are moving towards early summer where demand for 'Jersey Basic' vest tops typically remains high or steady. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this post-peak stability while slightly reacting to the most recent stockout, and sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect current volatility. This configuration aims to maintain high service levels (q=0.5 but capped policy provides safety) and prevent stockouts seen in Period 15.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (Womens V-neck strap top) is experiencing a late-spring/early-summer demand uptick. After stabilizing around 123 units (Periods 10-14), demand has risen for two consecutive weeks (137 in Period 15, 157 in Period 16), resulting in stockouts in both periods. The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 136 units, but with the specific upward trend and recent stockouts, a more responsive forecast is needed. I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture this immediate rise while the system still experiences zero lead time. The profit-to-holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, but because we are currently stocking out (missing demand), I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the volatility from the last several periods without being overly penalized by the earlier seasonal peak in April. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand resurgence detected starting May 20 (Period 15): Demand has increased for two consecutive weeks (137, 157) from a prior 5-week average of ~123, leading to back-to-back stockouts.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10, entering the peak of the summer season for 'V-neck strap top'. Period 17 demand (109) was a slight cooling after two weeks of growth (137, 157) and back-to-back stockouts. However, the early summer resurgence remains the dominant trend compared to the May average of ~123. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts during what is likely a high-demand period for this product type (jersey basic vest top), I will keep mu_hat aligned with the recent 3-period average (~134) to capture the upward summer drift while being slightly conservative due to the Period 17 dip. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility (std ~24) observed over the same recent 3-period regime to maintain a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand resurgence confirmed: Mid-May to early June shows a higher demand level (avg ~134) compared to the early May average (~115), despite a slight dip in the most recent period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'V-neck strap top', a summer staple. Historically, demand peaked in April (Period 8: 227 units) and has since stabilized with some volatility. Periods 15 and 16 saw higher demand (137, 157) resulting in stockouts, but demand has dropped significantly in the most recent two periods (Period 17: 109, Period 18: 83). This drop likely reflects a temporary cooling before potential late-June heatwave spikes. On-hand inventory is currently 52 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1 (suggesting a target service level of 50% for a single-period model, though the OR backend uses a capped policy), I will set parameters to cover a moderate demand level. The recent 4-period mean is approx 121.5 units ((137+157+109+83)/4). Setting N=4 for mu_hat captures this recent range, while sigma_hat is set to N=8 to better account for the volatility seen throughout the spring/summer transition. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-June demand drop: Demand decreased for two consecutive weeks (109, 83) from a late-May average of ~147, reflecting high sensitivity to immediate weather/seasonal fluctuations.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has entered a significant downward trend over the last three weeks, falling from 109 to 74 units (averaging ~89 units), which is the lowest level since early March. This follows a brief early-summer spike in late May. The product (a V-neck strap/vest top) is highly seasonal, and the current cooling suggests that the initial summer purchasing surge has subsided. With the profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR engine should aim for the median demand. To reflect this recent decline and avoid overstocking (excessive holding costs), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4), covering the descent from 109 to 74. Lead time remains consistently at 0 based on history.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand decline confirmed: Demand has dropped for three consecutive weeks (109, 83, 74) from a late-May peak, reaching its lowest level since Period 5.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is July 1, 2019. Historical demand for this 'V-neck strap top' shows a significant seasonal peak in late March/early April (up to 227 units), followed by a general decline as summer progresses. Recently, demand has dropped for four consecutive weeks (109, 83, 74, 59), confirming a mid-summer downward trend. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. The product's profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. Given the clear downward trajectory and the 'Everyday Basics' categorization, I am setting mu_hat using a recent window to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining sigma_hat on a slightly longer window to protect against the high volatility observed in previous seasonal shifts. This approach aims to reduce ending inventory (minimizing holding costs) while remaining responsive to any sudden stabilizing of demand.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand decline sustained: Demand has dropped for four consecutive weeks (109, 83, 74, 59), reaching levels comparable to the start of the year (approx. 50-60 units).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 538699007 (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck top) has entered a clear mid-summer trough. Since the late May peak, demand has declined for five consecutive weeks: 157, 109, 83, 74, 59, and now 54. The current demand level (mid-50s) matches the levels observed at the very start of the year (initial samples were 46, 56, 43, 44, 76). To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (Periods 17-21: 109, 83, 74, 59, 54), which captures the downward trend while reflecting the current stabilization around 50-60 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough confirmed: Demand has declined for five consecutive weeks (109, 83, 74, 59, 54), stabilizing at levels (approx. 55 units) similar to early January.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (Womens Everyday Basics Vest top) is experiencing a continued decline as it moves deeper into the summer season. Demand has dropped for six consecutive weeks (109, 83, 74, 59, 54, 29), with the most recent demand (29) falling significantly below the previous troughs of ~50. This suggest the 'summer trough' noted in Period 22 is deeper than initially anticipated. On-hand inventory is currently 47 units, which is already higher than the most recent weekly demand. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current low-demand regime (avg ~43) while allowing the OR backend to adjust for the recent sharp drop to 29. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand decline has accelerated: demand dropped from ~55 to 29 in Period 22, representing a 46% decrease from the previous two-week floor.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck top) is currently in a significant mid-summer demand trough. Demand has decreased steadily from its spring peak and has recently hit very low levels (29 and 34 units in the last two periods). This aligns with the 'Jersey Basic' category behavior where initial seasonal replenishment needs have passed. Analysis: Period 23 demand was 34, Period 22 was 29, and the preceding floor was around 54-59. The current average of the last 4 periods is approximately 44 units. However, given the sharp drop to ~30 units levels, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the downward trend while providing some safety buffer. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The goal is to minimize holding costs as demand reaches its bottom, while maintaining enough stock to cover the ~$30-40 baseline demand.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough sustained: Demand has averaged ~30-35 units over the last 2 periods, marking the lowest activity level since early Jan/Feb.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Women's Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck top) is in a clear mid-summer demand trough. Demand has decreased significantly from its spring/early-summer levels, stabilizing at a much lower floor. The most recent demand samples are 29, 34, and 24, averaging 29 units over the last 3 periods. This aligns with the 'Mid-summer demand trough sustained' insight. In Period 24, the ending inventory was 20, and the demand was 24, indicating the system is now well-calibrated to this lower demand. I will use a 3-period window (recent_N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime and prevent over-ordering as we move through late July. Lead time remains consistently 0, so I will continue using 'default'.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck strap top) is currently in a deep mid-summer demand trough. Demand has decreased steadily from a seasonal peak of 227 in Period 8 down to 15 in the most recent period (Period 25). The last three weeks of demand (24, 15) indicate a significant slowdown as the summer season progresses towards August. With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should align closely with the median expected demand. Current on-hand inventory is 14 units, which nearly covers the last observed demand of 15. To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer for potential minor fluctuations, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to capture the current low-demand floor (averaging ~24 units per period). Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough reached a new low: Demand in Period 25 dropped to 15 units, continuing a 9-week downward trend from the late-May peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the V-neck strap top (Everyday Basics) has consistently declined since the summer peak in May, reaching a trough in late July/early August. The most recent demand samples are 15 (Period 25) and 13 (Period 26), confirming a stabilization at this lower baseline. Current on-hand inventory is 13 units, which matches the most recent demand. To avoid overstocking while moving toward the end of the summer season (August 12), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this floor of approximately 14-17 units. This ensures we don't over-order based on the much higher historical year-to-date average, while maintaining a lean position for this basic jersey item. Lead time is reliably 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a low baseline of ~13-15 units over the last two periods (Period 25-26), down from the spring peak of 227.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The product is a summer-staple vest top. Demand for this item peaked in late spring (Period 8, April) and has been in a sustained decline throughout the summer, hitting a trough in late July/early August with demand as low as 13-15 units. However, Period 27 showed a slight uptick to 20 units, resulting in a minor stockout because the previous order was very conservative. While we are in the late summer 'trough' phase, we must provide enough stock to cover this baseline demand of approximately 15-20 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current low-demand regime (averaging ~18 units) while reacting to the slight increase in Period 27.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic Vest Top' (a summer-centric product) is beginning to show a subtle reversal from its long-term mid-summer decline. After reaching a trough of ~13-15 units (Periods 25-26), demand has increased for two consecutive periods to 20 and 25 units. While still low compared to the spring peak, this represents a potential late-summer or back-to-school stabilization/slight uptick. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I am shifting to a 'recent_N' method with N=5 (Periods 24-28) to capture this recent upward movement while discounting the significantly higher demand from early summer. This setting will allow the OR backend to adjust to the current baseline of ~20 units plus a safety margin, preventing the stockouts observed in the last two periods where demand slightly exceeded current inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand stabilization/slight uptick: After hitting a trough of ~14 units (Periods 25-26), demand has risen for two weeks (20, 25), indicating a move away from the seasonal floor.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' vest top. Demand has recently stabilized at a low seasonal floor following a long mid-summer decline. After hitting a trough of ~13-15 units in late July/early August (Periods 25-26), demand showed a slight uptick to 20 and 25 units before falling back to 16 in Period 29. The current average over the last 4 periods (Periods 26-29) is 18.5 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. With on-hand inventory at 4 units and no in-transit stock, I will set mu_hat using a recent window of N=4 to capture this low-volume floor while allowing for the recent slight variance observed in the late-summer 'uptick' phase. This ensures we cover the current demand regime without over-stocking as we exit the peak summer season.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand floor confirmed: Following the mid-summer trough of ~14 units (Periods 25-26), demand has averaged 18.5 units over the last 4 periods (Periods 26-29), indicating a stable but low-volume baseline for early September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's v-neck strap top (Everyday Basics), which experienced a massive spring/summer demand peak and has since settled into a low-volume late-summer/early-autumn baseline. Recent demand has stabilized around ~18 units (Periods 27-30: 20, 25, 16, 19). The promised lead time of 0 consistently matches actual delivery history. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, though the OR backend's inventory cap policy typically provides additional safety. Given the very stable low-demand regime observed over the last 4-5 weeks, I will use a recent window of N=5 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current baseline while filtering out the volatile historical summer peaks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's v-neck strap top (Everyday Basics), which peaked in Period 8 (April) and has since trended downwards through summer. Current demand is in a stable low-volume regime. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 27-31), demand has averaged 20.8 units (20, 25, 16, 19, 24). There was a slight uptick from the seasonal trough (~14 units), but it remains far below the spring peaks. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this current baseline of ~21 units per week. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. Given the high stockout frequency in recent periods (ending on-hand 0 in Periods 27, 28, 30, 31), I am setting mu_hat slightly above the historical average to ensure we capture the demand peaks within the current 20-25 unit range. The profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a 50% service level target (z=0), so keeping inventory close to the expected mean is optimal to minimize holding costs while meeting base demand.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand has stabilized at a new baseline of approximately 21 units (average of Periods 27-31).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is a women's jersey v-neck top (SKU 538699007). Demand has transitioned from a mid-summer trough (~15 units) to a stabilized late-summer/early-autumn baseline. Over the last 6 periods (Periods 27-32), demand has averaged 18.5 units. The most recent period saw a significant drop to 7 units, which may be a weekly fluctuation or the start of a further seasonal decline as autumn progresses. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, making the backend's base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) very sensitive to the mean. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the current stable baseline (avg ~18.5) while smoothing out the most recent outlier (7). Observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed: Demand has averaged 18.5 units over the last 6 periods (Periods 27-32), following the summer trough.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Top) is in a stable post-summer demand regime. Since late July (Period 25), demand has remained consistently low, averaging approximately 18 units per week. The most recent demand (Period 33) was 18, which aligns perfectly with the 6-period average identified in the Carry-over Insights. Lead time is reliably 0. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (covering Periods 27-33) to capture this stable baseline while ignoring the higher volatility of the mid-summer peak. I will use recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to provide a conservative buffer against the slight variability (7 to 25 units) observed in this floor regime. This ensures optimal service level without excessive holding costs for a low-margin basic.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand floor sustained: Demand has averaged 18.1 units over the last 7 periods (Periods 27-33), indicating a consistent autumn baseline for this basic item.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck strap top) is currently in a stable low-demand phase characteristic of the autumn season. Demand has remained consistently low since early August (Period 25). Over the last 10 periods (Periods 25-34), the average demand is 16.5 units, with the most recent sample at 8 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent unnecessary holding costs for this basic item while maintaining availability, I will use a recent window (N=10) for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this low-volume autumn baseline. This reflects the most recent stable regime after the summer trough and subsequent minor stabilization.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' vest top, which has transitioned from its summer peak and post-summer floor into a stable autumn baseline. In the most recent period (Period 35, Date: 2019/10/07), demand was 15 units. Over the last five periods (Periods 31-35), demand has been 24, 7, 18, 8, and 15, yielding an average of 14.4 units. The observed lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the stability of the demand at this low volume and the continued reliability of the 0-period lead time, I will set L to 'default' (0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand regime and its volatility while filtering out the higher volume historical noise from earlier seasons.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand baseline confirmed: Average demand has settled at approximately 14 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 31-35), continuing the trend of low-volume stability following the summer trough.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product (V-neck strap top) is a 'jersey basic' in 'Womens Everyday Basics', which typically shows high demand during spring/summer and lower baseline demand in autumn/winter. This pattern is confirmed by the historical data: a spring peak of 227 units (Period 8) followed by a gradual decline to a current autumn baseline. In the last 5 periods (Periods 32-36), demand has been 7, 18, 8, 15, and 14, averaging 12.4 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking during this low-demand baseline and to account for the most recent regime shift (autumn stability), I will use the recent_N method based on the last 5 periods (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set the base stock level relative to the recent low-volume but stable demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Demand for this 'Jersey Basic' top is currently in an autumn baseline phase. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 33-37), demand has averaged 15.4 units (18, 8, 15, 14, 22). While Period 37 saw a slight increase to 22, the overall trend remains low-volume stability following the summer trough. With Profit and Holding Cost both at $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the optimal base stock should target the median demand (z=0). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current baseline variance and mean while remaining responsive to the minor fluctuations seen in late October.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019 (Period 39). The SKU is a 'V-neck strap top', an everyday basic item. Demand has remained consistently low since the post-summer decline. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 34-38), demand has been 8, 15, 14, 22, and 15, averaging 14.8 units per week. This aligns with the 'autumn demand baseline' mentioned in the carry-over insights. Historically, the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime as we approach late autumn. Setting L to default (0) as there have been no observed delays.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck top. This category recently moved from a summer peak (Period 8/9: ~200 units) to a much lower, stable autumn baseline. Over the last 10 periods (Periods 30-39), demand has averaged approximately 15.1 units, with recent fluctuations between 9 and 22. The most recent period (Period 39) saw a demand of 9 units. There is no evidence of a lead-time shift, as all orders since Period 1 have consistently arrived with a lead_time of 0. Given the stability of this autumn regime, I will use a window of 10 periods (N=10) to calculate the mean and standard deviation, which captures the current low-volume baseline while filtering out the volatile spring/summer data. This will provide a lean inventory level suited for 'everyday basics' during a low-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~15 units (Periods 30-39) following the late-summer trough, indicating a consistent baseline for the 'Basics' category in Q4.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is a V-neck strap top, classified as 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Demand has remained extremely stable throughout the autumn months (September-November), with an average demand of approximately 14-15 units. Specifically, over the last 10 periods (Periods 31-40), the average demand is 14.5 units with low volatility, despite small fluctuations. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Given that this is a basic jersey item, we do not expect a dramatic spike in late November before the holiday season, but we must maintain enough stock to cover the current stable baseline. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established autumn regime, providing a balanced stock level that avoids excessive holding costs while preventing stockouts on this low-margin/low-cost item.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is currently in a stable autumn/winter demand regime. Since late September (Period 34), demand has fluctuated between 6 and 22 units, with a very stable average of approximately 13-14 units over the last 8 periods. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P38-P41) show demand of 15, 9, 13, and 6, averaging 10.75. Given the product description as a 'Jersey top with narrow shoulder straps,' it is a base-layer basic in late November (Date: 2019/11/25), which typically sees consistent but low off-season demand compared to spring. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-summer stabilization while maintaining enough buffer for occasional minor spikes (like the 22 units in P37). This approach balances the high holding cost ($1.0) against the moderate profit ($1.0) by targeting a 50% service level base stock, which the OR backend will calculate.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck vest top) is currently in a stable, low-volume demand regime typical for late autumn/early winter 'Basics'. Looking at the last 10 periods (Periods 33-42), demand has averaged 11.9 units with low volatility, despite small fluctuations. The most recent demand (Period 42) was 9 units. Since the lead time has remained consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), I will continue to set L to 'default'. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 10 to capture this stabilized Q4 baseline while filtering out the higher volume seen in the spring and summer. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N of 10 to reflect the current lower volatility. This ensures the OR backend maintains small but sufficient inventory for this period's demand without overstocking and incurring holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Q4 demand baseline established: Demand for Periods 33-42 has averaged ~12 units, confirming a significant reduction from the earlier spring/summer peaks and establishing a stable winter floor for this item.

The last five weeks specifically show a slight downward drift (9, 13, 6, 9, 4), averaging 8.2 units. Given that holding costs equal profit ($1.0), it is critical to avoid overstocking during this low-velocity period. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=10 to set mu_hat, which captures this Q4 stability while smoothing recent micro-fluctuations.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck strap top) has reached its seasonal floor, consistently averaging approximately 10-12 units over the Pearl Harbor and early December period. The last 5 periods (P40-P44) have seen actual demand values of 13, 6, 9, 4, and 7 (average = 7.8). This represents a further tightening of the Q4 baseline established in the previous insights. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in the history. Given the high holding cost relative to the unit price ($1.0 holding vs $1.0 profit), I am using a recent_N window (N=5) to capture this most recent low-volume regime and minimize excess inventory, as overstocking would be particularly costly at this service level equilibrium.

Carry-over insight: Mid-December demand floor confirmed: Demand has averaged 7.8 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 40-44), reflecting the absolute seasonal low for this basic summer item during the winter months.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (Women's Jersey V-neck top) is in its absolute seasonal trough as it is a basic summer item during the mid-winter period (late December). Demand has consistently declined and stabilized at a very low level. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 41-45), demand was 6, 9, 4, 7, and 5, averaging 6.2 units per week. This aligns with the 'everyday basics' category behavior for off-season items. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the next week is the week of December 23rd (Christmas week), demand is expected to remain at this structural floor or even dip slightly due to holiday closures, though for basics, the floor is usually stable. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers these single-digit demand levels without accumulating excess holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, right at the end of the year. Demand for this 'Jersey Basic V-neck strap top' (a summer-centric garment) has remained extremely low throughout Q4, confirming its seasonal nature. However, Period 46 showed a surprising uptick to 13 units, despite a 5-week average of ~7.8 units previously. This is likely a small variation or a minor post-holiday effect rather than a sustained regime shift. Given the item's high sensitivity to seasonality (observed in early Q1 last year), I am maintaining a conservative forecast while slightly adjusting for the recent demand spike to prevent another stockout. I will use a short window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most current winter floor baseline (~7.6 units), ensuring we avoid excessive holding costs on a low-margin basic during its off-season. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods.
