Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a skater skirt (729928001) from the 'Divided' collection, retailing at $4.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost. Historically, demand has been increasing slightly each week from 71 to 80+ units. Given that we are entering mid-February, we are approaching the Spring fashion season where demand for skirts typically rises. Since there are only 5 historical samples and no prior shipments to evaluate lead time, I will use 'default' for L (promised 0) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current mean (approx. 80.4) and volatility. This ensures the OR engine starts with a baseline that reflects the immediate recent trend while we wait for lead time observations.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a skater skirt, which is a staple item but can see early spring demand spikes. In Period 1, we ordered 87 units based on a lead time of 0. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms the actual lead time was 0, as the order arrived and was sold in the same period. However, we had a stockout: demand was 97 but we only had 87 on hand, resulting in 0 ending inventory and lost sales. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) were 71, 79, 82, 90, 80 (Mean ~80.4). The recent demand of 97 in P1 suggests an upward trend as we move further into February/Spring. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent increase in demand and volatility, staying responsive to the stockout observed in the last period while the backend OR logic balances the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Short skater skirt' in the 'Divided Collection', which typically targets a younger demographic and is highly seasonal. The current date is late February (2019-02-25). Historical demand from Jan to early February was stable around 80 units. However, in Period 2 (Feb 18), demand spiked significantly to 171 units (+113% over the Jan average). This suggests a strong transition into the Spring fashion season. Currently, the system is stocking out (ending on-hand 0 for two consecutive periods) because demand is outstripping previous order quantities based on older means. The promised lead time of 0 is being met. To capture the recent spike and prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost, I will use the most recent 3 samples (including the spike) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a higher base stock to meet the rising Spring demand. L remains default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-18: average increased from ~80 to 171 (+113%), likely due to the start of the Spring fashion season for the Skirts category.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. We are in the Spring season for the 'Skirts' category. We have observed a significant demand regime shift since February 18th. Initial data (pre-shift) showed demand around 80, but since P2 (Feb 18), we saw demand spikes to 171 and 105 (average ~138). The Period 3 demand of 105 was lower than Period 2's 171, but still significantly higher than the baseline of 80. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Based on the product category (Skirts/Short skater skirt) and the onset of Spring, volatility is high. I will use the recent_N method (N=3) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher Spring demand while averaging the spike from Period 2 with the more moderate Period 3. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased variance seen during the seasonal transition.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Short skater skirt', which typically sees a demand increase as spring approaches. Period 2 (2019-02-18) saw a significant spike (171), but demand has since stabilized or slightly declined in Periods 3 and 4 (105 and 73). The 'Demand regime shift' noted in the carry-over history seems to have been a temporary spike or a more volatile start to the season rather than a sustained 171 average; the mean of the last 3 periods (P2-P4) is 116.3. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this post-spike stabilization while remaining responsive to the seasonal shift from the early-year baseline (~80). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility (171 vs 73).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18, 2019. The 'Jessy Jersey Skirt' experienced a significant demand spike in Period 2 (171 units), which was previously identified as the start of the Spring season. However, demand in Periods 3, 4, and 5 has cooled down significantly to 105, 73, and 72 units respectively. This suggests that the initial spike might have been a 'front-loading' event or a short-lived peak. The average demand over the last three periods (P3-P5) is 83.3 units, which is very close to the pre-spike average (~82). Given the on-hand inventory of 87 and the consistent lead time of 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to reflect this stabilizing demand and prevent over-ordering from the outdated spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-Spring-spike: average demand for P3-P5 is 83 units, down from the P2 peak of 171, returning to levels seen in Jan/Feb.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product is a 'Short skater skirt', which typically follows spring/summer seasonality. After a significant demand spike in Period 2 (171 units), demand has stabilized over the last four periods (Periods 3-6) with observations of 105, 73, 72, and 67 units respectively. The mean demand for these last 4 periods is 79.25, which is very close to the Jan/Feb baseline of ~80. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this stabilized post-peak demand. Sigma_hat is also set using N=4 to capture the localized volatility. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time, so L is set to default. Current on-hand is 33 units with 0 in-transit; with L=0, the system needs to cover Period 7 demand immediately.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'short skater skirt', which typically sees stable demand after the initial Spring season spike. Looking at the history (P3-P7), demand has stabilized: 105, 73, 72, 67, 71. Averaging the last four periods (P4-P7) gives 70.75, which aligns with the pre-spike baseline around 70-80. Since the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met in every period from P1 to P7, I will continue to use L=0. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current stable demand regime (P4-P7) while excluding the P2 spike (171) and the P3 transition (105). This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~71 units without overstocking based on the earlier outliers.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (Jessy Jersey Skirt) is experiencing high demand volatility. In Period 8 (2019/04/01), demand spiked to 139 units, up from the ~70 unit baseline seen in Period 4-7. This spike likely corresponds to the lead-up to Easter (April 21, 2019), representing a secondary spring peak. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the recent spike and prevent further lost sales during the Easter season, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat, which averages the demand from Periods 6, 7, and 8 (approx 92 units/period). I will use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand spike detected at Period 8 (2019-04-01): demand rose to 139 (+95% over P4-P7 average), possibly seasonally linked to Easter preparation.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a short skater skirt. Historical performance shows two distinct demand spikes: one in mid-February (171 units) and another in early April (139 units), both likely linked to spring fashion and Easter. In Period 9, demand dropped back down to 64 units, which is consistent with the post-spike normalization seen earlier in the season (March demand averaged ~71). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 9 concluded periods. To avoid overstocking after the secondary spike, mu_hat is set to the recent demand mean from the last 6 periods (P4-P9), which covers the 'normal' demand phase and the recent surge, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 81 units per period. sigma_hat is also set based on this period to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand normalization confirmed: demand dropped to 64 in P9 after the P8 spike of 139 (-54%). Demand patterns for this SKU appear to be characterized by sharp single-week spikes followed by rapid reversion to a baseline of ~70-80 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a short skater skirt. Analysis of the demand history (Periods 1-10) confirms the carry-over insight that demand is characterized by occasional sharp spikes (e.g., P2: 171, P8: 139) followed by a return to a stable baseline of approximately 70 units. Specifically, the last two periods (P9 and P10) had demands of 64 and 72, which aligns with the Jan/Feb pre-season levels. Since the Easter spike (P8) has passed and we are now in late April, I anticipate demand will remain near the current baseline before any potential early-summer lift. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). With On-hand inventory at 34 units and no pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P8-P10) to capture the cycle of the spike and the return to baseline (avg ~91 units), while using a recent 6-period window for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in the Spring season. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected baseline demand plus a safety buffer for potential secondary spikes.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 729928001 (Short skater skirt) is in Period 12 (2019-04-29). Looking at the recent demand history (P9: 64, P10: 72, P11: 80), demand has stabilized around a mean of 72 units following the Easter-related spike observed in P8. The product description and date suggest a steady late-spring demand pattern without imminent major holidays (Easter was 2019-04-21). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all history. In-transit is 0 and on-hand is 36. Since the current demand regime (P9-P11) is stable and slightly trending upwards towards the pre-spike baseline, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this post-Easter stabilization for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock level that accounts for the most recent observations while the OR backend handles the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) trade-off.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a short jersey skater skirt. Historically, we have observed two specific spikes: a Spring season spike (P2) and an Easter-related spike (P8). Currently, demand has stabilized around a baseline of ~71-80 units over the last three periods (P10-P12). There are no immediate major retail holidays in early May that typically drive spikes in this specific 'short skater skirt' category until much closer to late May/early June (pre-summer). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (8 units), we need to set parameters that ensure logic doesn't under-order for the coming week. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable post-Easter regime (avg ~74) and ensure we return to baseline levels without over-reacting to the historical spikes in Feb/April.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-13. Historical demand for SKU 729928001 (Short skater skirt) indicates a consistent baseline demand around 70-80 units, punctuated by sharp, single-period spikes (Period 2: 171 units, Period 8: 139 units). Over the last four periods (P10-P13), demand has been very stable at 72, 80, 71, and 64 units respectively, averaging 71.75 units. There are no major global or regional holidays immediately upcoming in mid-May that typically drive skirt sales, so I expect demand to remain near this baseline. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (ordered and arrived same-period). Given the high margin (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a service level around 80% is targeted by the OR backend. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current stable baseline and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility following the Easter spike.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a short jersey skater skirt, which typically sees high demand in spring and early summer. Historical demand analysis shows a baseline of ~70-80 units, with occasional spikes (171 in P2, 139 in P8) and recent stabilization/decline (49 units in P14). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period from P1 to P14. Given the recent deceleration in demand (64, 49 units in the last two periods), I am setting mu_hat using a shorter window (recent_N=5) to capture this downward trend and avoid overstocking while holding costs are relatively high (1/4 of profit). This results in an average demand calculation based on P10-P14 (avg: 67.2). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to align volatility with this more stable period. Lead time L is set to default (0).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-27. Historical demand for SKU 729928001 (Short skater skirt) has stabilized into a baseline of approximately 70-80 units, but the most recent two periods (P14 and P15) showed a decrease to 49 and 45 units respectively. Previous carry-over insights correctly identified that spikes (P2, P8) are followed by rapid reversions to baseline. Currently, on-hand inventory is 33. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable based on history. Since demand appears to be softening slightly (averaging 52 over the last 3 periods vs 70-80 previously), I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this slight downward trend while maintaining enough stock for the established baseline. I will keep L at default (0) as all orders have arrived on time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand for the 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' shows a steady baseline with occasional sharp spikes (e.g., P2 and P8). Most recently, demand in P16 rose to 85, exceeding the previous three periods (P13-P15: 64, 49, 45). As we move into June (peak summer season for skirts), I anticipate a potential sustained demand increase or frequent spikes. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in P16, meaning we lost 10 units of demand (demand=85, sold=75). To recover and capture the anticipated early summer demand while balancing the $1.00 holding cost against $4.00 profit (desired service level ~80%), I will use a shorter window (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the recent upward movement desde P13 and provide a slightly more responsive forecast. Sigma_hat will use a broader window (N=10) to account for the volatility seen in the April spike while ignoring the extremely high February surge.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a short skater skirt, which typically sees sustained demand during summer months. Historically, the demand for this SKU has operated in a baseline range of 65-80 units, with occasional spikes. Over the last 4 periods (P14-P17), demand has been 49, 45, 85, and 73, averaging 63 units. This suggests a slight downward trend compared to the early spring baseline, but we are entering the peak summer season. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in the history. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand mean and volatility while remaining responsive to the 70+ levels seen in the last two weeks. Setting L to 'calculate' for consistency with observed zero lead time and using N=5 for demand parameters to bridge the recent lower demand with the latest uptick.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a short skater skirt, which is a summer-relevant item. Reviewing historical demand, the SKU has a consistent baseline between 70-80 units, with occasional spikes. Over the last 4 periods (P15-P18), the average demand has been approximately 71 units (45, 85, 73, 81). The last three periods specifically show a slight upward trend toward the high end of the baseline (avg 79.6). Given that we ended Period 18 with 0 on-hand inventory due to stockouts in P16 and P18, we need to ensure enough stock to cover the upcoming period. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand baseline (approx 80 units/period) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to account for the volatility seen in the last two months, including the occasional shifts.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical data (P13-P19) shows demand is trending slightly upward (avg ~71) compared to the mid-May dip (P14-P15 avg ~47), with the most recent demand hitting 99 units. This suggests a transition into summer peak demand for this short skater skirt. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Since the last 7 periods (P13-P19) capture this gradual recovery and recent volatility better than the long-term average, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will allow the OR engine to react to the recent 99-unit demand spike while maintaining a buffer for the observed variance. Inventory is currently 0, so the base stock calculation will drive the order to cover expected demand plus a safety stock for the lead time + review period.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend starting P16 (late May): Average demand increased from ~47 (P14-P15) to ~78 (P16-P19), reflecting early summer seasonality for the short skater skirt.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (short skater skirt) is exhibiting a strong seasonal spike in late June, likely driven by mid-summer high temperatures and holiday demand. Period 20 demand (162) is a massive jump from the P16-P19 average (~85) and even surpassed the earlier Spring peak (171). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods. To capture this summer surge while accounting for the high volatility shown by single-week spikes, I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the summer uptick, but I will explicitly set mu_hat higher than the previous average to avoid stockouts during this peak. N=5 covers the shift starting in late May (P16). Given demand was 162 in P20, a forecast for P21 of ~140-150 is prudent to maximize profit ($4) versus holding cost ($1). Setting mu_hat explicitly to 150 ensures a high baseline for the OR engine's base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Period 20 demand spiked to 162 units (+90% over P16-P19 average), consistent with peak seasonality for the 'short skater skirt' category in early July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/8. We are in the peak summer season for the 'short skater skirt' category. Historical patterns show significant single-week spikes followed by rapid regressions or secondary high-demand weeks. Period 20 saw a massive spike to 162 units, and Period 21 remained high at 111 units. This suggests the summer peak has higher sustained volume than the Easter spike. Based on the previous pattern (P8 spike 139 -> P9 drop 64), I expect demand to regress toward a summer baseline higher than the spring baseline. The average of the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 102 units, which captures the current summer regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 70, and we want to cover the potential for another ~100+ unit week while minimizing holding costs if demand drops further, using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a balanced responsive forecast to the current high-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (late May - July) shows higher baseline and volatility: P16-P21 average is 102 units/period, compared to the ~80 unit baseline in Spring.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'short skater skirt', which has shown peak seasonality throughout June and early July. Current date is mid-July (2019/07/15). Historically, demand spiked to 162 in Period 20, then eased to 111 and 91 in the subsequent periods. The Carry-over insight for Period 22 notes a established summer baseline of 102 units/period (P16-P21). However, the most recent demand of 91 shows the late-summer deceleration is beginning. To manage this, I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods (P16-P22) to capture the summer regime while allowing the backend to incorporate the recent softening. Lead time is consistently 0. mu_hat is set to cover the summer average (~100 units) to avoid stockouts while the product is still in season.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a short skater skirt, which is highly seasonal for the summer. Analysis of the recent summer regime (starting Period 16, late May) shows a higher mean and significant volatility compared to the spring baseline. Specifically, demand in the last three periods (P21-P23) has been 111, 91, and 84, following a peak of 162 in P20. While the peak has passed, demand remains consistently above the earlier baseline of ~70. I will use recent_N with N=8 (covering P16 to P23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated summer regime's average and variance effectively. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (short skater skirt) is currently in its peak summer season (late July). Looking at the recent history, after a major surge in late June (P20: 162 units), demand has remained elevated but volatile. The most recent demand in Period 24 was 129 units, suggesting the summer baseline remains strong despite a brief dip in P22-P23. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there is nothing in transit, I need to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover this high-demand period. I will use a recent_N window of 9 periods (starting from P16 when the summer recovery trend began) to capture the current seasonal regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. This window (P16-P24) provides a mean demand of approximately 102 units, which is appropriate for the current phase compared to the total history mean of ~88.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a 'short skater skirt' (729928001). We are currently at Period 26 (2019/8/5). Historical data shows peak summer demand occurred between late June and July (Periods 20-24), with a peak of 162 and an average around 102 units. The most recent demand (Period 25) was 75 units, suggesting the start of a post-summer decline as is typical for short skirts in August. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P22-P25) is (91+84+129+75)/4 = 94.75 units. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this winding-down summer seasonality while maintaining enough buffer for remaining warm-weather demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. On-hand is 51, and with L=0, the OR engine will order based on base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline initiated: demand dropped to 75 units in P25 (early August) from July peak levels (~100+), signaling the end of the high-summer regime for short skater skirts.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical data and the carry-over insights indicate that we have entered a post-summer demand decline for 'short skater skirts'. Demand has dropped consistently over the last two periods (P25: 75, P26: 53) from the July peaks. Based on the pattern observed earlier in the year (post-Spring spike), demand tends to return to a baseline of approximately 70-80 units, though the current drop to 53 suggests it might dip even lower as we transition out of summer. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture this downward trend immediately, while keeping sigma_hat at a broader 5-period window to account for the residual volatility of the summer transition. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-19. We are in a post-summer demand decline for the SKU '729928001' (short skater skirt). Since Period 25 (late July/early August), demand has consistently dropped from summer levels (~100+) to 75, 53, and 53. This indicates a transition back to a lower baseline as the peak summer season ends. To reflect this shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P25-P27) where demand averaged 60.3 units. This N=3 choice captures the immediate downward trend while excluding the older, high-demand summer peaks. Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline confirmed (starting Aug 2019): Demand dropped from a July average of ~100+ to an average of 60 over P25-P27 (-40%), reflecting end-of-season for skater skirts.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/26. The SKU (729928001, Short skater skirt) has exited its summer peak and is now in a confirmed low-demand regime (end-of-season). Since Period 25 (Late July/August), demand values have been: 75, 53, 53, 50. This represents a significant and sustained drop from the July average (~100+) to a new baseline of approximately 50-60 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is 22, with 0 in-transit. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current low-demand/low-volatility regime (P25-P28) and avoid over-ordering based on the high-summer data. This helps the OR backend minimize holding costs during the seasonal downturn while maintaining a sufficient service level for the current 50-60 unit weekly demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. The product is a 'short skater skirt', which is highly seasonal. We have confirmed a post-summer demand decline that started in August. The recent demand samples (P25-P29) are: 75, 53, 53, 50, 70. This averages 60.2 units per period. The recent uptick to 70 in P29 suggests stabilization at the new lower baseline rather than a continued freefall. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods (as confirmed by the last 29 periods), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering August to present) to capture the current post-summer regime (avg ~60). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to capture the reduced volatility observed since the high-summer peaks subsided. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the 60-unit average plus a safety buffer for the moderate variance.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The SKU is a 'short skater skirt', which has finished its peak summer season (June/July). Historical data from Period 28-30 shows demand has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 58 units (50, 70, 53). This aligns with the 'post-summer demand' carry-over insight. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the transition into early autumn, I expect demand to remain at this lower baseline or potentially decrease further as colder weather approaches. I will use a 6-period window (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the post-summer stabilization (Periods 25-30) while excluding the July peaks. This provides a mean demand of ~59 units. Sigma_hat will also use N=6 to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product is a 'short skater skirt', which has shown clear seasonal behavior: peaks in Spring (Feb/March) and Summer (June/July), followed by a sustained decline in late August/September as the season ends. The carry-over insights confirm a post-summer demand drop to an average of ~60 units. Recent demand (P28-P31: 50, 70, 53, 67) averages 60 units with low volatility compared to the summer peak. We are now in a late-season regime where demand is stable but lower. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-summer baseline, effectively setting a base stock that covers the expected 60 units of demand while maintaining minimal holding cost for a declining seasonal item.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is a 'short skater skirt', which has finished its peak summer season (June-July). Based on historical data from August and September (Periods 25-32), the demand has stabilized into a lower, post-summer regime. Specifically, the average demand from Period 28 to Period 32 is approximately 61 units (50, 70, 53, 67, 65), confirming the 'post-summer decline' noted in the Carry-over Insights (approx. 60 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory is low (4 units on hand). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this stable, lower baseline, and sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect current volatility. This will ensure sufficient stock for the current baseline while avoiding excessive holding costs as the season winds down.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Period 33 (Sept 23) showed a significant demand spike of 120 units, compared to the recent baseline of ~60 units established since late August (P28-P32). This likely represents a late-September surge, potentially related to university 'freshers' season or a final marketing push for the jersey skirt category. Since this follows a period of stability, I will treat it as a temporary spike but increase the forecast slightly to ensure availability if the surge persists for another week. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the stable baseline plus the recent spike (Periods 28-33), which balances the 'back-to-school' surge against the overall post-summer decline.

Carry-over insight: Late-September demand surge detected: P33 demand rose to 120 units (+100% over P28-P32 average of 60), likely corresponding to seasonal retail events (e.g., student/freshers season).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 729928001 (Short skater skirt) indicates a seasonal surge that began in Period 33 (demand 120) and continued into Period 34 (demand 90), compared to the previous baseline of ~60 units. This aligns with the 'freshers season' or 'back-to-school' retail window. Current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). In-transit is 0. Since the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met (actual L=0 in all concluded periods), I will keep L=0. To capture the current higher-demand regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the mean of periods 30-34 (~78 units), which balances the high spikes (120, 90) with the preceding baseline. This ensures sufficient stock for a continued elevated demand period while minimizing holding cost risks if demand reverts to baseline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (Short skater skirt) is currently in a post-peak demand phase. After a late-September surge (P33 demand of 120), the demand has stabilized over the last two weeks (P34: 90, P35: 81), averaging 85.5 units. This suggests the autumn 'student season' spike is subsiding, but demand remains higher than the August baseline (~60). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To balance against the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) which favors a higher service level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P33-P35) to capture this elevated but declining demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the heightened volatility seen during the recent spike and subsequent stabilization.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand surge observed in P33 (120 units) and P34 (90 units) has begun to subside. P36 demand was 54 units, following 81 units in P35. This confirms the pattern noted in Carry-over Insights (Period 10 and 34) where spikes are followed by a reversion to a baseline of approximately 60-80 units. In this late October period (P37), demand typically stabilizes before any potential pre-holiday activity. The on-hand inventory is 61 units, which is close to the expected baseline demand. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the normalization from the late-September peak (avg of P33-P36 is ~86 units), and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to account for the recent volatility. This ensures we don't over-react to the single high spike while maintaining enough safety stock for the end of the Autumn season.

Carry-over insight: Post-late-September surge normalization: Demand decreased from 120 (P33) to 54 (P36), confirming the SKU's pattern of sharp spikes followed by a return to a ~60-80 unit baseline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' is currently in late October, transitioning into the winter season. Historical demand shows sharp spikes followed by stabilization around a 60-80 unit baseline. Period 37 saw a demand of 105, which is an increase from the previous period (54) but remains within the observed volatility of the current regime. Over the last 4 periods (P34-P37), average demand is 82.5 units, which is consistent with the established baseline after the September surge. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. The target inventory level (base stock) needs to account for the current baseline mean (~80) and moderate volatility to avoid stockouts during periodic demand spikes, especially with on-hand inventory currently very low (5 units). I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-September stabilization while providing enough buffer for current volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. This SKU (short skater skirt) is experiencing a late-autumn demand surge, potentially driven by pre-holiday sales or indoor party season. Demand in Period 38 spiked to 127 units (previous was 105), which is significantly higher than the typical 60-80 unit baseline seen in early October. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to the high demand in P38 exceeding the available stock. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with no evidence of delays. Given the recent upward trend (P37: 105, P38: 127), I will use a recent demand window to capture this heightened volatility and mean, specifically N=3 (covering P36-P38) to account for the current regime shift while discounting the lower demand from early October. This choice balances the high service level required by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (80% critical ratio) with the increased demand variance.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge detected starting Late October (P37-P38): Average demand increased to 116 units (+110% over P34-P36 average), likely due to pre-holiday/party season seasonality for the short skater skirt.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (short skater skirt) is currently in a high-demand regime likely driven by pre-holiday/party season. Period 39 concluded with 80 demand, a decrease from the spike of 127 in P38, but the average for the last three periods (P37-P39) remains high at 104 units, compared to the previous baseline of ~70. Historical patterns for this SKU show sharp single-period spikes (e.g., P33, P20, P8) followed by a return to a shifted baseline. Given we are in mid-November, I expect demand to remain elevated or volatile leading into December. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the current high-demand regime while acknowledging the recent reversion from the P38 peak, I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the recent average of ~104 units per period. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the backend will target a safety stock around the 80th percentile. This approach ensures sufficient stock for ongoing holiday demand while protecting against overstocking if demand reverts further toward the 80-unit mark.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (short skater skirt) is currently in a pre-holiday/party season demand surge which started around Period 37 (Late October). Historically, this SKU exhibits sharp demand spikes (often 100-160 units) followed by rapid normalization back to a baseline of 60-80 units. In the most recent four periods (P37-P40), demand was 105, 127, 80, and 71. This shows the typical pattern: a two-week spike (avg 116) followed by two weeks of decline (avg 75.5). Given we are now in mid-November (Period 41), we are likely settling back into the baseline before any potential December peak. The current inventory is 53 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (N=4) to capture this recent surge and subsequent cooling, resulting in an average of (105+127+80+71)/4 = 95.75 per period. Since lead time is 0, mu_hat = (1+0)*95.75 \u2248 96. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility (std \u2248 25) observed during this surge cycle.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. This SKU (729928001, JESSY JERSEY SKIRT) exhibits sharp demand spikes around retail events followed by reversions to a baseline. We are currently in the pre-holiday/party season. Period 37-38 saw a surge (avg 116), but the last three periods (P39-P41) have averaged 80.3 units, indicating a slight cooling or normalization after the initial late-October jump. Given the product's 'party season' relevance and the upcoming end-of-year holidays (December), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5 periods (P37-P41) which capture both the surge and the recent normalization (avg ~95). Observed lead time remains 0 consistently. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility of this holiday regime while ensuring we are prepared for potential December spikes.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked to 243 units, a 170% increase over the previous 3-period average of ~80. This is highly consistent with Black Friday / Cyber Monday seasonality for apparel. Historical patterns for this SKU show sharp spikes followed by a return to baseline. However, the first week of December (Period 43) often sustains higher-than-normal volume due to ongoing holiday shopping and the 'party season' context for skater skirts. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we faced a massive stockout in P42, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 140 to provide a buffer for potential post-Black-Friday volume while acknowledging the inevitable reversion toward the 70-100 baseline. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility introduced by the 243-unit spike. L remains default as lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday surge confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 243 units (+170% over previous average), demonstrating extreme peak seasonality in late November.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'short skater skirt', which showed a massive demand spike (243 units) during the late November (Period 42) Black Friday week. Period 43 demand came in at 112 units, confirming a rapid post-peak decline, consistent with the SKU's historical pattern of sharp holiday spikes followed by reversion (similar to the Easter spike in P8 and late-September spike in P33). We are now in early December. Based on the pattern after the P33 surge and the P8 surge, I expect demand to stabilize around a baseline of ~80-100 units as we approach the final weeks of December and the end of the simulation. For Period 44, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the higher late-year mean (P39-P43 average is ~120), but acknowledge that P42 was an outlier. The backend OR logic (profit $4 vs holding $1) targets an 80% service level. Setting L to 'default' (0) as actual lead time has consistently matched promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand normalization: demand dropped from 243 (P42) to 112 (P43). Early December demand is expected to settle into a 80-100 unit/period baseline before year-end.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Demand in Period 44 was 118, demonstrating a slightly higher level than the predicted 80-100 unit baseline mentioned in the Period 44 insight, possibly due to pre-Christmas gifting. Historical data for this SKU consistently shows sharp, single-week spikes followed by rapid reversion to a baseline. We have seen peaks in February (171), April (139), June (162), September (120), and late November (243). Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P44) has averaged 115 units. Given that we are now entering the final two weeks before Christmas, demand may remain elevated or see a final festive spike before the typical year-end drop-off. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current post-spike stabilization level (avg ~124) while accounting for the recent variance via sigma_hat (recent_N=5 to capture the Black Friday volatility).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019 (Period 46). We are in the post-holiday/pre-Christmas week. Historically, this SKU (short skater skirt) shows 80-120 units of demand in early December, with a drop to 70 units in the most recent period (P45). Given the holiday season, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease as the party season peaks and transitions into the post-Christmas lull. On-hand inventory is 145 units, which is relatively high compared to recent demand of 70-112. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid high holding costs while maintaining a buffer for potential end-of-year sales, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat (average demand of ~100) and sigma_hat to reflect recent post-Black Friday volatility, allowing the OR backend to normalize stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The SKU 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' is transitioning out of the holiday/party season and into the post-Christmas/low-January period. Historical demand shows a significant drop in late December (P46: 42 units) following the holiday regime. This is consistent with the product's pattern of sharp seasonal spikes followed by a return to a baseline of approximately 60-80 units, or even lower during the deep winter lull. Given the on-hand inventory of 103 units, which already exceeds the expected baseline demand for the next period, and the clear downward trend (P44: 118, P45: 70, P46: 42), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this immediate deceleration. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to reflect the high volatility experienced during the holiday surge while allowing it to settle as demand stabilizes. Lead time remains at the promised 0 periods as arrivals have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand decline confirmed (Late Dec 2019): Demand dropped from early Dec average of ~115 to 42 in P46 (-63%), marking the end of the holiday/party season regime.
