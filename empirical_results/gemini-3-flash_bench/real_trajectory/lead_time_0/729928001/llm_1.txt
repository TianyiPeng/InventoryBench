  "rationale": "a) Product Analysis: The item is a 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' (short skater skirt) from the Divided collection. Given the date is February 11th, we are approaching spring, but it is still currently late winter. Short skirts often see increased demand as spring/summer collections launch or as school seasons peak. b) Demand Regime: Historical data (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows demand between 71 and 90, with an average of approximately 80 units/week. There is a slight upward trend (71 -> 79 -> 82 -> 90) before a small dip to 80 in the last week. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0. With L=0, I need to cover demand for the current period (the period during which the order arrives). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. e) Order Logic: To cover the current period's expected demand (avg ~80) and account for the upward trend/potential spring seasonality, I will target a stock level of 90 units. Since on-hand is 0, the order will be 90 units.",

Period 1 (2019-02-11) showed a spike to 97, which resulted in a stockout (sold out 90/90).

Demand has trended from 70s to high 90s. I will forecast demand at approximately 100 units for Period 2 to capture continued growth while minimizing the risk of high holding costs ($1.0/unit).

Looking at the demand history, there was a significant spike in Period 8 (demand=139), nearly double the previous six-week average of ~73. This uptick corresponds with early April, typically when spring apparel demand surges as weather warms. Based on the historical data (Jan/Feb demand was 71-90, early March settled around 70-75), the Period 8 jump to 139 suggests a new high-demand regime for the spring season. However, Period 8 ended with a stockout (ending inventory 0), meaning we lost approximately 54 potential sales (139 demand - 85 on-hand). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To maximize profit and prevent another stockout while demand is high, I will forecast Period 9 demand to be approximately 140-150 units.
