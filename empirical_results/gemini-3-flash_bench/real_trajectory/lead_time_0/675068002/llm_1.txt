This is a staple wardrobe item but typically sees increased demand as we move into Spring. \nDemand Regime: Historical data shows a steady climb in sales: 41, 41, 41, 47, 51. The mean demand for the last 5 weeks is 44.2, with a clear upward trend (+24% over 5 weeks). \nTiming: We are at Feb 11th. We are entering the pre-Spring retail season where lighter cotton tops like this see increased traction. \nLead Time: Promised lead time is 0. This means an order placed now should arrive in time for this period's demand resolution. \nInventory/Pipeline: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. I must cover Period 1 demand immediately. Given the upward trend (51 last week), I expect Period 1 demand to be between 50-60. \nSafety Stock & Order: To maximize profit and avoid stockouts on a low-lead-time item, I will target availability for the high end of the historical range. Ordering 65 units to cover expected demand (~55) plus a small buffer for the trend, while keeping holding costs (which are 25% of profit) in mind.",

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (281) exceeded available supply (175).

  "rationale": "Demand for the womens cotton blouse has stabilized in a post-holiday low-velocity regime. After the Black Friday peak (295 units in P42), demand has declined and settled into a range of 50-70 units (P45-P46). Given the date is Dec 30, we expect a quiet start to January. With an on-hand inventory of 66 units and an expected demand of ~55 units, the current stock covers the immediate need. As lead time is 0, we can afford to minimize holding costs by not ordering until the existing stock is depleted or demand signals a new spring surge.",
