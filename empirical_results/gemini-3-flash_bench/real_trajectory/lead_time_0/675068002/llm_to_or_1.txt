Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Feb 11, 2019. We are looking at a 'Straight-cut shirt' in an airy cotton weave, which is a staple item but likely sees some seasonal lift as spring approaches in the Northern Hemisphere. Historically, demand has been extremely stable and slightly increasing: 41, 41, 41, 47, 51. The mean of these 5 samples is 44.2. Promised lead time is 0. Since there are only 5 samples and a slight upward trend, I will use all 5 samples (N=5) to establish the baseline. I will use 'default' (promised lead time 0) for L, 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent slight increase, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 (2019-02-11), we ordered 49 units, which arrived immediately (lead_time=0). However, demand was 158 units, resulting in a significant stockout and 109 lost sales. This indicates a massive upward shift in demand compared to the initial historical samples (which averaged ~44). The date (Feb 18) and the product (Womens Everyday Blouse) suggest a possible early spring seasonal ramp-up or a promotion. Given Period 1 demand of 158 and previous samples 41/41/41/47/51, a 'recent_N' approach with N=1 would be too volatile, but the shift is clearly substantial. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the most recent demand spike while acknowledging the lead time is currently 0. mu_hat target: (1+L) * 158 = 158. sigma_hat will be estimated explicitly to handle the high volatility seen in the jump from 51 to 158.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Period 1 (from ~44 up to 158). Lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The historical demand provided (Jan to early Feb) showed an average around 44 per week. However, since entering the decision phase, demand has surged massively: Period 1 was 158 and Period 2 was 392. This is a classic seasonal or promotional spike (late Feb/spring collections). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0. So far, we have been stock-out constrained: we sold exactly what we ordered (49 units in P1, 192 in P2), leaving demand unmet. To capture this growth, I am increasing the forecast significantly. Given the accelerating demand (158 to 392), I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next period will likely continue to rise or stabilize around 500-600 units based on the current doubling trajectory. I'll set a base for mu_hat (1+L) at 600. Sigma is set high to handle the extreme volatility of this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1: Huge acceleration from ~44 to 392+ (Spring/Summer inventory push). Stock-outs in P1 and P2 indicate actual demand is significantly higher than historical samples.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand (January) was ~44 units/week. Starting in Period 1 (mid-February), demand spiked significantly: 158 units (P1), 392 units (P2), and 359 units (P3). This corresponds to the Spring/Summer launch for this 'airy cotton weave' shirt. The stock-outs in P1 and P2 suggest true demand could be higher than 158/392, settling around 360-400. In P3, we finally met demand (359) with a large order, leaving 368 units on-hand. Lead time is confirmed as 0. For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new Spring regime (mean ~303). Since L=0, mu_hat represents one week of demand. For sigma_hat, recent_N (N=3) captures the high volatility of this new regime (~126). This keeps a healthy base stock to avoid further stock-outs during the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime confirmed: Avg demand increased from ~44 to ~303 units starting P1. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 5 (March 11). The product is a women's airy cotton blouse, which is highly seasonal for Spring/Summer. Historical demand jumped from ~44 to a current Spring regime (P1-P4) with an average demand of 293 units (158, 392, 359, 263). The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels have recovered from initial stock-outs in P1-P2, ending P4 with 147 units. Given the transition into mid-March, we expect demand to remain in this high regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current seasonal mean (approx 293) and 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma to handle the high volatility (std dev approx 104) observed during this regime shift. Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6 (March 18). The product is a women's cotton shirt, a category experiencing a strong spring demand surge starting in Period 1 (late Feb). Demand peaked at 392 in Period 2 and has been naturally decelerating: P3 (359), P4 (263), and P5 (192). This suggests the initial 'push' phase is transitioning into a steady spring sell-through. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=3 to capture this deceleration (avg ~271) which is more representative than the historical 2018/Early 2019 samples (~44) or the peak in P2. Sigma_hat is set with N=3 to reflect the current high volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, allowed same-period replenishment to cover demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed from P3-P5 (359 down to 192), indicating the initial seasonal surge is stabilizing into a mid-season regime.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a feminine cotton shirt, highly seasonal for Spring. Historical demand showed a massive pre-season surge (up to 392 units), which has since decelerated and stabilized. The demand for the last three periods (P4-P6) was 263, 192, and 179. The average of these three periods is approximately 211 units. Given it is late March, demand is expected to remain steady or slightly decline as the peak spring buying window passes. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the stabilized regime (approx 211 per period) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will use a service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8 to balance the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Demand has settled into a mid-season regime (avg ~211 units/period over P4-P6) following the early spring surge.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), the product (Womens Airy Cotton Shirt) is entering peak spring demand. Period 7 saw a demand of 281 units, exceeding the on-hand inventory of 250, resulting in a stock-out. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all 7 historical periods. Demand showed an initial massive surge in February (P1-P3), a stabilization in March (P4-P6 avg ~211), and a fresh spike last week (281). Given the product type and date (April), I anticipate continued high demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P4-P7) which captures the post-surge stability and the recent uptick (avg ~229). With L=0, mu_hat represents one period's demand. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen in the last period compared to the mid-March lull.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains high and volatile entering April; P7 stock-out (281 units) suggests a secondary seasonal peak following the initial February surge.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (April 8). The product is a 'Straight-cut shirt in an airy cotton weave', coinciding with the peak spring season. Historical data shows two distinct surges: one in late February (P2: 392) and another starting late March (P7: 281, P8: 359). We currently have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, having stocked out in both Period 7 and Period 8. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 7 and Period 8 demand were constrained by inventory (we only sold what arrived/was on hand), the actual demand is likely higher than the sales figures. Given the current date and the upward trend in the last two weeks (281, 359), I will forecast based on the most recent high-demand regime. Explicit forecasting is used for mu_hat to account for the stock-outs (latent demand) and for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Secondary seasonal peak confirmed starting P7 (late March). Demand reached 359 units in P8 despite previous stabilization in P4-P6. Stock-outs in P7 and P8 indicate real demand likely exceeds 360 units/period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-April (Period 10). The product is a cotton blouse, which is highly seasonal for Spring. Historically, we experienced a huge initial surge in February (P1-P3, avg ~300+), a stabilization in mid-March (P4-P6, avg ~211), and a secondary peak starting late March/early April (P7-P8, avg ~320). Period 9 showed a drop to 215, which could indicate the end of that secondary peak or just volatility. However, given the product type and date (April 15), we should expect demand to remain relatively high as spring weather becomes consistent. I will use a recent window (N=3) to capture the current active regime (P7-P9) which covers the secondary peak and the latest data point, ensuring we are prepared for demand in the 280-300 range without over-ordering if the P9 drop persists. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the seasonal performance of the Women's Straight-cut cotton shirt, we observed a massive surge in February (P1-P3, avg ~300+), followed by a mid-season stabilization in March (P4-P6, avg ~211), and a secondary peak in late March/early April (P7-P8, avg ~320+). In the most recent periods (P9-P10), demand has decelerated again to an average of 194 units (215 and 173). Lead time is consistently 0. Given the 'airy cotton weave' product description, demand is likely to remain relevant as we enter late spring, but the secondary peak appears to have subsided. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a safety buffer for potential late-April volatility, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat (averaging P7-P10: 281, 359, 215, 173), which results in a mu_hat of ~257. This captures both the tail end of the secondary peak and the recent cooling. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the high volatility (173 to 359) observed during this period transition. L is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in April (P7-P10 range: 173-359). The secondary seasonal peak observed in late March (P7-P8) appears to be cooling as of P9-P10 (avg ~194).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 675068002 (cotton blouse) is in late April (2019-04-29). Observation of recent demand (P9-P11: 215, 173, 160) shows a steady cooling trend after the secondary seasonal peak in March/Early April. The current average demand over the last three periods is approximately 183 units. This downward trajectory suggests the product is exiting its peak spring phase. I will set N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining a slightly wider N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen throughout the season, ensuring the safety stock remains robust against sudden spikes. Lead time (L) is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration from secondary peak: avg demand dropped from 320 (P7-P8) to 183 (P9-P11) as of late April.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019/5/06). The product is a women's cotton shirt, which follows seasonal fashion cycles. Recent demand history shows a clear deceleration: from a secondary peak in late March/early April (P7-P8 avg ~320), demand has dropped sequentially for four periods (215, 173, 160, 111). The most recent period (P12) shows the lowest demand since the season began (111). The carry-over insight from P12 noted this deceleration (avg 183 across P9-P11), but given P12's even lower result, we must further refine our demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 (covering P9-P12) to capture this downward trend, as the market is cooling down after the Spring peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period for all 12 periods). On-hand inventory is 133, which is currently higher than the demand in P12, so the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Significant deceleration confirmed. Demand dropped from an April peak of ~360 to a 4-week average (P9-P12) of 165 units, with P12 showing a seasonal low of 111 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/13. The product is a cotton blouse, which is typically seasonal for spring. Historical data shows a clear seasonal arc: a massive early spring surge (P1-P3), a mid-season stabilization (P4-P6), a secondary late April peak (P7-P8), and now a significant downward trend as we move into May. Demand has dropped from ~360 units in P8 to 79 units in P13. The last four periods (P10-P13) show demand of 173, 160, 111, and 79. The most recent demand (79) is the lowest since the seasonal surge began. To avoid excess holding costs on a declining fashion item, I am using a recent_N strategy for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current downward trend while maintaining enough stock for potential late-spring stragglers. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: Continual descent into late spring/early summer. Demand dropped from 111 (P12) to 79 (P13), marking a clear exit from the peak season regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern for this cotton blouse: a massive surge starting in February (P1-P3, avg ~300+), followed by a secondary peak in late March/April (P7-P8, avg ~320), and now a significant deceleration as we enter late May. In the last three periods (P12-P14), demand has dropped to 111, 79, and 87 units respectively (averaging ~92/week). This indicates we have moved out of the high-demand spring regime. The current on-hand inventory is 81 units, which is nearly equal to the most recent period's demand (87). Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 95 to cover the slight upward trend from the last sample (87) while acknowledging the broader downward trend from the season, and use a tight sigma_hat based on recent low-regime variance (P13-P14) to avoid excessive holding costs on a low-margin SKU ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost per period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Cotton blouse seasonal peak has ended. Demand has stabilized at a lower baseline averaging ~92 units/period (P12-P14) compared to the peak season average of 250+. Lead time remains extremely stable at 0 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The 'Melrose' straight-cut cotton blouse has successfully transitioned from its spring peak into a stable low-demand regime for the late spring/early summer. Demand over the last four periods (P12-P15) has been 111, 79, 87, and 106 respectively, averaging approximately 96 units. This confirms the baseline first identified in Period 15 (avg ~92). The lead time remains exceptionally consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a lean inventory while covering the current demand baseline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P12-P15) to capture this post-peak stabilization. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit), necessitating an order that aligns with this new 96-unit average to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs on a low-margin item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 675068002 (cotton shirt) has exited its spring peak and enter a summer low. Demand has transitioned from the high volatile peaks of March/April (avg 250+) to a much lower, more stable regime in May and June. Specifically, the last four periods (P13-P16) have shown demand of [79, 87, 106, 71], averaging ~86 units per period. The 2019/6/3 date suggests early summer positioning where airy cotton weaves might see stable but non-peak demand compared to the early spring 'inventory push'. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this low-season baseline (approx. 90-100 units), ensuring we avoid overstocking and high holding costs as demand cools. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the reduced volatility in this regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product, an airy cotton blouse, is entering the summer season after its primary spring peak (Feb-Apr). Demand has fundamentally shifted from a peak average of ~250 units to a significantly lower and declining summer regime. The last six weeks (P12-P17) show a clear downward trend: 111, 79, 87, 106, 71, and 46. The most recent demand (46) is the lowest since the very first weeks of the year. To reflect this deceleration and prevent overstocking during the summer transition, I am reducing N for mu_hat to the last 3 periods (P15-P17) which averages 74.3 units, significantly lower than the broader historical average. Lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 60, which covers the most recent week's demand, justifying a lower ordering target to minimize holding costs as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Demand continues to decelerate in early June, reaching a seasonal low of 46 units. The 3-week average (P15-P17) is now ~74 units, down significantly from the May average (~90).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a cotton blouse, which experienced a major seasonal peak in February-April (selling up to 392 units/period) and has been in a sustained decline as summer approaches. Recent demand (P15-P18) follows a low-regime pattern: 106, 71, 46, 43. The 4-week average is ~66 units, but the most recent 2 weeks average ~44 units, suggesting a stabilization at this lower level. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 57 units and the steady downward trend/stabilization, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the post-peak average (~66) while allowing for the continued slight downward pressure. This provides a safe buffer against the current demand of 43-46 units while minimizing holding costs for a product clearly past its primary season.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (cotton blouse) is in its summer trough after the spring peak. Demand over the last five periods (P15-P19) has consistently been low, measuring 106, 71, 46, 43, and 74 (average ~68). While P19 saw a slight uptick to 74, the broader trend is a significant deceleration from the spring heights. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid high holding costs while maintaining a service level for the current regime, I will focus on the most recent 5 periods (P15-P19) to set demand parameters. This N captures the current low-season stability while accounting for the recent minor fluctuation.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is an airy cotton shirt, which follows a strong seasonal pattern. We observed a massive peak in late February (P2-P3) and a secondary peak in late March (P7-P8). Since May (P13), demand has been on a sustained downward trend as the peak cotton season concludes. Recent demand (P17-P20) has stabilized at a lower level with values of 46, 43, 74, and 59, averaging ~55.5 units per period. The lead time remains extremely stable at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current low-season stability (approx 55 units/week) and avoid over-ordering based on the high spring volatility.

Carry-over insight: Low-season stabilization confirmed: Demand for the cotton shirt has leveled off in June/July (P17-P20) to an average of ~56 units, down significantly from the spring peaks of 300+.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for the cotton shirt has stabilized into a 'low-season' summer regime. Recent demand values (P17-P21) are 46, 43, 74, 59, and 70, resulting in a 5-period average of approximately 58.4 units. Period 21 ended with 0 units on-hand after a small stock-out (demand 70 vs 68 available), confirming that base stock needs to be maintained around this new average. Lead time remains exceptionally stable at 0 periods. I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable summer demand while ignoring the much higher spring peaks. This should provide sufficient inventory to cover the current demand level without incurring excessive holding costs.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm that the SKU (airy cotton blouse) has moved out of its peak spring season and has settled into a stable, low-demand summer regime. Over the last six periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged 57.5 units, with the most recent measurements being 70 and 53 units. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is low (18 units) following a stock-out in P21. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current stable low-season behavior, ensuring the base stock level targets this lower mean while accounting for recent variance. This helps balance the low holding cost against the need for a modest inventory buffer during the summer slump.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a cotton blouse, which experienced its primary peak in February-April and has since entered a low-season stabilization phase. Over the last seven periods (P17-P23), demand has averaged approximately 53 units (46, 43, 74, 59, 70, 53, 26), although P23 showed a notable drop to 26 units. Given the transition into mid-to-late summer, demand is expected to remain in this lower, slightly volatile regime. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. To handle the recent volatility and the recent dip without overreacting, I will use recent_N methods. For mu_hat, N=7 captures the entire low-season regime (P17-P23). For sigma_hat, N=7 provides a localized measure of variance to ensure the safety stock covers the volatility seen in this period (range 26-74). Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in a low-season regime for this airy cotton blouse. Demand has continued to decline significantly throughout July, dropping from an average of ~56 units in June to a 3-week average of 31 units (P22-P24), with the most recent period (P24) reaching a seasonal low of 15 units. This suggests the product is entering a late-summer clearance or end-of-lifecycle phase. To avoid overstocking and incurring unnecessary holding costs as demand fades, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (covering P20-P24) to capture this recent deceleration. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history, so I am maintaining L=0 to ensure the base stock formula (1+L) reflects a single period of coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Further deceleration in late July. Demand dropped from a June/early July average of ~56 to ~31 units (P22-P24), with a period low of 15 in P24.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. The product is a cotton blouse, which saw peak demand in February-April and has been steadily declining throughout the summer. Demand in the last three periods (P23-P25) has been 26, 15, and 22, averaging 21 units per period. This confirms a low-season regime significantly lower than the June/July average of ~56. On-hand inventory is 43 units, which already covers approximately two periods of current demand. Given a lead time of 0 (consistently observed throughout the game), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect this most recent late-summer deceleration and avoid overstocking as we likely move toward the end of the product's life cycle or a transition to autumn inventory. Lead time remains 'calculate' given its stability at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Demand for the cotton blouse has dropped to a late-summer low, averaging ~21 units (P23-P25) vs the early summer average of ~56.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight cotton blouse (Melrose Womens Everyday), which has experienced a typical seasonal decline from a high in Spring/April (>350 units) to a late-summer low. Current data shows demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level. Over the last four periods (P23-P26), demand has been 26, 15, 22, and 30, averaging 23.25 units. Although Period 26 showed a slight uptick to 30, it remains within the established low-season regime of ~21-25 units identified in recent carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this lower-demand phase, I will use a recent_N window (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-season reality and avoid over-ordering based on the much higher historical Spring demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/19. Historical demand for this 'Women's Everyday Cotton Shirt' shows a massive spring peak (Feb-Apr) followed by a steady decline through summer. We are currently in a late-summer low-demand regime. Since Period 23 (mid-July), demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 23.2 units per period (P23: 26, P24: 15, P25: 22, P26: 30, P27: 33). Although P26 and P27 show a slight uptick, the overall volumes are significantly lower than earlier in the year. P27 resulted in a stock-out (sold 29 with 33 demand), so I need to ensure we hold enough to cover this low-but-stable demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the post-July 15th regime (P23-P27), which averages ~25 units, while accounting for the recent slight increase in volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26). Demand for this airy cotton blouse has been in a sustained decline since its spring/early summer peak. Currently, demand has stabilized in a low-season regime. The most recent demand samples are: P24: 15, P25: 22, P26: 30, P27: 33, P28: 20. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is 24 units. The 'Period 28 conclude' shows an arrival of 32 units and ending inventory of 12, confirming the lead time remains 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this low-season baseline while accounting for minor fluctuations like the slight uptick in P26-P27. With a 0-period lead time, the system will order to meet the base stock requirements for the coming period's demand immediately.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. The product is a cotton blouse, which experienced a massive peak in Spring (Feb-April) followed by a steady decline through Summer. Recent demand (P23-P29) has stabilized into a late-summer low-frequency regime, averaging approximately 25 units per period (15, 22, 30, 33, 20, 29). On-hand inventory is currently very low (2 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive to satisfy this period's demand. I will set L=0 and use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current low-demand stabilization (P23-P29) and prevent over-ordering as we transition toward autumn.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer stabilization confirmed: Demand in August (P26-P29) remains consistent with the late-July drop, averaging ~25 units per period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a stable late-summer/early-autumn regime for this woman's cotton blouse. Demand in August (P26-P30) has been extremely consistent, with a 5-week average of 29.2 units. The last period (P30) saw demand of 34, slightly above the recent mean but within typical variance. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by all concluding messages. Given the transition into September, there is a possibility of a minor back-to-school or office-wear uptick, but current data suggests a stable baseline. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current stable demand level (approx 29 units), and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect recent volatility. The policy will maintain enough stock to cover this demand while minimizing holding costs on a low-margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost) item.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for the airy cotton blouse (SKU 675068002) has fully stabilized into its late-summer/early-fall low-season regime. Over the last five periods (P27-P31), demand has been extremely consistent, with values of 33, 20, 29, 34, and 34, averaging approximately 30 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 following a stock-out where demand (34) exactly matched availability (34) in Period 31. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods, allowing for immediate replenishment. Given the stability of this current regime, I will use a recent window of N=5 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which appropriately reflects the current demand levels of ~30 units while accounting for the recent slight uptick to 34.

The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for the cotton blouse has been stable at a late-summer/early-autumn low for the past 7 periods (P26-P32), averaging 30 units per period. The recent demand sequence is [30, 33, 20, 29, 34, 34, 30]. We are currently in a low-season regime compared to the spring peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on historical concluded messages. On-hand inventory is 6 units. To maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs for this lower-demand period, I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) to capture this specific stable late-season regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current 30-unit average rather than the historical annual average which is skewed by the spring surge.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/Early-autumn stability (P26-P32): Demand has stabilized at an average of 30 units per period, showing much lower volatility compared to the spring season.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the cotton shirt (675068002) spiked in Period 33 to 65 units, more than double the late-summer average of 30. This suggests a potential early-autumn seasonal uptick or 'back-to-work' transition. Combined with a stock-out in Period 33 (sold 35 vs demand 65), inventory is currently at 0. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To address this demand shift, I am moving the mu_hat estimation to use a shorter recent window (N=4) to capture the trend while providing a slightly conservative buffer for the spike. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent window to better reflect the increased volatility compared to the very stable August period.

Carry-over insight: Potential autumn demand shift detected at Period 33: demand increased from an average of ~30 (P26-P32) to 65 units (+116%).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 675068002 is an airy cotton blouse. We are currently in early October (Period 35). Historical data and previous carry-over insights showed a significant demand surge in Period 33 (65 units), which was a 116% increase from the late-summer average of ~30. However, Period 34 demand returned to 34 units. This indicates the Period 33 spike might have been a transitory event (e.g., a specific promotion or weather fluctuation) rather than a sustained autumn regime shift. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Given the volatility (65 in P33 followed by 34 in P34), I will use a short-window (N=3) mean for mu_hat to capture the recent range (avg ~43) while maintaining a higher sigma_hat to protect against further spikes. On-hand is currently 21 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: The autumn demand shift suspected at Period 33 (65 units) appears transitory or highly volatile, as Period 34 demand returned to 34 units. Regime remains unstable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October. Demand over the last three periods (P33-P35) has been 65, 34, and 38, averaging approximately 45.7 units. This is a slight increase from the late-summer (August/September) average of ~30, but not a full-scale regime shift comparable to the spring surge. The spike in P33 (65 units) appears to be a transitory variance or a small early-autumn bump. On-hand inventory is 18, and pipeline is 0. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent slight uptick while protecting against the volatility seen in P33, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 (covering P32-P35) for mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand environment. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to capture the increased volatility introduced by the P33 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand transition (P33-P35): Demand has seen a moderate increase from ~30 units to an average of ~46 units (+50%), though localized volatility is high.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (Period 37). Historical demand since Period 33 has shown increased volatility as we transition into the autumn season, with demand spikes (65 in P33) and dips (24 in P36). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P33-P36) is approximately 40.25 units, which is higher than the late-summer baseline of ~30. Given the 'Womens Everyday Collection' description, we may see further fluctuations as shifts in weather affect shirt demand. I will use a recent_N window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this autumn transition level (approx 40 units/period) while accounting for the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to capture the recent variance (std dev ~17.5). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition regime (P33-P36): Demand has shifted from a stable late-summer baseline (~30) to a more volatile autumn level averaging ~40 units (+33%).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are exiting the 'Autumn transition' and observing a significant spike in demand. Period 37 demand reached 82 units, which is a substantial increase compared to the previous 4-week average of ~40 units. This suggests a late-autumn or pre-holiday inventory surge may be beginning. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to a stock-out in P37 (82 units vs 55 units available), we must increase our stock targets to capture this potential new regime. Historical lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent window (N=5) to captures the recent volatility and the upward trend in demand while minimizing influence from the much lower late-summer baseline. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using this recent 5-period window to react to the P37 spike and prepare for continued higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Late autumn demand surge detected at Period 37. Demand jumped to 82 units, more than double the late-summer baseline (~30) and significantly higher than the early autumn average (~40).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We have detected a significant late-autumn demand surge for the cotton blouse, likely entering the holiday/winter season. Period 38 demand reached 165 units, a massive increase from the P37 value (82 units) and the previous autumn average (~40). This mirrors the high-growth trajectory seen in the spring, where demand spiked from 41 to 392 within a few weeks. The current stock-out at Period 38 (0 inventory remaining) confirms that actual demand likely exceeds the 165 units sold. Given the urgency of this surge and the 0-period lead time, I am using an explicit forecast to capture this growth. I'll estimate the next period's demand at 200 units (projecting 20% growth on 165) and set mu_hat accordingly (1+L)*200 = 200. Since we are entering a high-volatility regime, I am increasing sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent variance increase (P33-P38).

Carry-over insight: Significant winter demand surge detected at Period 38: Demand jumped to 165 (from 82 in P37 and ~40 in P33-P36). This indicates a new high-growth seasonal regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '675068002' (Cotton Blouse) is exhibiting a second significant seasonal surge as we enter November. Following a sharp jump to 165 units in P38, P39 recorded 112 units. This pattern suggests an autumn/winter demand regime similar to the large scale saw in spring, likely driven by the transition to long-sleeved garments. The 0-period lead time remains consistent. Since P38 and P39 show a new level of demand significantly higher than the previous autumn transition (which averaged ~40), I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use recent demand. I will use N=2 (P38-P39) to prioritize the current surge while balancing for the slight drop in P39, resulting in an average demand baseline of 138.5 units. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility of this transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: High winter demand regime confirmed starting P38. Average demand has shifted from ~40 to ~138 units (P38-P39) as late-autumn seasonality takes effect.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41 (2019/11/18), the SKU remains in a high-demand winter regime. Following the initial surge to 165 units in Period 38, demand has settled at 112 and 127 units in Periods 39 and 40, respectively. The current 3-period average for this winter regime (P38-P40) is 134.7 units, a significant increase from the autumn average of ~40. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 40 conclude' message. I will set L=0 and use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the mean and volatility of this current regime while maintaining responsive inventory levels to avoid stock-outs seen in P37 and P38. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a base stock covering this increased demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the Black Friday and holiday shopping season. Demand has settled into a high-winter regime after the late-October surge, with the last three periods (P39-P41) showing consistent demand (112, 127, 115). The average demand over this 3-period regime is approximately 118 units. Given the product is a cotton blouse, it likely sees heightened interest during holiday gift-giving and festive periods. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level during this high-demand period while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit), I will set mu_hat based on this recent high-winter regime (N=3) to capture the current mean of ~118 units per period, and sigma_hat will be calculated over the same window to account for the stabilized volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: High-winter demand has stabilized at an average of ~118 units (P39-P41) following the initial surge in P38.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 675068002 (Cotton Blouse) has entered a high-demand late-autumn/early-winter regime. Period 42 saw a massive demand spike to 295 units, significantly exceeding the previous stabilization average of ~118 units (P39-P41) and resulting in a total stock-out. In the previous year's history (Feb 2019), a similar 'spring surge' saw demand reach 392 units. Given it is now Dec 2nd, we are likely seeing a holiday-driven peak. The current regime (P38-P42) has an average demand of 162.8 units with very high volatility. To prevent further stock-outs during this peak, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and will use 'calculate' for lead time as it remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed at Period 42: Demand spiked to 295 units, significantly higher than the previous winter average of ~118. This indicates a secondary peak regime similar to the early spring surge.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season. The product is a cotton blouse, which saw a massive demand surge in Period 42 (295 units), followed by a lower, but significant, Period 43 (60 units). This pattern\u2014sharp spikes followed by variance\u2014mirrors the spring peak observed in Period 2 (392 units) and Period 8 (359 units). Historically, peak demand for this item ranges from 250-400 units. Carrying on-hand inventory of 168 is insufficient if another holiday spike occurs. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To capture the expected high demand while acknowledging current high volatility (standard deviation), I am using a recent_N strategy for mu_hat (N=5 covers the start of the winter surge) to capture the average upward trend, but I will explicitly set sigma_hat to a higher value to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for potential 300+ unit spikes. This maintains a high service level to avoid stock-outs seen in Period 42.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime remains highly volatile: Period 42 (295 units) vs Period 43 (60 units). Current strategy must account for potential multi-hundred unit spikes while managing inventory between peaks.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing highly volatile holiday demand. The last three periods show demand of 295 (P42), 60 (P43), and 73 (P44). This pattern mimics the early spring surge where we saw massive spikes followed by temporary stabilization before potential secondary peaks. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Given the high stock-out cost relative to holding cost (4:1), and the history of spikes up to ~300 units in both P2 and P42, we must maintain a high base stock. Since P43 and P44 stabilized around ~70, but P42 hit 295, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (average 142.6) to reflect the recent high-volume regime while keeping sigma_hat calculated from the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the extreme volatility of the 295 spike. This balancing act ensures we have enough to cover a potential return to 200-300 units without over-ordering excessively if\u9700\u6c42 remains at 70.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (starting P42) is characterized by extreme spikes (295 units) followed by stabilization (avg ~67 units in P43-P44), mirroring the early spring volatility pattern.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. This period marks the height of the winter holiday season. Historically, this product (cotton blouse) experienced extreme volatility during holiday/peak periods (e.g., Period 42 with 295 units, following several periods of ~118 units). Recent demand (P43-P45) has been lower, averaging ~64 units, but a pre-holiday or post-holiday clearance spike is possible. Given the history of stock-outs in P42, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the high-volatility window starting from the P42 spike (Avg P42-P45 = 121.75). Lead time is consistently 0. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) will correctly inflate the safety stock to account for the massive variance seen in the last month (range 59-295). This strategy balances the risk of a high holding cost against the high reward of capturing a potential 200+ unit demand spike before the end-of-year season concludes.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (starting P42) is characterized by extreme intermittent spikes (295 units) followed by stabilization (avg ~64 units in P43-P45). Volatility remains the primary risk factor.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the immediate post-Christmas period. Looking back at the historical demand for this cotton blouse (675068002), we observed an extreme holiday spike in Period 42 (Nov 25) of 295 units, which was significantly higher than the winter average. However, demand since that spike (P43-P46) has fallen and stabilized between 52 and 73 units, averaging approximately 61 units. This aligns with the 'intermittent spike' behavior noted in the carry-over insights. Historically, the early spring surge for this item began in Period 1 (mid-February last year). We are currently in a post-holiday lull but must remain aware that demand can still spike before the true spring shift. With on-hand inventory at 168 units and current demand around 60, we are well-covered for the next period. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers P42-P46, capturing both the spike and the recent lull) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high volatility (sigma) while reflecting the current lower demand level.
