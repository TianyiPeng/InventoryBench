Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Calista cardigan' (Womens Knitwear). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) has been relatively stable, ranging from 94 to 110, with an average of approximately 102.4 units per week. Since this is the first decision period, on-hand inventory and in-transit units are zero. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive within this same period. Given the stability of the historical samples and no immediate evidence of a regime shift or seasonality peak (February is late winter/early spring transition, generally steady for knitwear), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering all available history) to establish the initial demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I will use the 'default' lead time (0) as we have no evidence yet to suggest actual lead time differs from promised.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand was 99 units, which aligns with the historical average of approximately 102 units (range 94-110). Since the on-hand inventory is now very low (4 units) and there are no units in transit, we need to restock to meet the expected demand for Period 2. The inventory view is as follows: on-hand=4, in-transit=0. The backend will calculate the order based on the base stock model. Given the stable demand history (5 samples with mean ~102, std ~7.5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the most relevant recent behavior while providing enough stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we experienced a significant stockout: demand jumped to 140 while we only had 101 units available (ending inventory 0). The item is a 'soft, fine-knit viscose blend' cardigan, which is highly relevant for February/early Spring. The historical average demand (P-5 to P-1) was ~102, but Period 2 saw a 40% spike. Given the product type and the timing in late February, this appears to be the start of a seasonal spring demand regime. I am setting L=0 as confirmed by recent history. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent samples including the spike, but I'll set it as 'explicit' to proactively forecast for further seasonal growth. I estimate the new mean demand to be approximately 140. sigma_hat will be set via recent_N to reflect the increased volatility seen in the jump from ~100 to 140.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: significant increase at Period 2 (to 140 units) aligning with seasonal relevance for lightweight knitwear in late February.

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. This SKU is a 'Calista cardigan', a lightweight fine-knit viscose blend, which aligns perfectly with spring transitions. Historical demand data shows a clear regime shift: Period 1 was ~100 units, but Periods 2 and 3 saw a jump to 140 and 137 units respectively. This confirms the 'carry-over insight' of a sustained demand increase starting in late February. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. I will use N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this recent higher-demand regime (averaging ~125 across the last 3 periods, with higher weight on the most recent ~140 range). Setting mu_hat to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand using recent_N=3 ensures we satisfy the new 140-unit baseline while the OR backend manages the service level versus holding cost trade-off (which is 1:1, implying a 50% service level target).

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/11. The product is a fine-knit viscose cardigan (lightweight knitwear), which typically sees higher demand during the transition from winter to spring. Historical demand showed a jump in Period 2 (140) and Period 3 (137), but Period 4 dropped to 89. This drop in Period 4 suggests the initial spring burst might be stabilizing or was a pull-forward. The mean of the last 3 periods (140, 137, 89) is 122. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistent in all concluded periods (P1-P4). Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0), the backend's target service level q = 0.5. Since on-hand is 37 and in-transit is 0, moving to mu_hat based on the last 3 samples (N=3) captures the recent elevated regime while acknowledging the recent dip. L is set to use the calculate method since actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-18. Looking at the history, the product 'Calista cardigan' experienced a demand spike in late February (Periods 2 and 3, averaging 138.5 units), but demand has since stabilized or slightly regressed in early/mid-March (Periods 4 and 5, averaging 90.5 units). The 'Period 3' carry-over insight about seasonal increase seems to have peaked or returned to the baseline established in January (avg ~104). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), which aligns with the promised lead time. Given the recent drop from the spike, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the mix of the high and low recent demand points, preventing an over-reaction to either the spike or the recent drop. I will use recent_N for both mean and volatility to ensure we are covering the current market regime while being sensitive to the higher variance seen recently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (Women's fine-knit cardigan) showed a brief demand spike in late February (Periods 2-3), reaching 140 units, but has since stabilized as we move into late March. Demand over the last three periods (Periods 4-6) has been 89, 92, and 102 (mean ~94.3). The current date is March 25th; spring styles often see steady demand before shifting. Current on-hand inventory is 13 units, and all previous orders (Periods 1-6) have arrived with an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will set L to 0. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this post-spike stabilization (mean ~94), and sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-peak: avg demand returned to ~94 units over Periods 4-6 after the late Feb spike (140 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 experienced a massive demand spike to 173 units, far exceeding the recent average (~94) and even the previous late-Feb peak (140). This occurred on March 25th, potentially coinciding with a Spring fashion launch or pre-Easter shopping. On-hand inventory was completely depleted (sold only 95 units, leaving 0). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods consistently. Given the volatility and the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the OR backend targets a 0.5 service level (the median of the distribution). To avoid stockouts while being cautious of high holding costs, I am shifting mu_hat towards a more recent demand window to capture the upward trend. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat (Avg demand Periods 4-7: ~114) and explicit sigma_hat to reflect higher volatility due to the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand volatility detected at Period 7: Demand spiked to 173 units (+84% vs previous 3-period avg), suggesting a potential secondary Spring demand regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (fine-knit cardigan) is experiencing a significant late-Spring demand surge. Demand in Period 7 (173) and Period 8 (195) has substantially exceeded the previous average (~94-100). The current date is April 8th, suggesting peak Spring seasonality for lightweight knitwear. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and having stocked out in the last two periods, we must aggressively increase the base stock. I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 6, 7, and 8 average demand = 156.6). Given the rapid acceleration from 173 to 195, a sample of 3 provides the most responsive mean and variance for the OR backend to prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April Spring surge resulted in 170+ units/period (avg 184 over last 2 periods), significantly higher than Feb/March baselines.

Daily Reward (R_t): $147.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579541001' (Calista cardigan) is experiencing a high-demand regime in April, likely due to spring seasonality. Demand over the last three periods (P7-P9) has been 173, 195, and 152, respectively, averaging approximately 173 units. This is significantly higher than the earlier March baseline of ~94 units. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent April surge and ensure sufficient stock while balancing holding costs (profit and holding costs are equal at $1.0/unit), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to anchor the forecast on the current high-demand regime. This provides a mu_hat of ~173 (1+L=1). I will also use N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed during this recent spike.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the product (Calista cardigan) is in late April, transitioning from the peak Spring demand surge. Demand peaked at 195 in Period 8 and has since stabilized to a lower but still elevated level (152 in P9, 142 in P10). The average demand over the last four periods (P7-P10) is 165.5, while the last three periods (P8-P10) average 163. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the profit to holding cost ratio results in a service level target of 50% (q=0.5), the OR backend will target the median demand. To capture the current sustained higher demand level while acknowledging the slight cooling since the P8 peak, I will use a N=4 period window for mu_hat (averaging 165.5) and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen during this Spring surge. This N=4 selection covers the entire higher-demand Spring regime from Period 7 onwards.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains elevated in mid-late April (avg 163 over P8-P10) compared to Feb/March baselines, though trailing off slightly from the Period 8 peak of 195.

Daily Reward (R_t): $166.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Calista cardigan is experiencing high but volatile demand as we move into late April/early May. Demand in Period 11 was 176, which exceeded our available stock (166), resulting in a stockout. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 166.25, significantly higher than the early spring baseline. Promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0. Given the recent stockout and the high volatility (ranging from 142 to 195 in the last 4 weeks), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average to capture the elevated Spring demand level. Sigma_hat is set using the same recent window to account for the current high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in late April (P11 demand: 176); the Spring demand regime (avg ~166 over P8-P11) is sustained but significantly more variable than the mid-March period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is a lightweight cardigan, which is seasonally relevant for late Spring. Reviewing the demand history: Period 11 (176) and Period 12 (187) show that demand remains very strong and is actually increasing slightly as we move into May. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 170.4. Despite high sales, we have ended the last two periods with zero inventory, suggesting significant lost sales and that the OR backend's default capping or my previous parameters were too conservative given the 100% service level target (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0 implies q=0.5, but stockouts are costly in total reward). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (Spring regime) and use an explicit sigma_hat of 25 to account for the high volatility (range of 142 to 195) seen in this regime, ensuring the base stock level is high enough to capture the ceiling of the current demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime (started P8) remains strong into May, with average demand increasing to ~181 over the last two periods (P11-P12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/05/06), demand hit a cycle high of 198 units, confirming that the May Spring peak is in full effect for this lightweight cardigan. The SKU has stocked out in 4 of the last 7 periods (P7, P8, P11, P12, P13 all had sold units equal to starting inventory), indicating that demand is consistently outstripping supply. The Spring demand regime (starting P8) shows an average demand of 175.3 over the last 6 periods, with the last 3 periods specifically averaging 187 units. To capture this peak and mitigate chronic stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 (P11-P13) to reflect this 180+ unit pace. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N of 6 to capture the volatility seen throughout this Spring regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand Spring peak confirmed: Average demand over P11-P13 is 187 units (+13% vs early Spring avg), with significant stockouts occurring due to demand exceeding ordering caps.

Daily Reward (R_t): $163.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Calista cardigan is in the midst of a sustained high-demand Spring peak. Observations from Period 11 to 14 show demand values of 176, 187, 198, and 175, respectively. This gives a 4-period average of approximately 184 units. Despite heavy stockouts in Periods 11-13 where demand exceeded available inventory, Period 14 finally saw an ending inventory of 12 units, confirming a demand of 175. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maximize service level while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed during this peak regime, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current stable high-demand level (~184). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the significant variability seen during this peak period, ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation is robust against further spikes.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Calista cardigan' shows a strong spring peak starting in April (Period 8) and continuing through May. Demand reached a high of 198 (P13) but has shown signs of cooling in the most recent two periods (P14: 175, P15: 153). The Spring demand regime is still active, but the intensity is diminishing as we approach June. To avoid overstocking while the season winds down, I will use a recent N approach (N=5) to capture the elevated average (approx 178) while respecting the current downward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers current elevated demand levels, adjusted for the high holding cost which equals profit, necessitating a balanced stock position.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering from May peak: Average demand over P14-P15 (164) is lower than the P11-P13 peak (187), indicating the late-Spring surge is beginning to subside.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the demand for the Calista cardigan (lightweight viscose knitwear) is showing a slight downward trend as we move further into the summer months. Demand for the last three periods (P14-P16) was 175, 153, and 169, averaging approximately 166 units. This is a noticeable drop from the May peak where demand hit 198 (P13). Given the product description (lightweight knitwear) and the date (early June), we are likely entering a transitional period where the initial spring surge is tapering off. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (critical as profit=holding cost, suggesting a target cycle service level of 50%, but the OR engine's cap and base stock logic will target slightly higher due to the formula), I will use the last 3 periods (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent downward-trending demand regime, ensuring the OR backend reacts quickly to the tapering demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed: Average demand has decreased to 166 units over P14-P16 (approx -11% vs P11-P13 peak), coinciding with the start of the summer season.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The 'Calista cardigan' is a lightweight knitwear item typically used in shoulder seasons. History shows a clear peak in late Spring (P11-P13, avg demand ~187) followed by a confirmed tapering as summer begins. In Period 17, demand dropped significantly to 121 units, confirming the downward trend noted in previous carry-over insights. Over the last 4 periods (P14-P17), the average demand is 154.5 units, compared to the 180+ averages seen during the May peak. Given the start of June and the sharp drop in P17, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this transition into the lower summer demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current variability as demand levels out. Lead time (L) remains at the reliable promised value of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition to summer regime: Average demand dropped to ~154 units (P14-P17) from the May peak of ~187, with Period 17 showing a sharp decline to 121 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/06/17) occurs during early summer. Historical demand analysis shows a clear tapering from the late-Spring peak (P11-P13 avg: 187) down to a lower, stabilized regime in June. Demand in P17 (121) and P18 (106) confirms this downward shift. Over the last five samples (P14-P18), mean demand has dropped to approximately 144.8 units. Using a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat captures this cooling trend while preventing over-ordering as summer seasonal patterns likely involve lower demand for cardigans. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods. sigma_hat is also calculated over the recent 5 periods to account for the reduction in volatility as the Spring peak subsides.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Average demand has transitioned from the Spring peak (~187) to a lower baseline, averaging ~114 units over the last two periods (P17-P18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Calista cardigan has transitioned into a summer regime. Current demand is significantly lower than the May peak of ~187 units. Over the last three periods (P17-P19), demand has been 121, 106, and 108, averaging ~112 units. This aligns with the seasonal expectation for knitwear as summer arrives (Date: June 24). I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this new lower baseline. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 periods to capture the current reduced volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders concluding in the same period they were placed. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the expected lower summer demand while avoiding excessive holding costs on the 37 units currently on-hand.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The SKU is a 'Calista cardigan' (fine-knit viscose blend), which is typically a transitional or indoor layer. We are firmly in the summer demand regime as noted in Period 19's carry-over. Historical demand for the last four weeks (P17-P20) is 121, 106, 108, and 116, averaging ~113 units. This confirms a significant step down from the May peak (~187). Lead time is stable at 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 20, meaning demand exceeded supply slightly (demand 116 vs on-hand 112). I will set \u03bc\u0302 using a recent window of N=4 to capture this new summer baseline (approx 113 per period). With L=0, the target base stock will be roughly equal to this demand level. Since holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0), the backend naturally targets a 50% service level unless smoothed by sigma; however, given the stability of the recent four weeks, N=4 is appropriate for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to balance the risk of stockouts against the costs of holding a product that is logically entering its low season.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical demand for the Calista cardigan (a lightweight knit) showed a significant Spring peak (avg ~187 units in May) followed by a clear Summer decline (avg ~110 units in late June). Period 21 (July 1st) showed a sudden spike to 151 units, which may be related to early July retail events or clearance but is inconsistent with the broader seasonal trend established since Period 17. To balance service level against holding costs while acknowledging this recent volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 17-21, avg ~120), which bridges the very low June numbers and the recent July 1st spike. L remains at the promised 0 periods as all history confirms same-period arrivals.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (fine-knit cardigan) has transitioned from a stable summer low (~108 units) into a mid-July surge. The last two periods (P21-P22) have shown a significant and consistent increase in demand (151 and 155 units). This likely reflects early 'Back to School' or Autumn transition interest for lightweight knitwear, despite the July date. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this new demand level and mitigate recent stockouts (sold < demand in P20, P21, P22), I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to focus on this new active regime (the last 2-3 periods). I will set N=3 to encompass the start of this upward trend (P20-P22), providing a more responsive forecast than the long-term history.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge detected at Period 21: Demand increased from ~110 to 150+ units/period, suggesting an early Autumn transition or seasonal promotion.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The 'Calista cardigan' is currently experiencing a significant mid-summer demand surge, likely due to pre-autumn transitions or summer clearance events. Since Period 21, demand has risen sharply (151, 155, 173), with the last 3 periods averaging ~160 units. This is a clear regime shift from the early-summer low (avg ~110). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory has been stock-out constrained for the last three periods (sold < demand), indicating the backend's ordering cap is under-budgeting the current surge. To address this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this specific surge regime and ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to minimize lost sales during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Average demand over P21-P23 increased to 159.7 units (approx +45% vs previous 3-period avg of 110), resulting in consecutive stockouts.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Calista cardigan has entered a distinct mid-summer/early-Autumn surge, peaking at 173 units in Period 23 before correcting to 119 units in Period 24. This pattern mirrors the earlier Spring surge. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) is 149.5 units. While Period 24 saw a drop, the preceding three periods (151, 155, 173) suggest a higher baseline than the June summer lull (~110). I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent surge while respecting the most recent downward data point. Sigma_hat is set with N=4 to account for the high volatility observed during this transition (stdev ~24). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Looking at the recent game history for SKU 579541001 (Calista cardigan), demand has fluctuated significantly after the mid-summer surge. Period 24 saw a drop to 119 units, while Period 25 bounced back to 147 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is approximately 149 units. Given the transition into late summer/early autumn, I expect demand to remain elevated but stabilize compared to the volatile July peaks. The Lead Time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recent behavior while smoothing out the volatility observed between P23 and P25. sigma_hat will also be based on these 5 periods to account for the recent variance. This approach aims to minimize stockouts (as seen in P21-P23) while preventing excessive holding costs in the event of another sharp drop like P24.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-August (2019/08/12). A significant mid-summer demand surge was confirmed in carry-over insights at Period 23/24, with demand over the last six periods (P21-P26) averaging approximately 150 units\u2014a notable lift from the early summer baseline (~110). Specifically, P26 demand was 156, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). This suggests the surge is sustained, likely due to pre-autumn transitions or end-of-summer demand for layered knits like this cardigan. To capture this 'New Summer/Pre-Autumn' regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=6 (covering P21-P26). The actual lead time consistently tracks at 0 periods, allowing for 'calculate' to be used. This setup ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand level and helps the OR engine prevent further stockouts while accounting for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand regime confirmed through early August: Average demand over P21-P26 is 150.1 units, significantly higher than the previous June/July baseline (~110 units).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (Calista cardigan) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 21 (early July). Over the last 7 periods (P21-P27), demand has averaged approximately 147 units per period, significantly higher than the previous June baseline. Although Period 27 saw a slight dip to 134 units, the overall trend remains elevated as we move into late August, likely due to early Autumn/Back-to-School interest in knitwear. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high volatility and recent stockouts in this regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this 'Autumn shift' while maintaining a relatively high sigma_hat to protect against further demand spikes. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated average demand while accounting for recent variance.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019/08/26). Recent history (P21-P27) showed a sustained high-demand regime averaging approx. 150 units, attributed to an early Autumn transition or promotional period. However, Period 28 saw a significant drop to 92 units, which is the lowest demand observation since mid-June. This suggests the late-summer/early-autumn surge may be cooling off or stabilizing. Given that the product is a 'fine-knit viscose blend' cardigan, demand is likely to remain relevant as we head into September, but the volatility and recent drop necessitate a more conservative forecast to avoid excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit). I will use a shorter window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent cooling trend (avg ~131) while maintaining a safe stock level, and N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering from late summer peak: Period 28 demand (92 units) is a significant decrease from the P21-P27 average (150 units), suggesting the high-demand regime is ending or stabilizing.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand for the Calista cardigan (a lightweight knitwear item) has entered a new phase following the late summer peak. The average demand over the last two periods (P28-P29) has dropped to 106 units, compared to the P21-P27 average of 150 units. This decline is consistent with a seasonal transition as late summer heatwaves often lead to a lull before autumn demand picks up. Historical data from early 2019 showed a base demand around 90-110 units. Because the most recent demand points (92 and 120) suggest a return to this baseline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward shift (averaging ~115 units), which is safer than the 'default' mean that is inflated by the July/August peaks. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the conclude messages. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition to early-Autumn baseline: Average demand has decreased to ~106 units over P28-P29 from the mid-summer peak (~150), mirroring the late-spring transition and signaling the end of the summer surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30 (Date: 2019/9/2), demand spiked massively to 271 units, representing a 155% increase over the previous week and significantly exceeding all previous peaks. This sharp increase coincides with the beginning of September, typically a high-demand period for knitwear (Calista cardigan) as consumers prepare for autumn. Given the product's lead time of 0 periods, we must respond immediately to this new demand regime to avoid further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). The 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand and sigma will capture the recent baseline and the spike, but to ensure we cover the potential for sustained high autumn demand while balancing the risk of a one-off spike, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (averaging 92, 120, 271) and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to account for the heightened volatility. The backend will use these to calculate a base stock that prioritizes service level for this high-margin-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge detected at Period 30: Demand spiked to 271 units (Date: 2019/9/2), roughly 2.5x the previous 2-week average, signaling a transition to a high-volume autumn regime for knitwear.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579541001' (Calista cardigan) is experiencing a powerful transition into the Autumn season. Period 30 saw a massive demand spike to 271 units (Date: 2019/9/2, likely coinciding with back-to-school or early seasonal shopping), and Period 31 sustained this with 240 units. Both periods resulted in stockouts due to the OR engine's internal ordering caps. The average demand for this new two-period regime is 255.5 units, which is significantly higher than any previous baseline (the highest previous peak was ~187 in May). To capture this surge and prevent further lost sales, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to 256 to reflect the current high-demand reality. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'explicit' and setting it to 50 to account for the potential volatility seen in such sharp seasonal transitions. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (0) as all historical orders have concluded within the same period as placed.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime shift confirmed: Demand surged to an average of 255.5 units over Periods 30-31 (+140% vs late-August baseline), indicating peak seasonality for knitwear in September.

This shift is significant compared to the late-August baseline (~106 units). As we are now in late September (P33), demand remains high but has shown a slight downward trend over the last three weeks (271 -> 240 -> 227). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this specific peak regime while acknowledging the slight deceleration. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the high volatility observed during this seasonal transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late September/early October (Period 34), a peak season for knitwear ('Calista cardigan'). Demand remains in a high-volume autumn regime characterized by high variability. Period 33 saw a massive demand spike to 363 units, significantly exceeding the previous 4-period average (~248). This indicates the peak is deeper than initially estimated or is experiencing secondary surges typical of early autumn weather changes. The OR backend has struggled with stockouts due to tight ordering caps. To adapt, I am shifting to an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the current high-demand baseline (approx 275 units per period) and increasing volatility estimates via a small N for sigma_hat to allow the buffer to expand. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak intensified at Period 33: demand reached 363 units (+46% vs P30-P32 avg), confirming a highly volatile peak-season regime for knitwear in late September.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand Autumn regime for knitwear (September/October), which is characterized by high volatility. Demand peaked at 363 in Period 33 and softened to 265 in Period 34. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 273.2 units, a significant increase from the August baseline. Given the product is a 'soft, fine-knit viscose blend cardigan', it is highly seasonal for the current cooling weather. I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this Autumn surge while allowing the OR backend to account for the high variance (standard deviation is approx 55 units over this period). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, but the system's ordering cap is currently being challenged by the rapid demand shifts, as seen in Period 33's stockout despite ordering 217 units.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime at Period 34: 5-period average (P30-P34) is 273.2 units, confirming a sustained peak for knitwear with high volatility (std ~55).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (Calista cardigan) is currently in its peak Autumn demand regime. Historical demand since Period 30 has been extremely high: P30 (271), P31 (240), P32 (227), P33 (363), P34 (265), and P35 (254). The average demand over these 6 periods is approximately 270 units. This aligns with late September and early October being prime seasons for women's knitwear. Although demand has stabilized slightly from the P33 peak of 363, it remains consistently high and volatile. Given that lead time has remained stable at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture this specific Autumn regime. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during this peak (std ~48 in this regime). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers this high-demand period while accounting for potential spikes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a fine-knit cardigan, which is currently in its peak autumn season (October). Demand escalated significantly starting at Period 30 (September), characterized by a regime shift to an average demand of approximately 265 units over the last 7 periods (P30-P36). Specifically, the last three weeks have shown a slight stabilization/tapering from the absolute peak of 363 (P33), with demand values of 265, 254, and 235. To balance the high service level required for the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level base stock, though the OR backend's capped policy will adjust this for higher safety), I will use a recent_N window for both mean and sigma to capture this high-volume, high-volatility autumn regime. I select N=7 to encompass the entire autumn shift that began in early September. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P30-P36) is sustained with an average demand of ~265 units, though starting to show a gradual downward trend from the late-September peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Calista cardigan is in its peak autumn/winter season. Demand peaked at 363 units in late September (Period 33) and has since stabilized into a high-volume regime, averaging 236.7 units over the last three periods (P35-P37). While slightly tapering from the absolute peak, demand remains strong as we enter late October. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level for this high-volume period while acknowledging the slight downward trend from the late-September peak, I am selecting a 5-period window (N=5) for demand mean and volatility calculation. This window captures the sustained high-demand regime from early to late October (P33-P37) while filtering out the initial September surge, providing a robust localized estimate for the current sales velocity.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the mid-autumn retail season for knitwear. Recent demand remains high but has stabilized from the late September peak (363 units). Average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 246.8 units. The most recent period (P38) saw demand of 259, indicating a slight uptick compared to the trailing average, possibly due to colder weather or early holiday shopping. My objective is to maintain a high service level while balancing holding costs. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized high-demand regime while allowing for the observed volatility (standard deviation across P34-P38 is approx 17).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand has stabilized: Average demand over P34-P38 is 246.8 units, sustaining a high-volume regime significantly above the summer baseline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are moving deeper into the late Autumn/Winter season for knitwear. Period 39 observed a sharp drop in demand to 147 units, compared to the previous 5-period average of ~247 units (approximately a 40% reduction). This follows a sustained high-volume Autumn regime that started in early September. This decline suggests a transition out of the peak September/October surge into a more stable or slightly lower late-year baseline. Since the recent volatility is high and a regime shift is likely occurring (as shown by the P39 drop), I will use a recent window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this downward trend while still respecting the underlying volume. I will maintain a recent window (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the high variability observed during the seasonal transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition identified at Period 39: Demand dropped to 147 units (-40% vs P34-P38 average), suggesting the peak Autumn surge (Sept/Oct) is concluding in favor of a lower late-year baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Calista cardigan has entered a post-peak transition in November. After the high-volume Autumn regime (P30-P38 average ~265), the last two periods (P39-P40) have seen a significant drop to an average of 159 units (147 and 171 respectively). This indicates the end of the peak seasonal surge for this knitwear item. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (encompassing P38-P40) to bridge the transition from high to lower demand, while allowing for some residual late-autumn volume. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility during this regime shift. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak Autumn transition confirmed: Demand has dropped from the ~265 units/period observed in Sept/Oct to an average of 159 units over P39-P40 (-40%), signaling the transition to a lower late-year baseline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (knitwear cardigan) is currently in a post-peak Autumn transition. After the high-volume September/October peak (averaging ~265 units), demand has significantly cooled as we move into late November. Over the last three periods (P39-P41), demand was 147, 171, and 120, yielding a recent average of 146 units. This confirms the transition noted in Carry-over Insights to a lower late-year baseline. Given the product's high seasonality, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this downward shift quickly and avoid excessive holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently healthy (73 units). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent volatility within this lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak transition stabilized: Average demand over P39-P41 (late Nov) is 146 units, a ~45% decrease from the Sept/Oct peak (~265).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (Calista cardigan) is currently in a stabilized post-peak Autumn regime (starting Period 39). Demand has significantly decreased from the September/October surge (avg ~265) to a more moderate level. Over the last four periods (P39-P42), demand values have been 147, 171, 120, and 120, resulting in a mean of 139.5 units. The date is early December (2019/12/2), where demand for lightweight knitwear typically stabilizes or enters a secondary winter baseline before any holiday clearance. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the stability over the last 4 periods, I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this post-transition baseline accurately while ignoring the preceding peak noise. On-hand inventory is 26, and since L=0, the order arriving this period will immediately serve Period 43 demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Calista cardigan is continuing its post-peak transition into the late-year/holiday baseline. Over the last five periods (P39-P43), demand has averaged 125.4 units, with a notable drop to 69 units in the most recent period (P43, 2019-12-02). This indicates a weakening demand regime as the autumn/early-winter peak fully concludes. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the last 5 periods since the major drop at P39) to more accurately reflect the current baseline of ~125 units compared to the higher historical averages. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to capture the current volatility of this new transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition to late-year baseline confirmed: Average demand has decreased to ~125 units over P39-P43 (approx -53% vs Sept/Oct peak), with a further significant softening to 69 units in P43.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Calista cardigan (Knitwear) is in a late-year stabilization phase following the peak autumn surge. Period 44 saw a slight rebound to 105 units from 69 units in Period 43, suggesting the 'softening' was perhaps temporary. The average demand over the last four periods (P41-P44) is 103.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 21 units. With a promised lead time of 0 periods (consistently confirmed by history), and the game nearing its conclusion (Period 45 of 47), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing end-of-game inventory. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current late-season baseline (~103.5 units/period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent variability.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. The SKU is a 'soft, fine-knit cardigan', which aligns with winter demand. Recent demand has shown a late-year stabilization and a slight uptick in Period 45 (136 units). The 'post-peak' regime identified since Period 39 has stabilized. Analysis of Period 43-45 shows demand values of 69, 105, and 136, averaging 103.3 units. However, Period 45 resulted in a stockout (sold 104 vs 136 demand), suggesting that using a slightly longer window (P42-P45) is safer to capture the late-year fluctuations correctly. Mean demand over P42-P45 is 107.5. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm actual lead time remains 0. Re-establishing safety stock is priority after the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Late-year demand for knitwear stabilized around 107 units (P42-P45 avg), showing a slight upward trend in late December likely due to holiday gifting/winter weather.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The 'Calista cardigan' is a knitwear item, which typically sees sustained utility through the winter months. Recent demand (P44-P46) has stabilized around an average of 116 units, reflecting a post-peak holiday baseline. The last two periods (P45-P46) resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), indicating that the current ordering cap/mu_hat is slightly too conservative for the current demand volatility. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5 from P42-P46) to capture this late-year stabilization while increasing sigma_hat using the same window to account for the \ucd5c\uadfc demand spikes that led to stockouts. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.
