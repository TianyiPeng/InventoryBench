{
  "rationale": "The SKU 579541001 is a 'Calista cardigan', a women's fine-knit viscose blend garment. Based on historical data from Jan 7 to Feb 4, the demand has been relatively stable with an average of approximately 102.4 units per week (min 94, max 110). There is a slight downward trend from January into early February (110 -> 94), which aligns with the post-holiday winter retail cycle in the Northern Hemisphere where winter knitwear often begins to see clearance or a slight dip before spring transitions. Given the current date is Feb 11, we are in a standard retail period. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available for the current period's demand (Period 1). Since there is 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1's demand. Based on the Recent History average (102) and recognizing the recent low of 94, I will order 105 units to ensure a high service level while minimizing holding costs (which are equal to the profit per unit).",

Recent 2-week average is ~90, while the full game history average is ~111.

To maximize profit and avoid stockouts during this volatile spring period, I need to cover Period 8 demand. Given the recent spike to 173, I will project demand around 150-160 for Period 8 to capture similar upside while acknowledging that 173 might be an outlier peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 579541001 (Calista cardigan) is currently in a late-year demand regime. Historical data shows that demand typically cools significantly in December. Most recently, Period 43 saw a drop to 69 units, though Period 44 saw a rebound to 105 units (hitting a stockout on 105 starting inventory). This suggests demand is currently fluctuating between ~70 and ~110 units. With Period 45 being mid-December (2019/12/16), we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 47). I need to satisfy demand for the remaining three periods while minimizing ending inventory. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Based on the recent uptick in P44 compared to P43, but considering the lower volume earlier in December and the product's seasonality, a forecast of ~95 units for Period 45 is reasonable. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, I will order 95 units to cover Period 45 demand without overstocking as we approach the final periods.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The Calista Cardigan is entering the late December season (Period 46, Dec 23). Historically, demand for this knitwear item dropped to a winter baseline of ~70 in early December (P43: 69) but has recently surged (P44: 105, P45: 136), likely due to holiday shopping and colder weather. With only 1 period remaining after this one (P47), the goal is to satisfy the current holiday demand while avoiding excess inventory into the final period. The current demand trend (moving from 69 to 136) suggests a peak around Christmas. I will forecast demand for P46 at ~140 units and P47 at ~90 units as post-holiday demand typically cools. With 0 inventory on-hand and a confirmed 0-period lead time, I will order 140 units to cover the immediate period's expected demand and minimize holding costs, especially since any surplus in P46 would incur a $1.00 charge per unit.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a soft, fine-knit cardigan, a seasonal knitwear item. Calendar analysis: Period 47 corresponds to December 30th (the week between Christmas and New Year). This period typically sees a cooldown after holiday gift-giving peaks as the New Year begins. Looking at recent trends, Period 45 saw a demand spike of 136 followed by a drop to 109 in Period 46. Historically, this item had a major peak in autumn (Sept-Oct) and a significant trough in early December (69 units). The late December rally (P44-P46 averaging 116 units) indicates mid-winter activity, potentially due to holiday sales. For Period 47, I expect a further slight deceleration or stabilization as holiday shopping ends. With a lead time of 0 periods, I need to cover Period 47 demand now. Inventory on-hand is 31. Aiming for a target stock level of approximately 105 units ensures coverage of average mid-winter demand while minimizing holding costs for a potentially slow post-holiday week.",
