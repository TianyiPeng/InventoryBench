Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 573085028 (Womens skinny high-waist jeans). There is no history of arrivals yet. The lead time is promised at 0. Historical demand samples show a mean of 61.6 units (74, 54, 54, 58, 68) with a standard deviation of approximately 8.7. Since we are entering the mid-February period, demand is expected to remain relatively stable following the post-holiday lull. The starting inventory is 0, so an order must be placed immediately. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior and the 'calculate' method for lead time to allow the system to adapt as arrival data becomes available. The OR backend will automatically apply the calculated service level (q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95) to minimize stockouts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 77 units (based on promised L=0 and a mean of ~62). The actual demand was 93, resulting in lost sales as we only had 77 units on hand. The observed lead time was 0, matching the promised lead time. The demand history (74, 54, 54, 58, 68, 93) shows an upward trend, especially with the most recent sample of 93 units. Given this is 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim, demand is likely stable but currently under-forecasted. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent higher demand samples (58, 68, 93) plus one earlier sample to avoid over-reacting to a single spike, while maintaining L=0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The item is a staple women's skinny jean. Historical demand shows a mean of 61.6 units (samples: 74, 54, 54, 58, 68). Since the start of the simulation, observed demand has been slightly higher: 93 in Period 1 and 81 in Period 2 (average 87). This suggests a demand regime shift or a higher baseline for this specific period compared to the provided pre-game samples. The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead times for Period 1 and Period 2 were confirmed as 0. I will prioritize the recent demand observations (N=2) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at the default (0) as verified by two consecutive successful same-day deliveries. Holding cost is low relative to profit ($1 vs $19), supporting a robust stock level to avoid lost sales, which occurred in Period 1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: average demand in simulation (P1-P2) is 87, compared to pre-simulation history of 61.6 (+41%). Lead time confirmed as 0 periods for P1 and P2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is women's 5-pocket jeans. In periods 1-2, demand was significantly higher (93, 81) than the pre-simulation average (61.6), but Period 3 saw a drop to 59. Looking at the pre-simulation history for late January/early February, demand fluctuated between 54 and 74. The higher demand in P1-P2 might have been a short-term spike or stock-up. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods for all three simulation periods. Since lead time is 0, the backend base stock covers only the current period (1+L = 1). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to average the simulation demand (93, 81, 59 = ~77.6) and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility, which is higher than the historical baseline. This balances against the moderate on-hand inventory of 42.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Women's Everyday' denim item showed a significant spike in February (Periods 1-2, avg ~87), but has since cooled off significantly in Periods 3 and 4 (avg 50). This suggests the earlier shift was a short-term peak rather than a permanent step-change. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently confirmed by 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently high (66 units) due to the recent demand drop. I am setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the entirety of the simulation data (P1-P4), which balances the high initial demand with the recent low demand, allowing the base-stock calculation to adjust downward while maintaining a buffer against volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: The initial spike (P1-P2 avg 87) retreated in P3-P4 (avg 50), settling near pre-simulation levels (61.6).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/18. Reviewing historical demand for 573085028: Pre-simulation avg was 61.6. In-simulation demand (P1-P5) has been 93, 81, 59, 41, 67 (mean of 68.2). A significant spike occurred in P1-P2 (avg 87) followed by a cooling period (P3-P4 avg 50), with a recent rebound in P5 (67). The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments (P1-P5) have arrived within the same period (actual L=0). On-hand inventory is 40. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the target service level is high (~95%). I will use recent_N=5 to capture the average demand of 68.2 (mu_hat = (1+0)*68.2) and volatility since the start of simulation, as pre-simulation history (Jan/early Feb) appears less representative of current mid-March levels.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product is a staple item (skinny high-waist jeans). Historical demand within the simulation (P1-P6) has been volatile, averaging 64.8, which is slightly higher than the pre-simulation mean of 61.6. Specifically, over the last 4 periods (P3-P6), the mean demand is 53.75 with a standard deviation of 11.5. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently confirmed in every period so far (P1-P6). I will use a recent window of N=4 to reflect the current post-spike demand regime while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the observed volatility. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for (L+1) periods (in this case, 1 period) using these recent statistics.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim SKU showed an initial spike in early February (P1-P2 avg: 87), followed by a stabilization. The simulation demand (P1-P7) average is 63.0, and the last 3 periods (P5-P7) average is 55.7. The pre-simulation history (5 samples) mean was 61.6. There is no clear seasonal trend or event spike evident for April yet based on the garment category (Everyday Collection). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is low (21 units) after a period of lower ordering (P7 ordered 19). I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable regime (avg 53.4 across P3-P7), as the P1-P2 spikes are now outliers. I'll maintain recent_N = 5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This will prompt the backend to order enough to cover the forecasted demand for P8 while accounting for the current on-hand inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's 5-pocket denim jean (everyday collection), which typically shows stable demand but can be influenced by spring transitions in early April. Observations from Periods 1-8 show actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Demand has stabilized after an initial spike: the average demand over the last 6 periods (P3-P8) is 55.3, with individual demands of 59, 41, 67, 48, 52, and 65. This is slightly lower than the pre-simulation average of 61.6 but reflects a consistent 'Everyday Collection' profile. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (5 units) and there is nothing in transit. To prevent a stockout in Period 9, I will use a restricted window of the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which better captures the post-initial-spike equilibrium. The method 'default' for L is used as the promised lead time of 0 is confirmed by historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike equilibrium confirmed: Average demand P3-P8 is 55.3 units/period, down from P1-P2 average of 87.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a staple item (skinny jeans). Historical demand shows an initial spike in February (avg 87) followed by a stabilization in March and April. Looking at the last 6 periods (P4-P9), demand has averaged 52.5 units (41, 67, 48, 52, 65, 42). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all orders placed so far. Since the demand has reached a stable equilibrium after the initial volatility, I will use a recent window of N=7 to capture the demand behavior since the end of the February spike (P3 onwards). This reflects the 'post-spike equilibrium' mentioned in the carry-over insights. I will maintain the lead time at 0 (promised/actual). The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) suggests a high service level is optimal, which the OR backend will handle via the base stock calculation.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 (Women's 5-pocket jeans) has reached a stable demand regime after an initial spike in periods 1 and 2. Since period 3, the average demand has settled at approximately 52.25 units per period (P3-P10), with the last four periods (P7-P10) averaging 50.75. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory health is good, with 27 units on hand. The OR backend will balance the high critical ratio (0.95) for this high-profit ($19) versus low-holding-cost ($1) item. I am choosing N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to encompass the stable period following the initial spike (P3-P10), which provides a stable mean and standard deviation for the current environment.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a staple item ('Madison skinny HW' jeans). Demand has stabilized since Period 3, following an initial spike in February. Over the last 9 periods (P3-P11), the average demand is 52.4 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 9.3 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels are currently low (17 units on-hand), so a standard order is needed to reach the base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this stable post-spike regime, which aligns well with the pre-simulation history (avg 61.6) but reflects the slightly lower recent trend.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 ('Madison skinny HW 5-pocket jeans') experienced a demand surge in Period 12 (88 units), causing a stockout as only 69 units were available. This spike matches the pattern seen in Periods 1-2 (93 and 81 units). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P3-P12) is 55.3, but the last period significantly exceeded this. Given that we are now in early May, we might be seeing a resurgence in demand for 'Everyday Collection' denim. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and prepare for the higher demand volatility seen recently, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation. N=10 captures the post-spike baseline while including the most recent surge to slightly elevate the forecast and safety stock. On-hand is currently 0, so the OR backend will order appropriately to reach the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Sustained lead time of 0 periods confirmed over 12 periods. Demand volatility increased in Period 12 (88 units), reminiscent of the Period 1-2 spike, interrupting the stable Period 3-11 regime (avg 51.6).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's 5-pocket jeans. Current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). We've observed a shift in demand starting around Period 12 (late April). Specifically, Period 12 demand was 88 and Period 13 was 74, which is significantly higher than the stable period (P3-P11 average ~51.6). This suggests a late-spring demand increase or a new higher-volume regime. On-hand inventory is very low (6 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while the OR engine calculates base stock, I will use recent history (N=3) to capture this new upward trend (P11-P13 demand: 53, 88, 74) which averages 71.7 units. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will help the backend respond to this recent surge and volatility while maintaining a high service level appropriate for the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 12: Average demand increased to 81.0 (P12-P13) from previous stable average of 51.6 (P3-P11), representing a 57% increase.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085028' (skinny jeans) shows a volatile demand pattern. Previous carry-over insights identified a new high-demand regime starting Period 12 (Avg 81.0 for P12-P13). However, demand in Period 14 dropped back to 56, which is closer to the older Period 3-11 average of 51.6. We are currently in mid-late May, and jeans often see steady demand before summer transitions. Since the 'regime shift' at P12 has only lasted 3 periods with a significant drop in the most recent period (P14), I will use N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the recent volatility without overreacting solely to the P12 spike. Lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 45. Choosing recent_N for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to prioritize the latest volatility levels over historical averages.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a staple item (washed stretch denim jeans). In Periods 12-13, we observed a significant demand spike (avg 81), but Periods 14-15 have seen demand pull back to a more moderate level (avg 56.5). The earlier 'carry-over insight' from Period 14 regarding a 'new regime' of 81 units now looks more like a transient two-week spike rather than a sustained shift, as the last two periods (56, 57) align closely with the pre-spike average of 51.6 (P3-P11). To balance the potential for continued higher-than-average demand without overstocking during a slowdown, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat. This averages the spike (88, 74) with the recent normalizations (56, 57), yielding a mean forecast of approximately 68.75 units. This covers the 'middle ground' between the old baseline and the recent peak. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085028' has entered a higher-volatility period since Period 12. Initially, demand spiked (P12: 88, P13: 74), followed by a moderate phase (P14: 56, P15: 57), and a sharp drop in Period 16 (34 units). The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 61.8, which aligns closely with the long-term pre-simulation mean, but variance has significantly increased. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the recent volatility while incorporating the lower recent demand point in P16, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the regime change starting P12). This allows the mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current instability and ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for the high-margin product ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) while adjusting to the recent lower demand volume.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 18 (June 10, 2019). Analyzing the demand history, we saw a significant spike in Period 12 (88 units) and Period 13 (74 units), but demand has since sharply declined over the last four periods (P14-P17: 56, 57, 34, 21). The average demand for the last 6 periods (P12-P17) is approximately 55 units, but the most recent two weeks (34 and 21) suggest a significant downward trend as we move further into June. This could be a post-spring seasonal drop for denim trousers. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs given the high ending inventory (75 units) and falling demand, I am using a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and the subsiding demand spike, while acknowledging that the current on-hand inventory is likely sufficient to cover the next period without a large new order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16: Average demand dropped from 81.0 (P12-P13) to 27.5 (P16-P17), a 66% decrease, indicating the end of the spring demand spike.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are in a low-demand regime for this 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim SKU, likely following a spring seasonal peak. The carry-over insights correctly identified a significant drop in demand starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data: Period 16 demand was 34, Period 17 was 21, and Period 18 was 38. The average demand for these last three periods is 31 units, which is significantly lower than the preceding Periods 12-15 (average ~69) and the earlier stable Period 3-11 regime (average ~52). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with the Period 18 order arriving as expected. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to align with this lower demand floor, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order against the high ending inventory of 58 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a pair of skinny jeans, often a year-round staple but subject to seasonal fluctuations. History shows a series of demand regimes: a spring spike (P12-P15), followed by a sharp drop (P16-P17). However, the last two periods (P18-P19) have shown a steady recovery (38 and 50 units respectively) from the seasonal low. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is 35.75, but given the upward trend in the most recent two weeks, using a 4-period window captures the low point while acknowledging the recovery. On-hand inventory is very low at 8 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this potential recovery, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand baseline while accounting for the recent volatility and upward movement in the last two weeks.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. The product is a staple item (high-waist jeans). Following the significant demand drop observed in Periods 16-17 (avg ~27), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P18-P20) at an average of 45 units (38, 50, 47). This suggests a new post-spring equilibrium. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this recent stability while moving past the mid-May/June lows, I am setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recent_N=3 for Period 21 incorporates the demand levels of 38, 50, and 47, providing a \u03bc\u0302 of 45, which aligns with recent customer behavior without overreacting to the deeper June 3rd trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 18: Demand has stabilized at a higher level (avg 45.0) compared to the Period 16-17 low (avg 27.5), following the end of the spring peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1064.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift in levels. Since Period 18, demand has stabilized around a higher mean compared to the low point in Periods 16-17. In Period 21 (last period), demand spiked to 79, which resulted in a stockout. Over the last 4 periods (P18-P21), demand has been: 38, 50, 47, 79, averaging 53.5. Comparing this to the Period 18-20 average of 45, the recent signal suggests a slight upward trend or higher volatility as we move further into July. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts like the one in P21 while acknowledging the unstable mean, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent regime shift (P18-P21), ensuring the system reacts to the higher volume seen in the last period while maintaining a service level justified by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 (Women's 5-pocket jeans) is currently experiencing a significant mid-summer demand surge. Demand in Period 21 was 79 and reached 110 in Period 22, well above the previous stable baseline of ~45 discovered in Period 21. This indicates a new demand regime likely tied to mid-July retail trends. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we stocked out in the last two periods. The lead time is consistently 0. To capture this high-demand phase and prevent further lost sales while maintaining a high service level (Profit $19 vs. Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the acceleration (averaging 78.6 over P20-P22) and set volatility based on these recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift starting Period 21: Demand spiked to an average of 94.5 (P21-P22) from the previous average of 45.0 (P18-P20), a 110% increase, indicating a mid-summer peak.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 (Womens Everyday Jeans) is in a sharp mid-summer demand spike. Demand has surged significantly over the last three periods: P21 (79 units), P22 (110 units), and P23 (141 units). The average for this new regime (N=3) is 110 units, which is much higher than the previous carry-over insight of 94.5. On-hand inventory has been cleaned out (zero ending inventory) for the last three consecutive periods, resulting in substantial lost sales. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I must set mu_hat to cover this peak to stop the stockouts. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this aggressive upward trend while managing the high volatility (sigma_hat also based on N=3). The OR backend's service level logic (q = 19/20 = 0.95) will naturally favor a higher stock position once mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect this surge.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand spike escalated starting Period 21: average demand increased to 110.0 (P21-P23) from 45.0 (P18-P20), a 144% increase, leading to consistent stockouts.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 (Womens Everyday Trousers) experienced a significant mid-summer demand spike starting around Period 21 (July), characterized by three consecutive periods of very high demand (79, 110, 141) and stockouts. However, Period 24 saw a sharp decline to 77 units, which is still higher than the pre-spike average of ~45 but significantly lower than the peak. This suggests the peak of the summer season may have passed, but demand remains elevated compared to June levels. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the behavior of the current high-demand regime (Periods 21-24: 79, 110, 141, 77; Mean=101.75), while allowing the OR backend to react to the recent drop in demand from the 141 peak. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility seen during this summer spike.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand spike (starting P21) showed demand falling to 77 units in P24 after a peak of 141 in P23, suggesting the peak intensity is subsiding but demand remains in a high regime (avg 101.8 vs previous 45).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085028' (Womens Everyday Jeans) is currently in a high-demand mid-summer regime that began around Period 21. After an extreme peak of 141 units in Period 23, demand has tempered but remains elevated compared to earlier spring/autumn levels. The last two periods (P24-P25) recorded demands of 77 and 85, suggesting the regime has stabilized at a higher mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the simulation. I will use the last 5 periods (P21-P25) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current high-demand phase (average 98.4) while acknowledging the recent stabilization below the 141-unit peak. This approach allows the OR backend to maintain sufficient stock for the remaining summer demand while protecting against the extreme volatility seen in Period 23.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (starting P21) stabilized in P24-P25 with an average of 81 units, following a peak of 141 in P23. Overall regime average (P21-P25) is 98.4.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 (Women's skinny jeans) is experiencing a highly volatile mid-summer demand phase. Period 26 saw a massive spike to 177 units, the highest in the history of the simulation, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The demand regime that started in Period 21 has had an average demand of 111.5 units (79, 110, 141, 77, 85, 177). Specifically, the last 3 periods (P24-P26) averaged 113.0 units, but the high variance (std dev ~55) makes a fixed mean dangerous. Given the stockout in P26 and the 0-period lead time, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the recent regime mean plus a buffer for the observed volatility. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this specific high-demand summer window (P21-P26). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (starting P21) reached a new peak of 177 units in P26; regime average (P21-P26) is now 111.5 compared to the pre-regime average of 45.0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3382.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the mid-summer peak (starting Period 21) has exploded significantly. In Period 27, we observed a massive demand spike of 311 units, which is far above the previous regime average of ~112 units. This follows a pattern of high volatility and extreme peaks (P23: 141, P26: 177, P27: 311). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory. Given the date (August 19) and the product (washed stretch denim jeans), we are clearly in a late-summer/back-to-school peak. To avoid further stockouts, I am switching to an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat. I will base it on the most recent demand (311) but tempered slightly as a potential outlier, setting it to 280 units (since Lead Time is 0, mu_hat represents 1 period of demand). I will also use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the extreme volatility (std of the last 7 periods is approx 80). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand explosion confirmed: Demand jumped from 177 in P26 to 311 in P27 (+75%), confirming an extreme high-demand phase for late summer.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 ('Madison skinny HW jeans') is currently experiencing a massive 'Back-to-School' demand explosion, which typically peaks in late August. Demand jumped to 311 in Period 27 and remained very high at 262 in Period 28. Given the date (August 26), we are at the likely apex or just starting the plateau of this seasonal surge. The lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while these high-volume sales are occurring, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current high-demand regime (Periods 26-28 average = 250 units) while accounting for the high volatility observed during this spike. Using N=3 ensures the OR engine prioritizes the current 250+ unit/period reality over historical lower demand averages, ensuring a high service level during this high-profit window.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school peak sustained: Demand in Periods 27-28 averaged 286.5 units, effectively 5-6x the baseline demand (approx. 50).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. We are moving past the late-August 'Back-to-School' peak (which peaked at 311 units in P27 and has since declined to 262 in P28 and 213 in P29). While demand is slowing down, it is still significantly higher than the pre-summer baseline (~50). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P27-P29) is approximately 262 units. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this cooling but still elevated demand level while the OR backend manages the safety stock via sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school peak cooling: Demand declined for two consecutive periods from a peak of 311 (P27) to 213 (P29), indicating the high-intensity phase is passing but remains in a high regime (avg 262 vs summer avg 111).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4117.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for back-to-school (mid-August to early September) has stabilized into a high-demand regime but is beginning to cool off from its peak of 311. The demand in the last four periods (P27-P30) was 311, 262, 213, and 223. This averages 252.25. Given the date (September 9), the 'back-to-school' peak is likely transitioning into a standard autumn baseline, which historically is higher than the spring baseline but lower than the August peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-but-declining demand level (approx. 250 units) while remaining responsive to further cooling. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period plus a safety buffer, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which favors carrying extra inventory to avoid lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand plateaued: Period 27-30 demand averaged 252 units, showing a stabilization after the initially higher peak, but remaining significantly elevated above the summer average of 111.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2414.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Madison skinny HW' (Womens Everyday Collection) has exited its back-to-school peak. After averaging 252 units between P27 and P30, demand dropped significantly in P31 to 137 units. This indicates a transition from the back-to-school surge towards a lower autumn baseline. Given we have 189 units on-hand and lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31: 213, 223, 137) to capture this cooling trend while preventing an over-aggressive order. The current inventory position is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the upcoming period without a large new order, allowing the system to naturally bleed off the surplus from the peak season. L remains at calculate (0) and sigma_hat is set to recent_N (3) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand cooling: Demand dropped to 137 in P31 from a peak average of 252 (P27-P30), indicating a shift towards autumn seasonal levels.

The 'Back-to-School' seasonal peak has clearly concluded. Demand peaked at 311 units in P27 and has trended downward to 92 units in P32. The current demand (P31-P32 average of 114.5) aligns more closely with the summer regime (avg ~111) than the back-to-school peak (avg ~252). I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P30-P32) to capture this cooling trend (average 150) without over-reacting to the single low point of 92, as late September often maintains some level of activity. On-hand inventory is currently high (177) relative to this newer demand level. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. By using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that likely results in a small or zero order this period, allowing on-hand inventory to bleed down and minimize holding costs while the new autumn baseline establishes itself.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School cooling confirmed: Demand dropped for two consecutive periods (137, 92) following the P27-P30 peak (avg 252), signaling a return to pre-peak levels (~100-110).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The 'Back-to-School' peak (P27-P30, avg ~252) has clearly ended. Demand in the last three periods (P31-P33) has averaged 116.7 units (137, 92, 121), which is consistent with the summer regime average (~111) but significantly lower than the preceding peak. Period 34 (Sept 30) transitions into mid-autumn, where we expect demand to stabilize around this new post-peak level. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this cooling trend and stabilize inventory levels, avoiding excess holding costs from the previous high-demand parameters. Given profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level (q = 0.95), which is appropriate given the current regime transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School cooling confirmed: Demand decreased from a P27-P30 average of 252 to a P31-P33 average of 116.7 (-54%), returning to mid-summer baseline levels.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Madison skinny HW' (Womens Everyday Collection) has transitioned from the extreme 'Back-to-School' peak (P27-P30, average ~250) into a stabilized autumn regime. Over the last four periods (P31-P34), demand has averaged 106.3 units (137, 92, 121, 75). This is a significant drop from the peak but aligns well with the mid-summer baseline observed in July (P21-P26 average was 111.5). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for the current regime, I will set mu_hat based on the recent N=4 periods (P31-P34), as this captures the post-peak cooling confirmed in the carry-over insights. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect the current regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School autumn regime confirmed (P31-P34): Demand has stabilized at an average of 106.3 units, down from the peak average of 252 units in late August.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35 (2019/10/07), demand surged to 237 units, which is over double the 'autumn regime' average of 106.3 units observed in P31-P34. This sudden spike caused a stockout (ending inventory 0). The item is '5-pocket jeans in washed stretch denim', a staple item that may experience secondary peaks in mid-October due to seasonal transitions or specific promotions. Given this unexpected volatility and the stockout, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent autumn behavior but include the P35 surge. The lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. The goal is to set a base stock that accommodates this higher volatility and prevents further stockouts while acknowledging the risk that P35 might be an outlier.

Carry-over insight: Unexpected demand surge in Period 35: Demand hit 237 units, a 123% increase over the P31-P34 average (106.3), causing a stockout. Monitoring if this initiates a sustained late-autumn peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a significant late-autumn demand surge. Period 35 saw demand jump to 237, and Period 36 increased further to 282, confirming this is not a one-off spike but a new high-demand regime, likely driven by autumn/winter seasonal transitions for denim. The previous regime (P31-P34) averaged ~106, while the current two-period average is 259.5. Lead time remains stable at 0. To capture this surge and avoid further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to focus exclusively on the latest surge data. I will also use 'recent_N' with N=2 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in these two periods, ensuring the OR backend sets a sufficiently high base stock to handle the peak.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand surge confirmed starting Period 35: Average demand jumped to 259.5 (P35-P36) from the P31-P34 average of 106.3 (+144%).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 ('Madison skinny HW' jeans) is currently in a late-autumn demand surge that began in Period 35. Historically, demand jumped from an average of ~106 (P31-P34) to a peak average of ~259.5 (P35-P36). Period 37 showed a decrease to 153 units, which is significant but still higher than the mid-autumn baseline. Analyzing the calendar (Late October), we are approaching the winter holiday season, which often sees heightened demand for 'Everyday Collection' apparel. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts during this volatile period while minimizing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 (encompassing P35-P37) to capture the current high-demand regime, which averages ~224 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility observed during this surge (demand range: 153-282).

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand surge (starting P35) continues but showed signs of cooling in P37 (153 units). Average demand for P35-P37 is 224.0, significantly higher than the P31-P34 average of 106.3.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is early November (2019/11/04). We are transitioning from the late-autumn/Halloween demand surge observed in Periods 35-36 (avg 259.5) towards a slightly lower but still elevated regime observed in Periods 37-38 (avg 140.5). Historical lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P35-P38) to capture this entire late-autumn volatility phase (average = 200). Using N=4 for sigma_hat as well to ensure the backend accounts for the high variance seen recently (standard deviation of [237, 282, 153, 128] is approximately 75). This approach balances the risk of a late-autumn secondary spike against the potential for an inventory build-up before any winter holiday shifts.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand surge (starting P35) appears to be cooling: Period 37-38 demand averaged 140.5, compared to the initial surge peak of 259.5 (P35-P36).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a post-late-autumn surge period. Demand spiked significantly in Period 35 (237) and Period 36 (282) but has since cooled down and stabilized: P37 (153), P38 (128), and P39 (119). The average demand over the last three periods (P37-P39) is approximately 133.3, which is higher than the early autumn baseline (~106) but much lower than the peak (~260). Given that we are entering mid-November, we should prepare for potential pre-holiday volatility or a stable late-autumn baseline. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this stabilization (average 133.3) and recent_N of 3 for sigma_hat to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the October surge. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-late-autumn surge stabilization: Demand has settled at an average of 133.3 units (P37-P39) following the October peak average of 259.5.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the post-autumn surge period. Demand has consistently decreased over the last four periods (153, 128, 119, 60). The most recent demand (60) is significantly lower than the P37-P39 average of 133.3 units, suggesting a new downward regime shift as we move deeper into November, likely returning toward the long-term baseline (approx 50-60) before any potential holiday spikes. Given the 140 units on-hand and the sharp decline in demand, I am using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this cooling trend (P37-P40 avg = 115) while remaining cautious. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand regime cooling confirmed: Demand dropped from an October peak average of 259.5 (P35-P36) to 115.0 (P37-P40), with the most recent period (P40) hitting 60 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has significantly cooled following the late-autumn surge. Historical demand samples (P37-P41) show units of 153, 128, 119, 60, and 36, confirming a downward trend. The average of the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 99.2, but the most recent two periods (60 and 36) suggest the regime is settling much lower, potentially back to the early spring/summer baseline (~50-60). Given the current Date (Nov 25) and the 144 units on-hand, immediate aggressive replenishment is not required. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the decelerating demand while still providing a buffer for volatility. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-late-autumn surge (P35-P36) demand has shifted to a lower regime; demand in P40-P41 averaged 48.0, returning to early-year baseline levels.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 573085028 (Womens Everyday Jeans) has entered a stable low-demand period following multiple seasonal peaks (mid-summer, back-to-school, and late-autumn). In Period 42, demand was 47 units, and the average for the most recent regime (P40-P42) is 47.7 units. This closely mirrors the early-year baseline of ~50. Current on-hand inventory is 133 units, which is approximately 2.8 periods of the current average demand. Given the high stock level relative to the new low-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to prioritize the most current consumption rate and avoid over-ordering during this cooling phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2527.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), demand spiked to 235 units, a significant jump from the previous 3-period average of 47.7. This follows the historical pattern of seasonal spikes (spring, mid-summer, back-to-school, and late-autumn). Given the date (early December), this is clearly the start of the holiday/Christmas demand surge. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to account for this anticipated high demand, targeting 235 units (matching the P43 surge). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the sudden increase in volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (0) as it has been consistently stable throughout the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed starting Period 43: Demand jumped to 235 units from a previous 3-period average of 47.7 (+393%).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is currently in Period 45 (2019/12/16), which is in the heart of the December holiday shopping season. Demand has surged significantly: Period 43 saw 235 units and Period 44 hit 370 units. This mirrors the 'Back-to-School' explosion seen in late August, where demand peaked around 311 units. Given the Women's Everyday denim product category, high demand is expected to continue through the end of the year. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle this holiday peak, a 'recent_N' approach with N=2 (the start of the holiday surge) is used for mu_hat to capture the current high volume (avg 302.5/period). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility introduced by the transition from low-November to high-December demand. On-hand inventory is currently low (49) after selling 370 units last period, so the system needs to order aggressively to avoid further stockouts in the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand confirmed: December demand jumped from late-November baseline of ~40 to an average of 302.5 in P43-P44 (+650%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $5314.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak Holiday demand season (Period 46, Dec 23). Historical demand for the last three periods (P43-P45) has been 235, 370, and 293 respectively, averaging 299.3. This aligns with the 'Holiday peak demand' insight. As we are at the very end of December, the peak is likely to sustain for one more period (Christmas week) before a sharp decline in January, similar to the pattern seen after the Back-to-School and October surges. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0, I will use an explicit forecast of 300 units for mu_hat (L=0 means mu_hat covers 1 period) to ensure we capture the remaining holiday sales without overstacking for the January drop. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to 70 to account for the high volatility seen in this peak (std of P43-P45 is ~68).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2824.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P43-P46) clearly shows a massive holiday peak for this women's jeans SKU, with demand values of 235, 370, 293, and 162. The peak peaked at P44 (Dec 9) and is now cooling down as seen in P46 (162). Given the current date is Dec 30 (P47), we are entering the post-holiday period where demand typically returns to a lower baseline, though likely still slightly elevated. To capture this transition, I will use a short recent window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to weigh the most recent cooling data (avg 275) more heavily than the peak's start, but I will use a larger sigma_hat window to account for the high volatility observed during December. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak cooling: Demand dropped from a peak average of 302.5 (P43-P44) to 227.5 (P45-P46), indicating the passing of the core Christmas shopping window.
