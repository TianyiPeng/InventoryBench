This is a staple product ('Everyday Collection') with generally stable year-round demand, though it might see slight upticks during seasonal transitions. Calendar Context: Today is Feb 11, 2019. We are moving towards Spring. Historically, demand for the last five weeks has been: 74, 54, 54, 58, 68 (Avg: 61.6). Demand appears relatively stable around the 60s. Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed today should arrive today and be available for today's demand. Current Inventory: 0 on-hand, 0 in-transit. Since L=0, I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately. I will target the historical average plus a small safety margin to account for volatility (average ~62, choosing ~75 for safety). After today's demand, I want to avoid ending with zero stock if demand spikes, but also avoid excessive holding costs ($1/unit). Order Calculation: Estimated demand (62) + safety stock (13) = 75.",

Recent demand sequence: P28=262, P29=213, P30=223, P31=137. The ~40% drop in Period 31 (from 223 to 137) signals the end of the hyper-peak. Historically, the pre-peak 'spring baseline' was roughly 50-60 units. I expect demand to continue its descent toward this baseline as we move further into September. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Inventory on hand is currently 13 units. To cover Period 32 demand while accounting for a\u7ee7\u7eed softening market, I will forecast demand around 100-110 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU '573085028' (Madison skinny high-waist denim) is in the final stage of the holiday retail cycle. Demand peaked in Period 44 (370 units) and has since decelerated (P45: 293, P46: 162). We are now at Period 47 (Dec 30), which historically transitions from the holiday peak back toward the early-year baseline (seen in Feb/Mar as ~60-80 units). Given that the holiday surge is rapidly receding, I expect demand for the coming week to continue its descent, likely landing between 80-120 units as the post-Christmas shopping period concludes. With on-hand inventory at 18 units and a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, I need to order enough to meet this week's demand while avoiding excess stock for the low-demand January period. Ordering 92 units targets a total availability of 110 (18 on-hand + 92 order), which provides a buffer for slightly higher residual holiday demand while minimizing holding costs for the next regime.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand peak for denim has clearly passed, dropping 56% from the P44 peak (370) to P46 (162). Expecting return to Q1 baseline (~60-80) in the coming weeks.",
