Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for SKU 399256001 (Ladies Denim Trousers) shows a significant upward trend in the last week (354 units on 2019-02-04 vs an average of ~253 in the prior 4 weeks). This ~40% increase suggests a shift in demand regime or the start of a seasonal trend. Since we are starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the lead time is promised at 0, we need to order enough to cover Period 1 demand. Using the most recent sample (354) as the mean (mu_hat) for the current (1+L) period is prudent to avoid stockouts during this apparent growth phase. Sigma will be set to a value reflecting recent volatility to maintain a healthy service level.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', a staple ladies' denim item. Looking at the demand history, there is a clear upward trend: January saw demand between 240-269, but the first two weeks of February jumped significantly to 354 and then 414 in Period 1. This suggests a seasonal shift as spring fashion demand begins to ramp up in mid-February. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the speed of replenishment. However, we stocked out in Period 1 (sold 392 of 414 demand), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory. Given the strong momentum (240 -> 251 -> 252 -> 269 -> 354 -> 414), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent acceleration in demand while ignoring the lower January baseline. For mu_hat, N=3 averages the last three periods (269, 354, 414 \u2248 345), but since demand is actively growing, I will use 'explicit' to set a slightly higher forecast of 430 for the upcoming period to prevent further stockouts during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand growth detected starting Feb 2019: demand increased from Jan average (~250) to 354 (Feb 4) and 414 (Feb 11), indicating a spring seasonal ramp-up.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256001' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is showing a sustained increase in demand as we move into the spring season. Historical demand in January averaged ~253, but the last three observations (Feb 4: 354, Feb 11: 414, Feb 18: 399) show a shift to a higher regime averaging ~389 units/week. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been confirmed in both Period 1 and Period 2 (orders arrived same-period). Given the high demand and the risk of stockouts (evident in Period 1 where sales were limited by inventory), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture this 'spring ramp-up' regime correctly. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains at the default (0).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256001' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is entering March, a period typically associated with the spring fashion ramp-up. Historical data and recent game history show a clear demand surge: January averaged ~253 units, but February demand grew significantly (414, 399, 321), averaging ~378 units despite the dip in the final week of February. Given the promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0, the environment is highly responsive. We have 95 units on hand. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (representing the February trend) to capture the higher volume compared to January. Sigma_hat is also calculated over these 3 samples to account for the increased volatility of the seasonal pivot. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the immediate demand plus a safety buffer for the spring season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $814.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of ladies' denim ankle-length jeans. Demand history shows a peak in early February (414) followed by a gradual stabilization back toward the 250-325 range (399, 321, 247). The most recent period (P4) showed a significant drop to 247, returning to January levels. Combined history [240, 251, 252, 269, 354, 414, 399, 321, 247] suggests the 'spring ramp-up' noted in P2 may have reached a localized peak. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent window (N=5) to balance the high early-Feb demand with the more recent cooling, ensuring we don't over-order if the trend continues downward, while maintaining enough stock for a 1-period lookahead (L+1=1). Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18, 2019. Historical demand shows a peak in mid-February (414 units) followed by a cooling trend through March (averaging 246 units over the last two weeks). This SKU (Ankle-length jeans) is a spring fashion item; the February peak likely represented initial spring collection interest, and demand is now stabilizing at a lower, more consistent level. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 periods across all five recorded operations. My strategy is to shift focus to the most recent demand regime (last 4 periods: 399, 321, 247, 245) while recognizing that the earlier February peak was an outlier compared to current consumption. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat will smooth out the extreme high (414) while capturing the recent stabilization around 250-300 units. I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to include the variability of the transition from the peak to the current stable state to ensure a safe buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized after a mid-February peak. The last three periods (P3-P5) show stable demand averaging ~271 units, compared to the P1-P2 average of ~406 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product is a staple item (Ladies Skinny Ankle Jeans). Analysis of the last 4 periods (P3-P6) shows a stable demand regime after the mid-February peak, with demand values of 321, 247, 245, and 265. The average of these last 4 periods is approximately 270 units. This suggests the initial spring ramp-up has leveled off. The lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand level while ignoring the higher volatility from the February spike. With profit ($4) being four times the holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~80% cycle service level), which is appropriate for this SKU.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, demand increased to 331 units, which exceeded the total inventory (on-hand + arriving), resulting in a stockout (sold=300, ending inventory=0). This indicates a potential uptick in demand as we enter April. The last three periods (P5, P6, P7) had demands of 245, 265, and 331, averaging approximately 280. However, the most recent demand (331) is significantly higher than the previous stabilization point (~271) mentioned in Carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase while maintaining responsiveness to the stockout event. Setting L to default (0) as lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1096.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are managing 'Ankle-length jeans'. Looking at the demand history, we saw a stabilization around 250-265 in Periods 4-6, but demand increased again to 331 in Period 7 and 283 in Period 8. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is approximately 274.2. The 'Skinny Ankle' product is highly relevant for the spring season, and we are currently in April, which suggests demand will remain at this higher level or potentially increase. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent demand level, which helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the expected 275-300 units while accounting for the recent variability (sigma). On-hand inventory is low (36), so the policy will trigger a substantial order to meet the anticipated spring demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Average demand increased from ~255 (P4-P6) to ~307 (P7-P8), likely reflecting peak spring seasonality for ankle-length denim.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are in mid-spring, typically a strong period for ankle-length denim. Reviewing the recent demand history: Period 7 (331), Period 8 (283), and Period 9 (201). While Period 9 showed a drop for the first time in three weeks, the preceding trend suggested a regime shift toward higher spring volume (~300 units). The dip in Period 9 might be a normal fluctuation or the start of a decline, but given the product type (ankle-length jeans) and the date, we should maintain a robust stock level for the remainder of April. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent spring demand levels (average 271.6), and recent_N of 3 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (std ~65.5). This approach balances the risk of overstocking following the P9 dip while ensuring we can meet demand if it rebounds to P7 levels.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. This product is 'Skinny Ankle' denim, which typically sees high demand in early spring (March/April) and tapers off as late spring and summer approach. Recent demand history confirms this: Period 7 peaked at 331, but demand has since dropped significantly over the last three periods (283, 201, 130). The demand of 130 in Period 10 is the lowest in the recorded history and suggests that the spring peak has passed and we have entered a lower demand regime or post-peak lull. Lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is currently at 197 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand of 130. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this sharp downward trend (average of 283, 201, 130 is 204.6) while maintaining a buffer to prevent overstocking as the season transitions. Setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples reflects this immediate decline better than a longer average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: Spring peak has ended, with demand dropping from a Period 7-9 average of 271 to 130 in Period 10 (-52%).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Skinny Ankle' denim item shows a clear peak in February and March, followed by a significant decline throughout April. Period 10 recorded 130 units and Period 11 recorded 173 units, confirming a shift to a lower-demand post-peak regime (averaging ~150) compared to the March average (~280). With a promised lead time of 0 (L=0) consistently confirmed by history, we need to set parameters based on this new lower-demand level. I am using recent_N (N=2) to capture the demand drop in Periods 10 and 11, while maintaining a slightly higher volatility estimate via recent_N (N=5) to protect against the variance seen in the recent transition, as the item's profit profile ($4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost) suggests a stockout is more costly than carrying small amounts of inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear regime shift. After the spring peak ended in Period 10 (130 units), demand has been trending upwards again: Period 11 (173 units) and Period 12 (227 units). This indicates a post-Easter recovery or a shift into late-spring/early-summer demand for ankle-length denim. The current on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 12. Although the recent_N method would average these disparate numbers (130, 173, 227), an explicit forecast is preferred to capture the immediate momentum and return the system to a base stock that supports the current demand level of ~220-230 units. Lead time is consistently 0. Setting mu_hat to 230 to align with the most recent week's demand, and sigma_hat to 48 (the standard deviation of the last 3 periods, scaled for L=0) to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed post-Period 10: Demand increased from 130 (P10) to 227 (P12), moving average currently ~177 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256001' (Skinny Ankle Denim) is currently in a recovery phase following a sharp drop in demand in Period 10. Since Period 10 (130 units), demand has sequentially increased or stayed relatively high: P11 (173), P12 (227), and P13 (223). The average demand over the last three periods (P11-P13) is approximately 208 units. Given the seasonality of ankle-length jeans in mid-May, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly increase as summer approaches. The lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-slump stabilization and set L to 'default' (0). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current demand level of ~210 units per period while maintaining a safety stock appropriate for the recent volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399256001 (Ladies Skinny Ankle Denim) shows a volatile spring season. Following a severe dip in Period 10 (130 units), demand has been steadily recovering: P11 (173), P12 (227), P13 (223), P14 (251). The average of the last 4 periods is approximately 219. Given the on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time is consistently 0, we need to set base stock to cover expected demand and a safety buffer. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1) implies a target service level of 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current recovery trend while avoiding the noise of the very low Period 10 or the high early spring peaks. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend sustained for 4 periods following the P10 low; moving average stabilized at ~219 units (+68% from P10).

Daily Reward (R_t): $988.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans, which is a seasonal spring/early summer item. Analysis of recent demand shows a clear recovery and stabilization trend after the Period 10 low (130). Demand over the last five periods (P11-P15) has been 173, 227, 223, 251, and 267, showing a consistent upward trend. The moving average for the last 3 periods is 247 units. Ending inventory has been 0 for the last two periods (P14, P15), indicating that demand is currently outstripping the stock levels set by the OR engine's default logic. In fact, sold units were capped by starting on-hand inventory in P12, P14, and P15. Lead time is consistently observed at 0. Therefore, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent growth trend and ensure high availability (z* = 0.84 based on a 4:1 profit/holding ratio) to capitalize on the late spring/early summer demand before the typical summer clearance dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend sustained for 5 periods following P10 low; moving average for P13-P15 reached 247 units (+90% from P10). Stockouts occurred in 3 of the last 4 periods, suggesting the backend default parameters are undershooting current demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early June. Recent historical demand (P12-P16) has shown a significant recovery from the mid-April low, with demand figures of 227, 223, 251, 267, and 223. The average over these last 5 periods is 238 units. While demand stabilized in Period 16 compared to the peak in Period 15, on-hand inventory remains low (43 units) and the system has experienced three stockouts in the last five periods (P12, P14, P15), indicating that the OR engine's default parameters (based on the full history including the 130-unit dip) are too low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat (average 238) to capture this current sustained performance while allowing for slight stabilization. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at ~238 units (P12-P16) following the post-April recovery, representing a stable late-spring/early-summer level.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans has recently dropped significantly to 160 units in Period 17, following a plateau of approximately 238 units between Periods 12 and 16. This decrease of approximately 33% from the previous period's demand (223) and even more from the P15 peak (267) suggests the transition from the spring/early-summer peak into a lower-demand mid-summer phase. Actual lead time remains consistently confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this apparent downturn, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to prioritize the most recent data points (including the P17 drop and the preceding plateau), which is more representative of the current regime than the full history or the volatile spring months. This will help the OR backend lower the target base stock to align with the current lower demand level and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand decline detected at Period 17: demand dropped to 160 units, a ~33% decrease from the previous 5-period average (~238), indicating a move away from the late-spring plateau.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399256001 (Ladies Ankle Denim) is currently in a mid-summer cooling phase. Post-April growth peaked in late May and has since declined for two consecutive periods: P17 (160) and P18 (140), a significant drop from the P12-P16 average of ~238. This aligns with the seasonal transition out of peak spring fashion into mid-summer. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the consistent decline over the last two weeks, I am targeting a mu_hat based on the most recent demand regime (last 2-3 periods) to avoid overstocking and high holding costs in a declining market. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) captures the current downward trajectory (approx 174 mean including the end of the previous plateau), while N=2 (150 mean) would be more aggressive. I will use N=3 to provide some buffer against volatility while acknowledging the downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand decline confirmed: P17-P18 demand (avg 150) represents a ~37% decrease from the P12-P16 late-spring plateau (avg 238).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical demand for this ankle-length denim SKU shows a clear downward trend consistent with a mid-summer decline. After a late-spring plateau averaging ~238 units (P12-P16), demand has dropped over the last three periods: 160 (P17), 140 (P18), and 113 (P19). This represents a sustained regime shift. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent decline (averaging ~138 units) and avoid over-ordering during the summer low season. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand decline is sustained for 3 periods (P17-P19), with demand decreasing from ~238 to an average of 138 units (-42%).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for ankle-length denim (SKU 399256001) has continued its downward trajectory as we enter July (Period 21). We have observed four consecutive weeks of declining demand: 160, 140, 113, and 70. This confirms a significant shift from the late-spring plateau (~238) to a summer low. The average demand across the most recent 4 periods (P17-P20) is 120.75 units. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the sharp drop to 70 in the most recent period, using a recent window (N=4) for mu_hat will help the OR engine align with this lower demand regime while protecting against volatility. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture the current variance. With on-hand inventory at 88, a lower mu_hat will naturally reduce new orders to avoid overstocking during this slow period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 confirmed: Summer low established with demand declining for 4 consecutive periods; P17-P20 average is 120.75 units (-49% from previous regime).

Since Period 17 (early June), demand has dropped significantly from the spring plateau (~238) to a new low-level regime. The last five periods (P17-P21) show demand values of 160, 140, 113, 70, and 99. This represents a downward trend that stabilized at an average of roughly 116 units over the last five weeks. I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and prevent excessive holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently 55 units. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' is currently in a summer cycle. After a significant decline from late spring levels (~238 units), demand established a summer low between Periods 17-20 (average ~120 units). However, the last two periods (P21 and P22) have shown a steady recovery (99 and 155 units respectively), suggesting the start of a late-summer/pre-fall trend or a clearing event. Period 22 resulted in a stockout (demand 155 vs 146 available), indicating that current parameters based on the summer low are now too conservative. To capture this upward movement while protecting against overstocking on a volatile turnaround, I will shift the focus to the most recent 3 periods (P20-P22) to set my demand forecast. This weights the recent increase more heavily than the deep summer lows of June. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery from summer low confirmed at Period 22: Demand increased from 70 (P20) to 155 (P22), representing a 121% increase over two weeks; stockout in P22 suggests a regime shift upward.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256001 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently experiencing a demand recovery phase following a summer low. Demand has increased from a low of 70 units (P20) to 155 (P22) and 160 (P23), leading to consecutive stockouts in P22 and P23. The inventory for both periods was completely exhausted (on-hand 0), indicating that the actual demand likely exceeded the recorded sales. To capture this upward trend and prevent further stockouts, I am using a recent_N approach. I will set mu_hat based on the last 2 periods (P22-P23) where demand averaged 157.5 units, though likely higher due to truncation. Given the volatility of the recovery and previous stockouts, I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to allow for a higher safety buffer. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend sustained: P22-P23 demand average (157.5) is +125% higher than the P20 low (70), with consecutive stockouts confirming the shift.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019-07-22 (Period 24) dropped significantly to 59 units, following a brief recovery in Periods 22 and 23 (155 and 160 units). This suggests that the 'recovery' was either a brief spike or that we are now entering a highly volatile late-summer period. The 'carry-over' for Period 24 noted a recovery trend, but the latest data point (59) contradicts a sustained upward regime. However, given that Period 22 and 23 experienced stockouts (demand was likely higher than sales), the 59 in Period 24 might be a low-side outlier or the start of a new downturn. To balance the risk of further stockouts seen in Periods 22-23 against the very low Period 24 demand, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat. This averages 155, 160, and 59 (~125 units), which provides a buffer against the previous stockouts while acknowledging the recent drop. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399256001 (Ankle-length jeans) is showing high volatility recently. After a significant recovery trend (P22-P23 avg: 157.5), the last two periods have seen a sharp decline (P24-P25 avg: 74.5), suggesting that the 'late summer recovery' may have been a brief spike rather than a sustained regime shift. The current date is August 5th, which is typically a transition period in retail between summer clearance and autumn arrivals. Given the recent drop from 160 to 59 and then 90, the previous 'recovery' insight is no longer dominant. I will use a recent window (N=4) to capture the current volatility while dampening the impact of the brief July spike. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit ($4) vs Holding Cost ($1) suggests a target service level of 80% (q=0.8), which the OR backend will calculate based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late July/early August: after a brief spike to 155-160 (P22-P23), demand dropped to an average of 74.5 in P24-P25 (-53%), indicating the 'recovery' was not sustained.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256001' (Skinny Ankle Denim) is experiencing high demand volatility in late summer. After a significant drop in P24-P25 (averaging 74.5 units), demand in P26 rebounded to 131 units, suggesting a potential early fall ramp-up or just high weekly variance. Current on-hand inventory is low at 27 units. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). The lead time is consistently 0. To capture the recent volatility and potential upward shift while remaining cautious of the erratic pattern observed since July, I will use a recent_N of 5 periods (P22-P26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window averages the high recovery spike (155-160), the subsequent crash (59-90), and the most recent rebound (131), providing a balanced estimate of the current regime's mean (~119 units) and its significantly increased variance.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late August (2019/8/19), which typically marks the start of the 'Back to School' or 'Fall' denim ramp-up. Recent demand has confirmed another growth phase: Period 26 demand was 131 and Period 27 demand was 174, both significantly higher than the late July/early August average of ~75. A stockout occurred in Period 27 (sold 156 vs 174 demand), reinforcing that demand is trending upward. I am setting a new demand regime starting at Period 26 (N=2) to capture this recovery. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to reflect the latest spike and forecast a demand of around 153 per period. I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility observed during this transition phase, setting it slightly higher than recent standard deviation to protect against more stockouts during this ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: New demand recovery trend detected starting Period 26: demand increased from 90 (P25) to 131 (P26) and 174 (P27), indicating the start of the late-summer/fall denim season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' is entering the late-summer/early-fall season (late August). Demand has shown a clear recovery trend over the last three periods, rising from 90 (P25) to 131 (P26), 174 (P27), and stabilizing at 176 (P28). This aligns with the seasonal transition for denim. Average demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) is 160.33 units. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent increase without being overly influenced by the summer lows or the brief volatility in July. Lead time is consistently 0. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand recovery confirmed: P26-P28 demand average is 160.3 units, a 115% increase from the P24-P25 average of 74.5.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

The current date is September 2, 2019. Historical data confirms a late-summer/fall denim recovery began around Period 26 (August 5). Demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 131, 174, 176, and 167, averaging approximately 162 units. This is a significant and sustained increase from the July lows (~80 units). Lead time is consistently 0. I will set the demand forecast based on this recent 4-period regime (recent_N=4) to ensure the OR backend captures this recovery while maintaining a high service level for the fall season. Sigma_hat will also use the recent 4-period window to reflect current volatility during this transition.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak fall denim season (September). Recent demand history from Period 26 to Period 30 shows a clear recovery trend with an average demand of approximately 169 units (131, 174, 176, 167, 197). Period 30 experienced a stockout (demand 197, sold 180), indicating that the default parameters are under-ordering relative to the current upward momentum. To capture this growth, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to prioritize the most recent 5-period average (~169) and current variance. Lead time is consistently 0 as shown in all 'conclude' messages, so I will maintain the default lead time setting.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim season momentum confirmed: P26-P30 demand average reached 169 units, culminating in a stockout at P30 (demand 197).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019, which is squarely in the fall denim season. Recent demand from Period 26 to Period 31 has shown a clear upward trajectory: 131, 174, 176, 167, 197, and 232 units respectively. This represents a sustained growth regime. The last two periods resulted in stockouts (Period 30 and 31), where actual demand (197 and 232) exceeded the starting inventory (180 and 190). The average demand over the last 6 periods (the current regime) is approximately 179.5 units, but the most recent sample of 232 indicates momentum is still building. Given the persistent stockouts and seasonal context, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this regime while allowing the backend to calculate the appropriate base stock for a high-service-level requirement (Profit/Holding ratio of 4:1). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim season momentum intensified in Period 31: demand reached 232 units, marking the second consecutive stockout and a 30% increase over the P26-P30 average (169).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256001' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in its fall seasonal peak, which began around Period 26 (early August). Recent demand observations show a sustained high level: P30 (197), P31 (232), and P32 (195). Although demand slightly dipped in P32 compared to P31, the three-period average is approximately 208 units, significantly higher than the earlier seasonal average. Two stockouts in P30 and P31 confirm that the previous ordering levels were insufficient to meet this fall surge. Inventory is currently low (13 units on-hand), and lead time remains stable at 0. To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I am selecting a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~208). I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the volatility associated with the start of the fall season, ensuring the safety stock is responsive to the current trend without over-reacting to single-period fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim season plateau: Demand has stabilized at a high level following the initial August surge, with a P30-P32 average of 208 units (+24% over the early-recovery average of 169).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399256001 (Ladies Denim Trousers) has shifted significantly upward in the last period, jumping from ~200 units to 317 units, resulting in a stockout. This surge correlates with late September, a peak period for fall denim sales. The last 4 periods (P30-P33) show a clear upward trend (197, 232, 195, 317) with an average of 235.25. Given the stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods, it is evident that the standard demand estimation is too low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this intensified fall momentum for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current 250-300+ unit demand regime. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim season momentum intensified significantly in Period 33: demand reached 317 units (+62% over the P30-P32 average of 208), confirming a powerful late-September peak and resulting in the 3rd stockout in 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256001 (Ladies Denim Ankle jeans) is currently in its peak 'fall season' regime. Recent demand history shows a significant escalation: P30 (197), P31 (232), P32 (195), P33 (317), and P34 (259). This results in a 5-period average of 240 units. Despite frequent stockouts, the current on-hand inventory is very low (25 units). The date is October 7, which typically marks the height of autumn retail demand for denim. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this high-demand regime (avg ~240). Given the lead time is confirmed at 0 but volatility is high (standard deviation of these 5 periods is ~49.8), I will set sigma_hat explicitly to 60 to provide a slightly more aggressive buffer against further spikes, ensuring the base stock level targets approximately (1+0)*240 + z*60. This approach balances the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) which favors higher service levels.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim season peak confirmed: Period 30-34 average demand is 240 units, a 42% increase over the previous August plateau (~169). Consistent stockouts (3 in the last 5 periods) validate the sustained high-demand regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The fall denim season peak (identified starting around Period 30) appears to be stabilizing. Demand in the last two periods (P34: 259, P35: 218) has moderated from the Period 33 peak of 317, though it remains significantly higher than the August average. The 5-period average (P31-P35) is approximately 244 units. However, consistent with the cooling trend seen in P34-P35, I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering P30-P35) to capture the full current high-demand regime while acknowledging the recent slight decline to avoid excessive overstocking as we move further into October. Lead time remains stable at 0. mu_hat will use recent_N=6 to reflect this current regime mean (approx 240), and sigma_hat will use the same window to capture the high volatility seen during these peak weeks.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in the 'Fall denim season' peak. Over the last 4 periods (P33-P36), demand has averaged approximately 257.5 units (317, 259, 218, 236). While there was a significant spike in P33 (317 units), the subsequent three periods have shown a stabilization between 218-259 units. The 40 units remaining on-hand at the start of P37, combined with the zero in-transit balance, indicates the system is currently keeping up but with thin margins. Given the consistency of the last 4 periods post-spike, I will use recent_N with N=4 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current stabilized high-demand regime while moving past the single highest outlier (P33) to prevent excessive holding costs as we approach late October. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim season plateau confirmed: Following the P33 peak (317), demand has stabilized over 3 periods (P34-P36) at an average of 237.7 units, indicating a persistent high-volume regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256001' (skinny ankle jeans) is currently in a stable fall plateau at Period 38 (late October). Demand over the last four periods (P34-P37) has been consistent, with values of 259, 218, 236, and 236, resulting in a mean of 237.25 and a low standard deviation of approximately 16.7. This follows the significant peak of 317 in Period 33. The previous 'carry_over_insight' from Period 37 correctly identified this plateau. Based on this stability, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this specific regime's mean and variance. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period), so L is set to default. This approach ensures the base stock reflects narrow, recent volatility and a stable demand mean, optimizing the balance between avoiding stockouts and minimizing holding costs for the current 58 units on hand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256001' (Skinny Ankle Denim) is in a high-demand fall regime. Period 38 saw demand of 197 units, which is a slight softening from the peak seen in late September (P33-P34) but remains high compared to summer levels. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) is 229 units, confirming a plateau around the 230-240 range identified in the Carry-over Insights. As of Period 39 (Nov 4), we are entering the pre-holiday season. Historical lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-demand plateau while slightly weighting against the extreme peak of P33. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the current volatility in this high-demand phase. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for high-demand periods without over-ordering based on the older, lower-demand summer data.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this SKU has been in a high-sustained fall/winter regime since late August. Over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), demand has been stable, averaging 221.8 units (218, 236, 236, 197, 222). There is no immediate evidence of a pre-holiday spike or a seasonal drop-off yet, but we are entering the mid-November period which often precedes holiday volatility. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current stable plateau of ~222 units, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This keeps the base stock aligned with the most recent month of sales data, ensuring we cover demand while maintaining a healthy buffer for potential pre-holiday variance without over-ordering during a stable period.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a high level for the mid-fall season: Period 35-39 average demand is 221.8 units, showing high stability compared to the volatile September peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the mid-fall to late-fall denim season. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (P35-P40) has been remarkably stable, with an average of 221.5 units and a small standard deviation compared to previous high-volatility periods. No major holiday spikes are expected in the immediate next week for this product category (ladies ankle-length denim), so the current plateau is the best predictor. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. To maintain the 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture this stable fall plateau regime while excluding the more volatile September peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256001' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a stable mid-to-late fall demand regime. Over the last seven periods (P35-P41), demand has consistently hovered between 197 and 236 units, with an average of 219.7 units. This represents a normalization after the volatile late-September peak. The most recent demand (P41) was 209 units, which aligns with the recent 5-period average of 216.8 units. Although we are approaching late November (Black Friday/Cyber Monday timing), the historical data for this specific product doesn't yet show a pre-holiday surge. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the backend's target service level is 80%. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain optimal stock for this stable regime, I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the stability of the last 7 periods (P35-P41) while smoothing out the earlier Sept peak volatility.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), we observed a massive demand spike to 467 units, resulting in a complete stockout. This timing coincides with Black Friday/Cyber Monday week, a major retail event. While previous periods (P35-P41) were stable around 220 units, this spike is a significant outlier that requires an immediate inventory response to capture the remaining holiday sales momentum. Since on-hand inventory is now 0, I will set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 400 to ensure the backend orders enough to bridge the gap between the pre-spike plateau (~220) and the recent peak (467), while acknowledging that post-Black Friday demand may settle slightly lower but still above the seasonal norm. Sigma_hat is also increased via 'explicit' to 100 to account for higher volatility during the December shopping period. Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme holiday demand spike detected in Period 42 (demand 467), more than doubling the previous 7-period average (~220), confirming a Black Friday seasonal impact.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9). Period 42 saw a massive Black Friday spike (467 units). Period 43 demand dropped significantly to 181 units, which is consistent with the post-promotion lull and a return toward the mid-fall plateau (~220 units). Current on-hand is high (304 units) due to the large order from the previous period attempting to chase the P42 spike. Given the product is 'Ankle-length jeans', demand is likely to remain stable or slightly decrease as deep winter sets in, before any potential end-of-year clearance or holiday gifting. I will target the stable mid-fall average (P35-P41 avg \u2248 220) to avoid overstocking while holding high inventory. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat (N=4 captures the return to normalcy after the P42 outlier) and sigma_hat to account for the recent extreme volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday demand (P43: 181 units) confirms a return to pre-spike levels. The huge spike in P42 (467) was a transient event. Inventory levels are currently high due to response to that spike.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in the post-holiday, mid-December period. Period 42 saw a massive Black Friday demand spike (467 units), followed by a return to baseline. The last two periods (P43-P44) show demand of 181 and 205 units, averaging 193. This is consistent with the pre-holiday stable regime (P35-P41 average was ~220). Currently, on-hand inventory is 177 units. Given the transition toward late December and the end of the game (Period 47), I will target the stable fall/winter mean of ~210 units. Lead time remains solidly 0. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the post-peak stabilization while ignoring the transient P42 outlier. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. Historical data confirms that the massive spike in Period 42 (Nov 25) was a transient Black Friday event, with demand returning to a stable range. Over the last three periods (P43-P45), demand has averaged 190.3 units (181, 205, 185), which aligns with the pre-spike fall plateau (~220 units). As we are now in the week of Christmas, demand for this item (ankle-length denim) typically remains stable or decelerates slightly before the January sales. On-hand inventory is currently 172 units. The promised lead time is 0 and has been consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the high variance from the Black Friday spike while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current stable regime, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the post-spike stabilization. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~190 unit demand level rather than the extreme mean/standard deviation caused by the P42 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday stabilization confirmed: Period 43-45 demand average is 190.3 units, indicating a return to the pre-Black Friday stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $538.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, following the holiday season. Historical analysis shows that after the transient Black Friday spike in Period 42 (467 units), demand has stabilized in a post-holiday regime. The last four periods (P43-P46) show demand figures of 181, 205, 185, and 148, averaging ~180 units. This suggests a seasonal cooling as we enter the end of the year and transition into January, which earlier data (Jan 2019) suggested was around 240-260 units. To balance the holding cost of the current 54 units on-hand with the risk of stockout, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent post-peak stabilization while allowing for the expected seasonal return to baseline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regime (Late Dec): Demand has stabilized at an average of 180 units (P43-P46) following the Black Friday spike, representing a 19% decrease from the mid-fall average of ~222.
