Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical order arrival data to infer anything other than the promised lead time of 0. The demand history shows a steady upward trend: 101, 101, 117, 123, 157. This suggests a pattern of increasing demand as we move deeper into February, possibly due to seasonal transitions in the 'Womens Everyday Collection'. Given only 5 data points, using all of them (recent_N=5) captures the current mean (119.8) and volatility. With L=0, mu_hat will be (1+0) * mean of last 5, and sigma_hat will be sqrt(1+0) * std of last 5. This approach balances the need to stock up for the increasing trend while acknowledging the limited sample size.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Luna skinny RW', a women's 5-pocket jeans SKU. The historical demand shows a clear upward trend from early January (101) to the most recent observation in Period 1 (150). Specifically, the last three weeks were 123, 157, and 150. Based on the date, we are approaching late February, where apparel demand often stabilizes or grows slightly as spring collections gain traction. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0 (order arrived same period). However, at the end of Period 1, we had 0 inventory and missed 10 units of demand (demand=150, sold=140), so we need to ensure the base stock covers the current trend plus a safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent jump from ~100 range to ~150 range, and N=5 for sigma_hat to provide a stable volatility estimate. Lead time (L) remains 0 as confirmed. The backend OR logic will calculate base_stock using these parameters to target the optimal service level.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 (Women's Skinny Jeans) shows a clear and significant upward demand trend in early 2019. Historical samples increased from 101 to 157. During the first two game periods (Feb 11 and Feb 18), actual demand was 150 and 177, respectively. In both periods, the system stocked out (ending inventory = 0, units sold < demand) because demand exceeded the on-hand units provided by the OR backend. The actual lead time is 0 periods, as confirmed by 'arrived=X (ordered on Period N, lead_time was 0 periods)'. To capture the upward momentum and prevent further stockouts, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat (averaging the most recent samples: 157, 150, 177) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This will increase the base stock level to better meet the rising demand for this seasonal staple.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean weekly demand has increased from ~110 in Jan to ~160+ in Feb (+45%), leading to stockouts in P1 and P2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Collection) shows a shift from ~110 units/week in January to a higher plateau in February (averaging ~163 units over the last 3 weeks: 150, 177, 164). This sustained increase was previously flagged in the carry-over insights. We have experienced stockouts in Periods 1 and 2, which suggests the underlying true demand might even be slightly higher than the recorded 'sold' figures. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. For Period 4, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the most recent February demand regime. This will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the 150-177-164 period samples, ensuring we maintain a high service level to prevent further stockouts while accounting for current volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Women's Everyday' denim item showed a clear regime shift starting in February, moving from ~110 units/week to a higher level. The last four periods (P1-P4) recorded demands of 150, 177, 164, and 161 respectively. The mean of these four periods is 163.0. The standard deviation over these four periods is approximately 11.25. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 15, in-transit: 0) after several periods of high demand and slight stockouts in P1 and P2. Given the item is part of a 'Womens Everyday Collection', demand is likely to remain stable or potentially increase slightly as spring approaches. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current stable high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected 163 units plus a safety buffer for the 0-period lead time environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~163 units/week following the February shift (Periods 1-4: 150, 177, 164, 161).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Luna skinny RW' jeans transitioned from ~110 units/week in January to a higher regime in February. Over the last five periods (P1-P5), the demand has averaged 160.8 units (150, 177, 164, 161, 152), showing relative stability with a slight downward trend in the most recent period. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). With an on-hand inventory of 21 units and no in-transit units, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current stable regime. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility. L remains at the promised 0 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7 (2019/3/25), the demand for the 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Trousers) appears to have stabilized after the February jump. The demand in the last four periods (P3-P6) has been 164, 161, 152, and 148, showing a slight downward trend toward the original February mean but remaining significantly higher than the January values (~107). The average demand over the last four weeks is 156.25. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which simplifies the inventory management. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this stabilization and slight cooling of demand while maintaining enough stock to avoid the stockouts seen in P1 and P2. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=4 to reflect the current regime of ~156 units per week.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further in March: average demand over P3-P6 is 156 units/week, down ~4% from the P1-P4 peak of 163 units/week.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25) experienced a massive demand spike (366 units), more than doubling the previous regime mean of ~155. This aligns with the transition to April (Period 8, 2019/4/01), likely driven by spring fashion demand for 'Luna skinny RW' jeans and potentially Easter-related shopping. Because the last observation (366) is a significant outlier compared to the last 6 weeks (148-177), I must adjust \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) significantly to prevent further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). I will use an explicit forecast for \u03bc\u0302 set at 366 to account for this new spring peak. Since lead time has consistently been 0, I will keep L=0. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility caused by this sudden trend shift.

Carry-over insight: Sustained spring demand surge detected: Period 7 demand spiked to 366 units (+135% vs previous 4-week mean), marking a sharp departure from the March stability.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/8 (mid-Spring). Historical data shows a massive demand spike in Period 7 (366 units) followed by a elevated demand in Period 8 (235 units), compared to the March average of ~156 units. This indicates a significant spring seasonal shift for the 'Luna skinny denim jeans'. To capture this new, higher demand regime while acknowledging that the absolute peak (P7) might be an outlier compared to the more moderate but still high P8, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=2 for mu_hat specifically focuses on the last two weeks of the spring surge (average: 300.5 units). I will use N=2 for sigma_hat as well to account for the high volatility seen during this transition. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge confirmed mid-March to April: average demand increased from ~156 to ~300 (+92%) over the last two periods (P7-P8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $421.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are observing the aftermath of a significant spring demand spike that peaked in late March (Period 7: 366 units, Period 8: 235 units). The most recent demand (Period 9: 160 units) suggests a return to the pre-spike baseline of ~150-160 units (March average was ~156). The excessive order from Period 8 (456 units) has resulted in a high on-hand inventory of 219 units. In-transit is 0. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid further overstocking and increasing holding costs, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the recent three-period average (P7-P9), which captures the end of the spike while acknowledging the recent drop. This will allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock against the current high on-hand inventory and likely result in a needed pause or reduction in ordering to burn off existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge has subsided: Period 9 demand (160) returned to the March baseline (~156), following the late-March spike (P7-P8 avg 300).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing historical demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (womens denim), we observe that the major spring demand surge (Periods 7-8: demand 366 and 235) has fully subsided. Period 9 demand was 160 and Period 10 was 148, placing the current demand regime back in line with the pre-surge March average of approximately 156 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently at 194 units, which is healthy relative to recent demand. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' replenishment. To stabilize inventory levels and avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (optimal q = 0.8), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 2 periods of data (P9-P10) to capture the return to baseline, while using the standard deviation of the last 4 periods (P7-P10) for sigma_hat to account for the residual volatility from the recent surge transition.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant spike in late March/early April (Periods 7 and 8), which has since stabilized. Demand for the last three periods (P9-P11) has been 160, 148, and 152, respectively, yielding an average of approximately 153 units/week. This aligns with the 'March baseline' identified in the carry-over insights. Since the spring surge has subsided and no major upcoming holidays are immediate, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this stabilized post-spike regime. Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to reflect current volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as observed in all historical conclusions.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/06 (Period 13). Recent demand history indicates that the spring surge (Periods 7-8) has fully subsided. Demand in the last four periods (P9-P12) has been consistent: 160, 148, 152, 157, averaging 154 units per week. This is extremely close to the March baseline of 156 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is very low at 2 units. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this stable post-surge regime. Sigma_hat is also set using N=4 to reflect the current low volatility (std \u2248 5), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers expected demand while maintaining a slim buffer, especially given the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1) which naturally targets an 80% service level.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245018' (Womens Everyday Jeans) has returned to a stable demand regime after a significant spring spike in late March/early April (Periods 7-8). The recent demand over the last four periods (P10-P13) has been 148, 152, 157, and 143, respectively, averaging approximately 150 units per week. This aligns perfectly with the March baseline and indicates the seasonal surge has fully subsided. Historically, lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods. To optimize the OR backend's order calculation, I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-surge demand level and volatility while ignoring the noisy spike data. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR engine will naturally maintain a healthy safety stock to handle minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~150 units/week (P10-P13) following the conclusion of the spring seasonal volatility observed in P7-P9.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The 'Luna skinny RW' jeans demand has stabilized following the spring peak (P7-P8). Over the last five periods (P10-P14), demand has averaged 142.2 units per week, with a notable drop in the most recent period (P14: 111). This decline may indicate a move into a lower-demand summer regime or simply short-term variance. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To avoid over-reacting to the P14 dip while acknowledging the stabilization below the earlier 150-160 range, I will use a recent_N approach for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I've set N=5 to capture the post-spring stabilization period (P10-P14). This should provide a base stock sufficient to cover the current mean of ~142 units while protecting against moderate variance, balanced against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Jeans) shows a distinct downward trend over the last few weeks in May (P13: 143, P14: 111, P15: 96). This suggests a transition away from the spring demand levels (~150) towards a lower summer baseline. The Carry-over insight for P14 noted stability at ~150, but the most recent two periods (P14-P15) have dropped significantly below that level. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To align with this recent deceleration and avoid excessive holding costs (which are 25% of profit), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent mean of ~116.7 units. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=3 to reflect the current period-over-period volatility during this downward shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in May: Mean demand decreased from ~150 (P10-P13) to ~103 (P14-P15), a reduction of approx -30%.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear shift in May, where demand dropped from a stable ~150 units/period to an average of ~81 units over the last three periods (P14: 111, P15: 96, P16: 64). This represents a significant sustained reduction of approximately 45% compared to the March-April baseline. The most recent demand (64) is the lowest observed in the entire game history. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new lower-demand regime established in late May. Lead time consistently remains 0 as per 'conclude' messages (ordered and arrived in the same period), so I will use the default lead time setting. On-hand inventory is currently 73, which is sufficient to cover more than one period of the current demand level, meaning the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for June: Mean weekly demand decreased from ~150 (P10-P13) to ~90 (P14-P16), a reduction of approx -40%.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical data and recent demand trends (Periods 14-17) confirm a sustained downward shift in demand for this SKU ('Luna skinny RW'). Demand has dropped from a stable ~150 units/week in April/May to an average of ~82.5 units/week over the last 4 periods (111, 96, 64, 59). Specifically, the last two periods (64, 59) show demand potentially stabilizing even lower at around ~60 units. The spring/early summer season for basic jeans appears to be reaching a trough. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid accumulating excess holding cost with an ending on-hand of 52 units, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime (~83 units/week), which allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock down. This N=4 selection encompasses the start of the decline in Period 14 through the current levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level for June: Mean demand over P14-P17 is ~83 units/week, a significant decrease from the previous ~150 units/week baseline observed in early May.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The 'Luna skinny RW' jeans are showing a sustained decrease in demand as we move deeper into summer. Demand for the last five periods (P14-P18) has been 111, 96, 64, 59, and 55, respectively. The most recent three weeks (P16-P18) show a stable low-demand regime with an average of approximately 59 units/week. Given the trend, using the last 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat provides a slightly more conservative but responsive forecast reflecting this downturn (average ~77). Lead time is consistently 0 (observed in Period 18 conclude). On-hand inventory is 49 units, which covers about 83% of the expected demand for the upcoming period based on the most recent 3-week average. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to align stock levels with the confirmed lower demand regime of June.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 (Women's Skinny Jeans) is currently in a low-demand summer baseline. Demand has significantly decreased from the spring average (~150) to a stable low in June (~55-60). Over the last four periods (P16-P19), demand has been 64, 59, 55, and 57, respectively, averaging 58.75 units/week. This represents a sustained regime shift compared to the earlier May levels. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend aims for approximately 0.85 standard deviations above the mean. Given the stability of the current low-demand regime, I will use a restricted window (recent_N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory levels settle to match the current sales pace and minimize holding costs while the current ending inventory of 42 units already provides significant coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~59 units/week for June/early July (P16-P19), a -60% reduction from the Spring baseline (~150).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Looking at the demand history, we are in a sustained low-demand period for this SKU (Luna skinny jeans). The demand has steadily decreased from the spring baseline of ~150 to a recent low of 33 in Period 20. Over the last five periods (P16-P20), the demand values were 64, 59, 55, 57, and 33, averaging ~54 units/week. The drop in Period 20 to 33 units suggests the low-demand regime for July is potentially even lower than the June average. Given the promised lead time of 0 has consistently held true (actual lead time remains 0), the OR backend only needs to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this newest low-demand regime (mu_hat approx 54, sigma_hat reflects the recent variance including the drop to 33) to avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while demand remains suppressed during the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further decreased in late June/early July: Period 20 demand dropped to 33 units, bringing the 5-period average (P16-P20) to ~54 units/week compared to the early June average of ~83.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 is currently experiencing a sustained decline in demand as it transitions from the spring peak into the summer season. The carry-over insights and recent history show a clear downward trend: demand dropped from ~150 (May) to ~57 (mid-June) and recently hit a low of 24 in Period 21. The latest 3-period average (P19-P21) is 38 units. With on-hand inventory at 40 units and lead time consistently at 0, the current stock is sufficient to cover the immediate forecasted demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering during this seasonal lull. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 0 periods, which has been consistently observed in every 'conclude' message to date.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed for July: Mean weekly demand for late June/early July (P19-P21) is ~38 units/week, a further reduction from the early June baseline of ~59 units/week.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 is currently in a low-demand regime typical for July. Historical demand has fallen significantly from the spring baseline (~150) to a recent 3-period average (P20-P22) of ~32.7 units/week. Specifically, the last three periods recorded demands of 33, 24, and 41. Although Period 22 saw a slight uptick to 41, the overall trend since mid-June confirms a stabilized lower demand level. I am setting N=3 for mu_hat to capture this most recent stabilized regime (approx 33 units/week) while smoothing out the minor volatility seen in the last period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower volatility environment. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 22 historical conclude messages, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 (Women's Skinny Jeans) is currently in a low-demand summer phase, though Period 23 saw a sudden uptick to 63 units, causing a stockout (ending on-hand=0). This follows a period of July stability where demand averaged ~38 units (P19-P21). The Period 23 jump (63) is roughly equivalent to the June baseline (~59) rather than a complete return to Spring levels (~150). Given the stockout, I need to recalibrate the forecast to account for this higher recent demand while acknowledging the overall downward trend since Spring. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (P19-P23) captures the late June trough and the mid-July spike, yielding an average of approx 44 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Setting mu_hat to capture this recent increase protects against further stockouts if demand is recovering slightly for late summer/back-to-school transitions, while sigma_hat (recent_N=5) will adjust for the increased volatility from the P23 spike.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019/7/22 was 45 units, following a spike of 63 in the previous period. For July (P21-P24), demand has averaged approximately 43 units/week (24, 41, 63, 45), which indicates a mild recovery from the late June lows (~38 units/week). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts as seen in Period 23, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 4 weeks (N=4) to capture this moderate upward correction while maintaining efficiency. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation) seen in these July samples compared to the very stable June period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245018' (Womens skinny jeans) is currently in a stable mid-summer demand regime. After a significant drop in June/July (averaging ~38 units), demand has slightly rebounded and stabilized over the last three periods (P23-P25) at an average of 51 units (63, 45, 45). The current on-hand inventory is 12 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent stabilization. Using N=3 for mu_hat captures the recent slight increase from the July lows while ignoring the older, much lower demand points. Sigma_hat is set with N=3 to account for the current volatility in this stabilized range. Lead time remains 'default' as 0-period arrivals are consistently confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late July at ~50 units/week (P23-P25 average: 51), recovering slightly from the early July low of ~38.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for 'Luna skinny RW' jeans has entered a stable regime in late July and early August after recovering from a seasonal low in early July. The last four periods (P23-P26) show demand of 63, 45, 45, and 54, with a mean of 51.75. This indicates a stabilization around ~52 units per week, up from the July low of ~38. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since the inventory is currently low (6 units on hand), I will set mu_hat to reflect this stabilized demand of ~52. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this current late-summer regime while excluding the high-volatility spring and early summer data. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current moderate demand variance (standard deviation of ~7.8), ensuring sufficient safety stock to maintain high service levels as profit ($4.0) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in August at approximately 52 units per week (P23-P26 average: 51.75), representing a sustained recovery from the July trough of ~38.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical data and recent carry-over insights indicate that the demand for the 'Luna skinnyRW' trousers has stabilized in August. Specifically, demand over the last four periods (P24-P27) has been very consistent: 45, 45, 54, and 53, resulting in a mean of 49.25 units/week. This follows a slight recovery from the July low of ~38 units/week. Lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'conclude' messages. To capture this stabilized late-summer regime without being overly influenced by the much higher spring demand or the early July trough, I will use a recent_N approach. I select N=5 to encompass the most recent stability and the slight recovery phase (P23-P27). This N value allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock using the current mean (~52) and moderate variance, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost for the upcoming week.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized significantly since the July lows. The last six periods (P23-P28) show demand values of 63, 45, 45, 54, 53, and 37. While Period 28 saw a dip to 37, the average across the last six periods remains approximately 50 units/week, which is consistent with the 'late July/August stabilization' identified in carry-over insights. There is no evidence of a new regime shift or seasonal spike yet. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this stable ~50 unit/week regime, and sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect the modest recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the current demand pace while avoiding excess inventory costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Historical data shows that demand for 'Luna skinny RW' jeans was stable in August (P26-P29) with an average of approximately 45 units/week (54, 53, 37, 35). This is a slight decrease from the late-July average of ~52 units/week. As we enter September, we should anticipate a potential back-to-school or transitional season demand shift. However, the last two periods (P28-P29) show a notable dip (37, 35). To balance the high service level (80% target based on $4 profit vs $1 holding cost) against the recent downward trend, I will use a recent window (N=4) to capture the late August cooling while remaining sensitive to the August baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late August at ~45 units/week (P26-P29 average: 44.75), a slight cooling from the earlier August average of ~52.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for the SKU '562245018' (Womens Everyday Trousers) has stabilized at a lower level since late August. Specifically, the last five periods (P26-P30) show demand values of 54, 53, 37, 35, and 33, reflecting a cooling trend from the mid-August peak. The mean demand over the last four periods is approximately 39.5 units, down from the ~50 units seen in early August. Given this stabilization and the transition into autumn, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this more recent, slightly lower demand baseline while maintaining safety stock (sigma_hat) based on the same window to account for the variance observed during this transition (33 to 54). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with no missing shipments or delays observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in early September at ~40 units/week (P27-P30 average: 39.5), continuing the cooling trend from the mid-August average of ~52.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Collection jeans) has show a recent uptick in Period 31 (demand 61) compared to the late August/early September average of ~40. This suggests a potential transition into autumn sales. The current inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 31. Historically, the demand regime was around 40-45 units over the last 4 periods (P27-P30), but the P31 spike to 61 raises the short-term average. To capture this shift while maintaining stability, I will use a recent_N window of 5 periods (P27-P31) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which yields an average of ~43.8 units/week. Given the stockout and the likely seasonal shift towards autumn denim shopping, this conservative estimate ensures we rebuild stock without over-committing if P31 was an outlier. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in mid-September: Period 31 demand (61) increased significantly (+52%) compared to the previous 4-period average of ~40 units/week.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 562245018 (Women's skinny jeans) has entered a clear upward trend as of mid-September (Period 31: 61 units, Period 32: 101 units). This aligns with typical late-summer/early-fall 'back-to-school' or seasonal transitions for denim products. The previous regime average was ~45 units, but the last two periods averaged 81 units, with the most recent being 101. To capture this acceleration and prevent further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 110 (slightly above the last observed demand of 101 to account for continued upward momentum). Lead time remains stable at 0. Sigma_hat is set to 20 to provide a sufficient safety buffer during this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed mid-September: Weekly demand increased from ~45 to over 100 units (+120% vs Aug baseline), likely reflecting seasonal 'back-to-school' or fall fashion trends for trousers.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245018' (Luna skinny jeans) is experiencing a sharp seasonal surge in late September, likely driven by 'back-to-school' or the transition to fall/winter fashion. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 254 units, more than double the already increased Period 32 demand (101) and significantly higher than the August baseline (~45). This has resulted in stockouts for the last three consecutive periods (P31-P33). Because on-hand inventory is currently 0 and recent demand has shown an accelerating trend (61 -> 101 -> 254), an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat is necessary to avoid another stockout. I am setting mu_hat to 260 to reflect the current peak demand level. Lead time (L) consistently remains at 0 periods based on historical conclude messages. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to account for the high volatility observed during this regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Major seasonal peak confirmed for late September: Demand surged from ~100 (P32) to 254 (P33), a 150%+ increase, following the initial mid-September shift.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 (superstretch denim jeans) is currently in a high-demand fall seasonal phase. After a significant demand spike in P33 (254 units), Period 34 demand moderated to 175 units, which is still substantially higher than the August/early September baseline (~40-50 units). History shows that lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this shift, I am using a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat (covering Periods 32, 33, and 34) which averages approximately 177 units per week. This ensures the base stock reflects the current high-demand regime without being overly skewed by the single P33 outlier. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility observed during this seasonal transition. This strategy aims to maintain a high service level during the seasonal peak while preventing excessive overstocking as demand potentially stabilizes or begins to taper after the late September surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in October: Mean weekly demand for late September/early October (P32-P34) has stabilized at approximately 177 units, representing a significant sustained increase from the mid-September baseline of ~100 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 14, 2019. We are in the post-September seasonal peak for trousers. Demand spiked significantly in late September (P33: 254) and has since stabilized at a new, higher level compared to the summer. The last two periods (P34-P35) show demand of 175 and 159, respectively, moving away from the initial surge of ~254. The 'carry-over insight' from Period 35 correctly identifies a new baseline of approximately 177 units. Given the transition from a major peak to a more stable autumn level, I will use a recent window (N=3) to capture this new regime (P33-P35 demand: 254, 175, 159). This results in an average demand of 196 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 will allow the OR backend to adjust to this stabilized autumn demand while still accounting for the volatility of the recent peak in the sigma_hat calculation.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 (Women's jeans) is in a high-demand fall regime. Following the massive spike in late September (P33 demand: 254), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P34-P36) at an average of 152.6 units (175, 159, 124). This is significantly higher than the August baseline but lower than the peak surge. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this stabilized autumn regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current volatility while ignoring the massive outlier from P33. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, so I will continue using the default. With 115 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, this strategy targets a base stock level that covers the 150+ unit demand expected in Period 37, while the capped policy will prevent excessive over-ordering if demand continues to cool slightly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in mid-October at approximately 153 units/week (P34-P36 average), cooling from the late-September peak of 254 but remaining 200%+ above the summer baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $325.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans) has entered a cooling phase following the major seasonal peak in late September (P33 saw demand of 254). The mean weekly demand for October (P34-P37) has settled at approximately 139.5 units (175, 159, 124, 100), showing a steady week-over-week decline. The most recent demand was 100 units. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization while acknowledging the downward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (average ~140) ensures we have enough stock to meet demand while the ending on-hand inventory of 75 units provides a buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime cooled in late October: Mean weekly demand for P34-P37 is ~140 units, a 20% decrease from the early October average of ~177 units, indicating the passing of the fall seasonal peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering the November period. Historically for this SKU (jeans), we saw a significant demand spike in late September/early October (P32-P34) followed by a cooling trend in mid-to-late October (P35-P37). However, Period 38 saw a sudden and sharp rebound in demand to 187 units (+87% vs P37), which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Given the category (Womens Everyday Jeans) and the date (early Nov), this rebound likely signals the start of the pre-holiday shopping season or a specific promotion. I will set mu_hat using the explicit method to 185 units to account for this higher realized demand and ensure the base stock covers this renewed strength. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the significant volatility observed throughout October (ranging from 100 to 187). Lead time remains at the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected in early November: Period 38 demand surged to 187 units (+87% vs previous week), reversing the late-October cooling trend and indicating a new high-demand regime for the pre-holiday season.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, which is just before the major holiday shopping season (Singles' Day, Black Friday). In Period 38, we saw a significant demand surge to 187 units, followed by 109 units in Period 39. The 'Period 39 Rebound' mentioned in the carry-over insights was actually a localized spike, and Period 39 demand returned to a level closer to the October baseline (~150). However, given we are entering mid-November, I expect a sustained high-demand regime or further spikes due to holiday seasonality. On-hand inventory is 107. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using a recent 4-period window (P36-P39) which averages ~130 units, but I will adjust for the expected seasonal uptick. Using recent_N with N=4 captures the recent volatility while providing a baseline for the OR engine to react to seasonal growth.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the pre-holiday season. Demand for '5-pocket jeans in superstretch denim' has shown significant volatility recently: P38 spiked to 187, followed by a drop to 109 (P39) and a moderate 132 (P40). The average demand over the last three periods (P38-P40) is approximately 143 units. Historically, throughout February and March, the mean was around 150-160. Given we are approaching the Black Friday and holiday period, I expect demand to remain elevated or increase from the current baseline. On-hand inventory is 32 units with 0 in-transit. The observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-variance, pre-holiday regime (averaging ~143 units), allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current volatility and high potential for stockouts if demand spikes again.

Carry-over insight: Pre-holiday demand regime established (Nov): Mean demand for P38-P40 is ~143 units with high volatility (range 109-187), trending higher than the August/September trough.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is the start of the Black Friday / Cyber Monday week. Based on the product description ('Luna skinny RW | Womens Everyday Collection | 5-pocket jeans'), this SKU is a staple item likely to see a significant demand spike during holiday sales. Historically, we saw a massive surge in Period 7 (Spring surge) and a peak in Period 33 (late September). Recent demand from P38-P41 has averaged ~137.5 units, but with the immediate entry into the peak holiday season, I expect demand to surge again. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the pre-holiday baseline (187, 109, 132, 122) while relying on the OR backend's service level logic (profit $4 vs $1 holding cost) to buffer for the expected Black Friday spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 42 surged to 1007 units, a massively significant outlier compared to the November average of ~143. This corresponds to the Black Friday week (Nov 25, 2019), which is a major peak for apparel. Because on-hand inventory was only 167, the system experienced a massive stockout. I must treat this as a seasonal event rather than a permanent regime shift. However, as we are entering December, demand will likely stay elevated above the August/September troughs but below the Black Friday outlier. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the pre-holiday baseline while tempered by the stockout, and use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to manage the extreme volatility introduced by the 1007-unit peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme demand spike (1007 units) in Period 42 confirms Black Friday seasonal peak effect. Post-peak demand expected to settle into a holiday regime (Dec) above previous baselines.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the post-Black Friday holiday season (Dec 9). Period 42 saw a massive Black Friday spike (1007 units), and Period 43 demand remained extremely high at 771 units, likely due to Cyber Monday or extended holiday sales. Inventory is currently 0, resulting in stockouts in P42 and P43. While Black Friday demand is non-sustained, early December typically maintains a higher baseline than November before tapering toward year-end. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (P41-P43) which includes the heavy holiday volume but will be moderated by the OR backend's cap mechanism to avoid over-ordering on once-a-year peaks. L remains 'calculate' as lead time has consistently been 0. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to account for the extreme holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed (Dec): Period 43 demand reached 771 units, following the Black Friday peak (1007), indicating a high-volume holiday shopping regime significantly above the November baseline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand in Period 43 (771) and Period 42 (1007) confirmed a massive holiday/Black Friday surge. However, Period 44 demand dropped sharply to 88 units. This suggests the primary holiday peak has passed for this SKU (Everyday Collection 5-pocket jeans), as shoppers likely completed their main purchases during the late Nov/early Dec promotions. Looking at the on-hand inventory of 932 units, we are significantly overstocked relative to the most recent demand (88) and the pre-peak baseline (~140-150). With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the OR engine's critical fractile is 0.8, but our current inventory levels already far exceed any reasonable base stock for a single period (L=0). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the extreme volatility of the last three weeks (88, 771, 1007), which will result in a high base_stock. However, since on-hand (932) is already very high, the capped policy will naturally result in a zero or near-zero order, allowing the system to bleed off excess inventory and minimize further holding costs while still maintaining a safety buffer in case of a secondary Christmas week spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak passed: Demand dropped from 771 (P43) to 88 (P44), leaving high on-hand inventory (932).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late December (Period 46, Dec 23). The massive demand spike from Black Friday (P42: 1007 units) and the subsequent holiday rush (P43: 771 units) has clearly passed. Demand in the last two periods has plummeted (P44: 88 units, P45: 77 units), as is typical for post-holiday cooling and stock clearance phases. Currently, we have 947 units on hand, which is enough to cover over 10 weeks of demand at the current rate (~80-90 units/week). My objective is to avoid further accumulation of holding costs while this excess inventory is drawn down. I will set the lead time to the promised 0 periods (default). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'm using the last 2 periods (recent_N=2) to reflect the immediate post-holiday demand level. With on-hand inventory (947) far exceeding the calculated base stock for a 0-period lead time, the OR backend will correctly place an order of 0 units.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday cooling confirmed: Demand decreased from holiday peaks (770+) to a baseline of ~83 units/week (P44-P45 avg) in late December.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-687.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 47 (Dec 30). The massive holiday peaks (P42: 1007, P43: 771) are over. Since P44, demand has returned to a much lower baseline (P44: 88, P45: 77, P46: 52). We have a very large on-hand inventory of 895 units, which was ordered during the peak and arrived just as demand cooled. This inventory is far beyond any foreseeable weekly demand for January, which historically (see provided historical samples) sits around 100-120 units. To minimize holding costs while the backend processes its safety stock calculations, I will use methods that reflect this sharp drop in volume. mu_hat will use the last 3 periods to capture the post-holiday cooling (average ~72), and sigma_hat will also use recent data to avoid inflating volatility with the Black Friday spike. With 895 units on hand, the backend should effectively stop ordering until this surplus is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand return to Jan baseline: Demand has dropped and stabilized at ~72 units/week (P44-P46) following the Dec surge.
