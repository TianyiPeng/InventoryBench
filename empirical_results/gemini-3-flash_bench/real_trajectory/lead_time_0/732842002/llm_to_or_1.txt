Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for this SKU (Ladies Denim) shows a significant upward trend: 0, 0, 14, 52, 121. This suggests a post-holiday ramp-up or a new product launch phase. The current inventory is zero. Given the rapid increase in demand over the last three weeks, using the mean of all samples would severely underestimate requirements. I will use the most recent 3 periods to capture the growth trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time is 0, and since we have no delivery history yet, I will use the default lead time setting.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 63 units based on a lead time of 0. These units arrived and were immediately sold out, as the demand was 131 units, significantly higher than the previous historical average (which peaked at 121 in the last observation). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. The product is a staple denim item ('Embrace S.Skinny') which is showing a strong upward demand trend over the last three weeks (14, 52, 121, 131). Given the stockout in Period 1 and the consistent growth, I will set mu_hat to capture this recent high-demand regime. Using recent_N with N=3 for demand parameters to focus on the 121-131 range, while maintaining the promised lead time of 0 as confirmed by the Period 1 arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Ladies Denim' item, specifically 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash', which is a fashion staple. Current demand is showing a strong upward trend: 0, 0, 14, 52, 121 (pre-game) followed by 131 and 157 in Periods 1 and 2. We are consistently stocking out (sold = on-hand, ending inventory = 0), indicating that the current ordering logic (capped by the OR backend) is underestimating the true demand. The observed lead time is 0 periods, which is consistent with the promised lead time. To address the stockouts and the clear growth trend, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the most recent acceleration (avg ~136) and set an 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for higher volatility during this growth phase. I will maintain the 'default' lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Rapid growth from 52 to 157 over last 3 periods. Consistent stockouts in P1 and P2 indicate demand exceeds order caps.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842002' (Ladies Denim) is in a high-demand phase following its introduction. Demand samples over the last four periods are 121, 131, 157, and 108. The dip to 108 in Period 3 follows two periods of total stockouts where the OR engine's 'cap' limited the order size below actual demand. Given the product is 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans, we are currently in the early spring season (early March), which is a peak period for new denim styles. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time is 0 (orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 arrived in the same period). To ensure we satisfy the sustained high demand and account for the stockouts in P1/P2 that likely masked true demand levels, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to focus on the high-growth phase while tempering slightly for the latest P3 observation. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to capture high recent volatility. L remains default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a recurring fashion denim item ('Embrace S.Skinny'). Analysis of Period 1-4 shows that demand peaked early in the game (131 and 157 units) during February, likely due to a product launch or seasonal promotion, and has since decelerated significantly (108 and 73 units). The Period 4 demand of 73 is the lowest observed since the peak. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (4/4 arrivals in the same period). Given profit=$1 and holding=$1, the target service level is 50%, meaning we should target the median demand. Using N=3 for demand parameters captures the recent downward trend (avg ~96) while moving away from the extreme early stockout periods. Since demand is cooling off, a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 will help avoid overstocking while maintaining enough inventory for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-launch peak (P1-P2 avg 144) has transitioned to a cooling phase (P3-P4 avg 90), indicating a -37% demand reduction.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a fashion denim item (Super Skinny High Waist). History shows a clear launch peak in mid-February (P1 demand=131, P2 demand=157) followed by a stabilization/cooling phase in late February and early March (P3=108, P4=73, P5=72). The current demand has stabilized around a mean of 72.5 units over the last two periods. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To avoid overstocking while holding costs and profit are equal ($1/unit), I am setting the forecast based on the most recent 3 periods (P3-P5) to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 84 units/period), as opposed to the higher full-history average. Method 'recent_N' with N=3 will be used for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized volatility and volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Post-peak demand has leveled off at ~72-73 units per period for the last two weeks (P4-P5), down from the P1-P2 average of 144.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Lead time is consistently 0. The product is 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' (Ladies Denim), which saw a demand peak in Feb (P1-P2, avg 144) and a cooling phase in March (P3-P5, avg ~84). However, in Period 6, demand unexpectedly jumped back up to 93, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0, sold 85/demand 93). This suggests that while demand isn't at peak levels, it is more volatile than the 'stabilized' forecast of ~72 per period. I am setting L=0 (explicitly confirmed as 0 every period). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 (N=4 covers P3-P6 where mean is 86.5) to capture the current post-peak regime while weighting the recent uptick. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to account for the increased volatility seen in Period 6, ensuring the OR backend sets a higher base stock to prevent another stockout given the 50/50 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (March 25) saw a massive demand surge to 317 units, a +240% increase from Period 6. This aligns with a Spring seasonal peak for denim products. Because Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the service level target is 50%, meaning the base stock equals the expected demand (mu_hat). However, the OR backend caps orders based on mu + 1.645*sigma. To recover from back-to-back stockouts (Period 6 and 7) and accommodate this new demand regime, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the most recent high-demand observation (317) and providing a high sigma_hat (100) to ensure the backend cap does not restrict the order. Actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Significant Spring seasonal demand spike confirmed at Period 7: Demand increased from ~80 to 317 (+296%). Previous 'cooling' regime is over.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 8, 2019. We are in the middle of a confirmed Spring seasonal demand spike for these skinny jeans. Period 7 saw a massive spike to 317 units, and Period 8 followed with 199 units (avg ~258 over the last two weeks). My previous order based on Period 7's data was 317 units, which was received in full (lead time 0 is consistent). The current on-hand inventory is 118 units. Given the seasonality of high-waist denim in Spring (March/April), I expect demand to remain elevated but potentially stabilize or slightly taper from the initial peak. I will use the average of the last 2 periods (the spike regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=2 for the regime length since the shift happened exactly two periods ago. This ensures we don't under-order and return to the stockout state seen in Period 7, while acknowledging that the 317 peak might have included some latent demand from the Period 6 stockout.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal peak (late March/early April) demand average is approximately 258 units per period, following a 63-93 unit baseline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The 'Spring seasonal peak' identified in periods 7 and 8 (demand of 317 and 199) is now showing signs of deceleration, with Period 9 demand dropping to 118. The product is a seasonal denim item. Historically, after the initial late February peak (131, 157), demand cooled to a baseline of ~72-93. We are currently observing a similar cooling post-Easter/Spring peak (317 -> 199 -> 118). To avoid excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will use a recent_N approach to capture this downward trend rather than basing the forecast on the high seasonal peak. N=3 captures the transition (317, 199, 118), which averages to 211, providing a safe but descending lead-time demand forecast. The lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Spring seasonal peak cooling: Demand has decreased from 317 (P7) to 118 (P9). Forecast should now pivot to avoid overstocking as the seasonal surge dissipates.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of ladies' denim trousers. We are currently in Period 11 (2019/4/22), moving past the late March/early April 'Spring seasonal' demand peak. Demand has consistently decelerated from its peak of 317 in Period 7: P8=199, P9=118, P10=82. This confirms the 'post-Spring cooling' insight from the previous period. The current demand (82) aligns closely with the pre-peak baseline (approx. 70-90 units). Inventory is currently 130 units, which covers more than the immediate expected demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while holding costs equal profit ($1.0), I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the cooling phase (199, 118, 82) to set a base stock that respects the downward trend while maintaining a safety buffer in case demand stabilizes at this level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at baseline levels: Following the late March peak, demand has returned to a range of 80-120 units (P9=118, P10=82), similar to the P4-P6 baseline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 29, 2019. Historical data confirms that the drastic demand spike observed in late March (Period 7: 317 units) has subsided. For the last three periods (P9-P11), demand has stabilized at 118, 82, and 117 units respectively, which aligns with the carry-over insight suggesting a baseline regime of 80-120 units. The spring seasonal peak is over. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the spring peak is concluded and we are entering May, I will use a 3-period lookback (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'post-peak' behavior. On-hand inventory is low (16), and the profit vs. holding cost ratio (1:1) requires a balanced service level. Setting L to default (0) as all orders have arrived same-period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in a post-seasonal stabilization phase. In Period 12, a demand of 107 resulted in a stockout (sold 106, starting 106), leaving 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Over the last four periods (P9-P12), demand has been consistently between 82 and 118, with an average of approximately 106 units. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' that demand has settled back to its baseline after the late March/early April spike (Spring seasonal peak). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit while minimizing holding costs (which are equal at $1.0), I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized baseline volatility and mean. This ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the profit/holding cost ratio while using the most relevant recent demand distribution.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. This product (Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash Jeans) experienced a significant seasonal peak in late March/early April (P7-P8) and has since stabilized into a consistent post-peak demand regime. For the last five periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged approximately 99 units (118, 82, 117, 107, 71). The most recent demand was 71, suggesting a potential further softening as we move away from Spring peak buying periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the current on-hand inventory of 35 units and balance the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), I will target a base stock level that reflects this 'new normal' baseline. I'm choosing N=5 for the demand parameters to capture the post-peak stability while filtering out the volatile seasonal surge.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is 'Super Skinny High Waist' jeans, which saw a major seasonal spike in late March/early April (Spring season peaks). Since Period 11, the demand has stabilized back into a baseline regime. Looking at the last four periods (P11-P14), demand values were 117, 107, 71, and 96, averaging approx 98 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently very low (3 units). Every order in history has successfully arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, including the last few periods. I will set L to 0 using the 'calculate' method to reflect this consistent track record. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current stable post-peak demand level (~98 units), which prevents overstocking from the earlier seasonal spike while ensuring enough inventory to meet the present baseline demand. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level is 50%, making accurate mean estimation critical.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear stabilization period following the late-March spring surge. Over the last five periods (P11-P15), demand has been consistently stable within a range of 71 to 117, with a five-period average of 96.6 units. The product is a staple item (high-waisted super-skinny jeans), and there is no evidence of an upcoming seasonal spike for the end of May. Given that the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To maintain safety stock while reflecting the current stable demand regime, I will use a recent_N method where N=5 to capture the stabilized average and volatility since the post-peak cooling phase ended.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization confirmed (P11-P15): Demand has fluctuated between 71 and 117 units, maintaining an average of approximately 97 units per period following the Spring peak.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 3rd (Period 17). The product is a staple denim item (Super Skinny High Waist). History shows the lead time is consistently 0 periods. Demand has stabilized into a steady regime following the late-March/early-April peak. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged 99 units (values: 117, 107, 71, 96, 92, 117). This indicates a very stable baseline. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this post-peak average. Given the nearly 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the backend base-stock calculation will target a 50% service level plus a modest safety stock buffer. I will use the default sigma_hat to allow the backend to use the full historical standard deviation, ensuring adequate coverage for the observed volatility within this stable regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Demand for this SKU (super-skinny denim trousers) has stabilized following the Spring peak. Analyzing the demand from Period 11 to Period 17 (the most recent stable regime), the average demand is approximately 94 units (117, 107, 71, 96, 92, 117, 75). In the most recent period (P17), demand was 75 units, but this follows a slightly higher period (P16: 117). Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, which aligns the base stock closely with the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the characteristics of this stable post-peak period (P11-P17). This will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current baseline of ~94 units, ensuring we don't overstock while maintaining enough inventory for minor weekly fluctuations.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product (super-skinny high-waist jeans) has exited the Spring seasonal peak (Periods 7-9) and settled into a stable early-summer demand regime. For the last 8 periods (P11-P18), demand has averaged approximately 90 units (range 63-117), with the most recent two periods (P17-P18) showing a slight deceleration to 75 and 63 units, potentially indicating a move toward a lower summer baseline. Lead time is consistently 0. Given Profit=1 and Holding Cost=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock target should be the median demand. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the stable post-peak regime while acknowledging the slight downward trend. The 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat will calculate the appropriate base stock for a 1-period coverage (L=0 + 1 review period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Demand has softened from a post-Spring average of ~97 to an early Summer average of ~69 (P17-P18), indicating a potential minor downward shift in seasonal baseline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' skinny jeans, which typically experiences steady baseline demand with occasional seasonal peaks. Following the Spring seasonal peak (Mar/Apr), demand stabilized around 97 units before recently softening to an early summer average (P17-P19) of 64.7 units. The most recent demand was 56 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the transition into a lower demand regime and the high holding cost (equal to profit), it is prudent to tighten inventory. mu_hat will be set using a recent_N of 3 to reflect this early summer softening (avg ~65), and sigma_hat will also use a recent_N of 3 to narrow the safety stock around this new mean, minimizing the risk of expensive overstocking while demand is trending downwards.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Based on the historical demand data, the product (ladies denim skinny jeans) has entered a deeper cooling phase following the Spring peak and a minor downward shift observed in early June. Specifically, demand in the last four periods (P17-P20) has dropped to 75, 63, 56, and most recently 24 units, indicating a significant deceleration as the summer season progresses. The average demand over these four periods (N=4) is 54.5 units, but the last two periods (avg=40) suggest even lower velocity. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the sharp drop to 24 units in P20, I will use a conservative mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to account for this cooling regime while maintaining enough stock to cover lead time (L=0). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The OR backend uses a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1)) which is appropriate for a product with equal profit and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 20: Demand has significantly decelerated from an early summer average of ~69 (P17-P19) to a lower baseline, with P20 recording 24 units (-65% vs previous average).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 732842002 (Ladies Denim) is currently in a summer cooling phase. Demand has significantly decelerated from a Spring/early-Summer average of ~97 to a much lower baseline. In the last two periods (P20-P21), demand was 24 and 41, averaging 32.5 units per period. This confirms the 'Period 21' insight regarding a sharp deceleration. On-hand inventory is 14. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for this lower-demand regime, I will focus on the most recent 3 periods (P19-P21) which reflect this shift. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current lower mean (~40 units) and variance, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current decelerated demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed (P20-P21): The Summer regime has stabilized at a significantly lower baseline, averaging ~33 units per period compared to the previous ~69, a reduction of ~50%.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in a stabilized Summer low-demand regime for these skinny jeans. Over the last three periods (P20-P22), demand has been 24, 41, and 45 units, averaging 36.7 units per period. This confirms the previously identified deceleration. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Based on the profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, meaning we should set our parameters to cover the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand volatility and mean accurately without being influenced by higher Spring or early June averages. This approach prevents overstocking as we navigate the mid-summer seasonal trough.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable Summer demand regime. Since Period 21, demand has been consistently low, with observations of 41, 45, and 40 units (average of 42 over the last 3 periods). This follows the significant drop from the early Summer average of ~69. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is no inventory in transit. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a sufficient service level while minimizing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current stable low-demand baseline (P20-P23: 24, 41, 45, 40). This prevents over-ordering based on older, higher-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization confirmed (P21-P23): Demand has stabilized at a Summer baseline average of ~42 units per period (41, 45, 40), slightly higher than the sharp drop seen in P20 (24).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans has stabilized at a low Summer baseline. The last few periods (P21-P24) show demand values of 41, 45, 40, and 17. The sharp drop to 17 in P24 suggests a further softening or potentially a late July/early August transition. Given the high stockout frequency in earlier periods, the policy is sensitive to demand variance. Lead time 'L' remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'arrived=ordered' same-period pattern observed throughout the history. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current Summer regime (including the recent 17 drop), which averages ~36 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for sigma_hat to provide a more robust variance estimate that accounts for recent fluctuations while preventing over-ordering as we move deeper into the low-demand Summer season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening further in late July: Period 24 demand dropped to 17, compared to the previous Summer average of ~42.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans (Ladies Denim) shows a volatile late Summer pattern. After a significant softening in July (P24 demand=17), Period 25 saw a sharp, unexpected spike to 65 units, which exhausted all available stock (on-hand 0). This suggests that while there is a general downward trend from the Spring/Early Summer peaks, there is still significant residual demand or potential 'back-to-school' early interest picking up in August. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts seen in P25 while acknowledging the overall lower Summer average compared to Spring, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5. This captures the most recent regime shift (the July/August transition) which averages ~41 units per period, while accounting for the high volatility (17 to 65 jump) to ensure the OR engine sets a sufficiently high base stock to cover these bursts.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late July/early August: Period 25 demand (65) significantly exceeded the previous 3-period average (~32), ending the sharp 'softening' trend observed in P24.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 732842002 (Ladies Denim) shows a transition from a low mid-summer baseline (~42 units) to a late summer volatility increase, with demand hitting 65 and 72 units in the last two periods (P25-P26). This likely signals the start of a late-summer/pre-autumn uptick as shoppers look for denim. Since profitability and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the OR engine naturally targets a 50% service level, but given the recent upward trend and zero on-hand inventory, I must ensure the forecast (mu_hat) reflects this higher recent average to prevent stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current upward movement (average of 17, 65, 72 is ~51) rather than the long-term low baseline. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Late-summer uptick identified. Demand increased from a Summer average of ~42 to a 2-period average of ~68.5 (P25-P26), representing a ~63% increase.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 732842002 (Ladies Denim) is currently in a confirmed late-summer uptrend. Demand has increased from a Summer baseline (P21-P24 avg ~35) to 65 (P25), 72 (P26), and now 101 (P27). This suggests a shift toward a higher demand regime, likely related to back-to-school or late-summer fashion inventory needs. The current 3-period average (P25-P27) is ~79.3 units, but the most recent observation of 101 suggests momentum is continuing upward. Given lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set the base stock to cover this increasing demand while accounting for high volatility (std dev of recent periods). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime shift (P25 onwards) and avoid under-ordering during this uptick.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 confirmed: Late-summer uptrend continued with demand hitting 101, up from previous 2nd-period uptick of 72. Average demand for the last 3 periods (P25-P27) is ~79 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W' jeans is experiencing a late-summer/back-to-school uptick. Period 28 demand was 77, following values of 65, 72, and 101 in the preceding periods. This confirms a shift from the mid-summer low (~42) to a higher late-August regime. Averaging the last 4 periods (P25-P28) gives a mean of 78.75 units. I will set mu_hat to 80 (explicitly) to align with this recent average and prevent stockouts seen in Periods 25-27. Since demand volatility is high during regime transitions, I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 25 (covering roughly 1 standard deviation of recent fluctuations) to ensure adequate safety stock without excessive holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently very low (3 units). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed late August: Demand has stabilized at a higher late-summer average of ~79 units/period (P25-P28), up from the mid-summer average of ~42.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash jeans (732842002) has stabilized into a late-summer/early-autumn regime. After a sharp uptick in August (P25-P27), demand settled at 77 in P28 and 66 in P29. The current average for this regime (P25-P29) is approximately 76 units per period. The lead time is confirmed and consistent at 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (the median). Given the recent stabilization, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current late-summer baseline while remaining responsive to potential autumn shifts as we enter September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 732842002 remains in the 'late-summer' regime. Over the most recent 6 periods (P25-P30), demand has averaged 78.1 units (65, 72, 101, 77, 66, 88). This is a significant increase from the mid-summer average of ~42. In P30, demand was 88 units, resulting in a stockout. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized higher demand and ensure sufficient stock to meet the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile 0.5), I am using L=0, \u03bc\u0302 based on the last 6 periods of the current regime (N=6), and \u03c3\u0302 based on those same periods to account for the observed volatility in this uptick phase.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 732842002 (Skinny Jeans) is currently in a stabilized demand regime following a late-August uptick. Since Period 25, demand has averaged approximately 76 units per period (P25-P31 actuals: 65, 72, 101, 77, 66, 88, 65). We are currently in mid-September (2019/9/16). Based on the 7-period average of this 'Back-to-School/Early Autumn' phase, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this specific level. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and responsive replenishment. The goal is to maintain a high service level for this staple denim item while accounting for the recent range of 65-101 units.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/Early-autumn demand regime (P25 onwards) has stabilized at an average of ~76 units per period, consistently higher than the mid-summer low of ~42.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Historical demand shows a stabilization in the late-summer/early-autumn period (P25-P32) with an average demand of approximately 76 units. However, the most recent period (P32) recorded a demand of 47 units, and P31 was 65 units, suggesting a potential seasonal softening as we move deeper into autumn. The transition from late August/early September (demand ~80) to mid-late September (demand ~50-60) indicates a downward trend. Lead time has consistently resided at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a safe service level for this 'Embrace' skinny jean SKU, I will adjust mu_hat using a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the cooling demand trend (Average of P28-P32 is 68.6). Sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 5 periods to reflect the current volatility (std dev ~14.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening in mid-September: Demand has decreased from a late-summer average of ~79 (P25-P28) to an average of ~56 over the last two weeks (P31-P32).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September/early October. History shows demand has recently fluctuated: P31 (65), P32 (47), P33 (96). While P33 saw a significant spike, the overall trend over the last 4 periods (P30-P33) averages ~74 units, which is consistent with the late-summer/early-autumn regime (~76 units) previously observed. The 'softening' noted in P33's carry-over (based on P31-P32) was likely premature given the P33 spike to 96. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this volatile but stabilized autumn window. Lead time remains stable at 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the P33 stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized at the late-summer/early-autumn average of ~75 units despite high weekly volatility (P32: 47 vs P33: 96).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' denim jeans, which generally sees stable demand in autumn. Recent demand history shows significant volatility but identifies a stable late-summer/early-autumn regime. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is 70.9 units. Looking at the most recent 4 periods (P31-P34), demand has been 65, 47, 96, and 62, averaging 67.5 units. The Carry-over insights suggest a stabilization around 75 units, but the actual realized demand over the last month averages slightly lower. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent window of N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the transition into and stabilization of the autumn regime while smoothing out the high weekly variance (47 vs 96). With on-hand at 12 and lead time 0, the explicit goal is to cover the upcoming period's demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in early autumn (Sept-Oct): Average demand over P25-P34 is ~71 units, showing higher volatility (SD ~17) compared to mid-summer but remaining below the Spring peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October. Demand for these high-waist skinny jeans has stabilized in a broad early-autumn range. Over the last 11 periods (P25-P35), the average demand is 70.8 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. The recent two-period demand (P34: 62, P35: 40) shows a slight cooling, but high volatility in this SKU (e.g., P32: 47 to P33: 96) suggests we should maintain a robust stock level rather than cutting too deep. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance the relatively high holding cost (equal to profit), I will use a recent_N approach (N=11) to capture the current autumn regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the distant mid-summer lows and spring peaks. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for recent variance without over-reacting to the single low data point in P35.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans is currently in an early autumn softening phase. Period 36 demand was 49, and Period 35 was 40, following an autumn average of ~71 (P25-P34). Over the last 5 periods (P32-P36), demand has averaged approximately 59 units, showing a clear descent from the late-summer peaks. The current inventory is 22 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the moderate volatility observed in the autumn season. This will adjust the base stock to reflect the current mean demand of ~59 units, preventing excess holding costs as the product moves further away from its seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Significant softening observed in mid-October. The 2-period average (P35-P36) is ~44.5 units, a 37% decrease from the P25-P34 average of ~71 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. This SKU (Super Skinny Jeans) has entered a softened mid-autumn regime. Period 37 demand (64) was higher than the previous two weeks (avg 44.5), but still represents a decline compared to the late-summer/early-autumn baseline (~75). The inventory position is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 37 where demand (64) exceeded total supply (59). To prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the lower seasonal baseline compared to summer, I will use a recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current softened regime (avg ~51)\u800c not the long-term history. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a post-October softening phase for these skinny jeans. Demand in the last four periods (P35-P38) has been 40, 49, 64, and 48, averaging ~50 units per period. This is a noticeable step down from the autumn average of ~71. The spike to 64 in P37 was solitary and followed by a return to the ~50 level. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels during this lower-demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture this current ~50 units/period baseline for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the recently observed localized volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime softening confirmed (P35-P38): Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn average of ~50 units per period (40, 49, 64, 48), down from the previous average of ~71.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a late-autumn cooling phase. Period 39 recorded a demand of 18, which is significantly lower than the previous 4-period average of ~50. This suggest a further softening of demand as we move deeper into November. The product (super-skinny denim) often sees lower demand in late autumn before any potential holiday lift. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the average reflecting the high 40s/low 50s, but include the recent drop to 18 to avoid excessive overstocking. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide sufficient safety stock for the observed volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening further in early November: Period 39 demand dropped to 18, compared to the late-autumn average of ~50 (P35-P38).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Ladies Denim SKU '732842002' has entered a significant softening phase in early November. Period 39 recorded 18 units and Period 40 recorded 27 units. This follows a late-autumn average of ~50 units (P35-P38). The current 2-period average (P39-P40) is 22.5 units, which is a ~55% reduction from the previous regime. This likely reflects a seasonal transition as we move deeper into November. With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 50%, making inventory efficiency critical to avoid holding costs on a declining product. On-hand inventory is 17 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 3 to adapt quickly to this lower demand floor while maintaining a small buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 41: Demand has transitioned from a late-autumn average of ~50 units to a late-November baseline averaging ~22.5 units (P39-P40), a ~55% decrease.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a late-autumn softening phase for this SKU (ladies' skinny jeans). Demand peaked in Spring (P7-P11) and had a secondary moderate peak in late summer (P27-P31). Recent demand has trended significantly lower: the last 3 periods (P39-P41) show demand of 18, 27, and 33 units, averaging ~26 units. This is a clear shift from the previous average of ~50. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently 0 with nothing in transit. To prevent overstocking during this low-demand baseline while maintaining service levels, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent regime of ~26 units, and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility (18 to 33 range).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Late-autumn baseline has stabilized at ~26 units per period (P39-P41), down approximately 48% from the previous mid-autumn average of ~50.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Recent demand history indicates a significant shift: Period 42 saw a demand of 62, a sharp spike compared to the late-autumn average of ~26 units (P39-P41). This coincides with late November/early December (Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales period), suggesting a recurring seasonal surge. I will adjust the mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this upward movement while balancing the lower baseline of the previous 3 periods. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Demand spiked to 62 units from a late-autumn baseline of ~26 units, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday seasonal events.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Demand spiked to 62 in Period 42 (Nov 25) and has now retreated to 23 in Period 43. This pattern suggests the holiday promotional peak for this SKU has passed, returning to a late-autumn baseline. Analyzing the recent periods (P39-P43), demand has been 18, 27, 33, 62, and 23. Excluding the P42 spike as a transient event, the baseline average is approximately 25 units. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current post-spike stabilization while still accounting for the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the increased variance caused by the seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-Black Friday (P43) has returned to the late-autumn baseline, with demand dropping from a peak of 62 (P42) to 23 (P43).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the post-Cyber Monday/Black Friday period heading towards the Christmas and end-of-year sales. Historical demand shows that after the Black Friday spike (P42 demand: 62), demand returned to a baseline range of 23-31 units. The carry-over insights correctly identified a late-autumn softening to ~26 units before the holiday spike. As we are now in the mid-December period, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly increase towards the end of the year, but the immediate trend is a return toward the baseline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent behavior (P40-P44) while inclusive of the spike to maintain a safe service level. This N captures the shift from the low-20s back to the 30s as observed in P44. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-holiday spike (P42: 62) has stabilized in the 23-31 range (P43-P44), confirming a return to the late-autumn baseline with slight holiday-driven upside.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-Christmas week. Historical data shows that following the Black Friday spike (P42: 62 units), demand returned to a baseline range of 23-36 units (P43-P45). The average demand over the last three periods (P43-P45) is 30 units, which is significantly lower than the autumn average (~50) or the late-summer peak (~79), but represents a stable late-December baseline. Given the product is 'super-skinny ankle-length jeans', demand is likely to remain relatively flat or slightly soften during the deep winter months of January until the Spring refresh. I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this post-holiday stabilization (P41-P45 average is 37 units) while maintaining enough responsiveness for the transition into January. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stabilized in a late-December baseline of 23-36 units (avg ~30) following the Black Friday spike, confirming the cessation of the high-auto-volatility autumn regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, following the Christmas/Boxing Day week (P46 demand: 38). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. Demand has stabilized into a late-December baseline following the Black Friday spike (P42). For the period P43-P46, demand has been 23, 31, 36, and 38, respectively (average ~32). This indicates a slight gradual increase possibly due to holiday sales or New Year's Eve preparations, but generally stays consistent with the 'late-autumn/winter' baseline identified in the carry-over insights. I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the post-Black Friday stabilization. Setting L to 'default' (promised 0) is appropriate as actual lead time has perfectly matched promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late December (P43-P46) at an average of ~32 units per period, following the Black Friday spike.
