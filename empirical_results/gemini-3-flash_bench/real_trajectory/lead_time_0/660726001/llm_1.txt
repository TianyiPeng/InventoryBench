  "rationale": "a) World Knowledge & Product Description: The product is a 'Straight-cut blouse in a slightly stretchy weave with a V-neck and short cap sleeves'. This is a spring/summer garment. The date is early February, which aligns with the transition toward spring fashion in many markets. b) Demand Regime Analysis: Historical data shows demand starting from 0 in early January and ramping up to ~26 units per week in late January/early February (2019-01-21: 13, 2019-01-28: 27, 2019-02-04: 26). This suggests a stabilizing demand regime around 25-30 units as we move into the spring season. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and satisfy demand in this same period. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0, and In-transit is 0. e) Final Order Logic: Since the product arrives in the same period (L=0) and the current period's demand happens after the arrival, I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Given the recent history (26 and 27 units), I will forecast demand at approximately 30 units and add a small buffer for the upward seasonal trend, ordering 35 units to ensure no stockouts while keeping holding costs low ($1/unit).",

However, in Period 1 (Feb 11) and Period 2 (Feb 18), we saw a significant explosion in demand to 60 and 146 units, respectively. This suggests a seasonal transition into Spring 'Womens Tailoring' or a successful promotion. Despite ordering 35 and 70 units, we stocked out both times (sold 35/35 and 70/70), meaning actual demand (60 and 146) far exceeded our inventory. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 3 (Feb 25), I expect demand to continue its upward trajectory or stabilize at a high level. Given the jump from 60 to 146, ordering for a demand of roughly 180-200 units is prudent to capture profit ($19/unit) while the holding cost ($1/unit) is relatively low.

I will target an inventory level of 150 units to cover the expected demand (avg ~103 + safety stock for potential growth in March).

We should expect a similar trend as temperatures drop in September. Inventory is currently 0. I will forecast demand for Period 32 at approximately 80 units (accounting for the recent bounce but respecting the overall downward seasonal trend).
