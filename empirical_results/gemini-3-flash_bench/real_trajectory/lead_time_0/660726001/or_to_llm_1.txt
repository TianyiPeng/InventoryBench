The OR recommendation suggests ordering 36 units based on a promised lead time of 0. Current on-hand inventory is 0. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the critical fractile is very high (0.95), favoring maintaining higher stock levels to avoid stockouts. Although 2019-02-11 is post-Valentine's Day, demand for short-sleeved blouses typically increases in the approach to spring.

We sold out (36 units) and had 0 ending inventory, meaning there was a stockout of 24 units. This indicates a significant upward trend compared to the initial historical samples (which averaged ~13 units). The product is a women's blouse, and mid-February often marks the start of the spring fashion transition, explaining the demand spike (27 to 26 to 60). 3. **OR Recommendation Analysis**: The OR agent recommends 58 units based on historical samples (0, 0, 13, 27, 26, 60). The empirical mean is roughly 21, but the recent demand of 60 is much higher. The OR cap is likely limiting the order because it doesn't weigh the most recent '60' demand heavily enough. 4. **Strategy**: With L=0, we only need to cover the current period's demand.

The historical demand samples provided (0, 0, 13, 27, 26) are outdated and no longer reflect the current regime. Recent demand is averaging around 100+ units. OR Recommendation: 124 units.

Given the significant upward trend (60 to 146 units), I need to order enough to cover the expected demand for the current period, plus a buffer, since stockouts occurred two weeks in a row.

The product is a short-sleeved blouse, and the current date is early March, indicating a seasonal shift towards spring/summer styles. The OR recommendation of 86 is based on all historical data (including zeros/lows in Jan), which underrepresents the current regime.\n3. Inventory Status: Current on-hand is 48. There is no pipeline inventory. Expected demand for Period 4 is likely to remain in the 100-140 range.\n4.

Inventory Position: On-hand is 46. In-transit is 0. Since L=0, we need to cover only Period 5's demand. \n4. OR Recommendation: OR suggests 94 units. Looking at the stats, average demand is ~103. If I order 94, total stock for Period 5 will be 140 (46 + 94). If demand spikes back toward 146 (like Period 2), 140 is a safe but lean level. Since the safety factor for a high-margin product ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) should be high (critical fractile ~0.95), I will aim for a stock level of approximately 150 units to prevent lost sales.\n5.

To maintain service levels for a demand regime averaging ~100 units/period, I need to bring total inventory for the current period up to approximately 150 (covering the ~100 mean + safety stock). 4.

Demand Analysis: The product is a short-cap sleeve blouse. Since the current date is April 15, we are entering the spring/summer peak season for this item. Historical demand since the regime shift in Period 1 (late Feb) has averaged approximately 103 units per period (sum of P1-P9 demand / 9 periods = 928 / 9 \u2248 103.1). The most recent period saw a dip to 79, but demand in P7 and P8 was 105 and 114 respectively. 3. Inventory Position: We have 69 units on-hand. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 77 units, which targets a base stock of roughly 146 units (69 + 77). Given the actual mean demand of ~103 and a lead time of 0, a stock level of 146 provides a safety buffer of about 40% over the mean, which is appropriate given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) and the seasonal relevance of the item (spring blouse).
