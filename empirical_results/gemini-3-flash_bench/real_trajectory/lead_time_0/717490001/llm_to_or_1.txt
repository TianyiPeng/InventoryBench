Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for a Jersey T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks shows a declining trend: 100, 66, 70, 62, 53. The average demand is 70.2 with a standard deviation of 17.7. Given the 'Divided Basics' category, this is a staples item, and the decline might be a post-holiday normalization or a seasonal shift. Since this is the first period, promised lead time is 0. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand levels while ignoring any very old data once it arrives. For Period 1, with On-hand=0 and In-transit=0, and a promised lead time of 0, the OR engine needs to order enough for at least the current period's demand. I'll set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the 5 available samples to establish a baseline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Examining the history: Period 1 had a demand of 41 units. The actual lead time for the Period 1 order was 0 periods (arrived immediately), which matches the promised lead time. The SKU is a basic Jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand for the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) was [100, 66, 70, 62, 53], showing a downward trend or post-holiday normalization. Period 1 demand (41) continues this trend. To capture this recent lower demand regime, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 (covering Feb 4, Feb 11, and the current forecast context). Since the actual lead time is 0, L is set to default. Sigma will also use recent_N to reflect the stabilization in variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1330.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we experienced a significant stockout: demand was 107 units while only 70 were available (starting 59 + 11 arrived), leaving 37 units of unmet demand and 0 ending inventory. The historical demand shows a clear upward trend leading into late February (100, 66, 70, 62, 53, 41, 107). The recent 107 is much higher than the previous samples. For Period 3 (2019/2/25), as a basic Jersey T-shirt, we might be seeing the start of spring demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent spike (avg of 53, 41, 107 is 67) while remaining slightly cautious of the spike's magnitude. I'll use N=5 for sigma to account for the increased volatility seen in the last two periods. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on Period 1 and 2 completions, so I will stick with 'default'.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed at Period 2 (107 units), suggesting a transition from winter averages (~60) to higher spring demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 4 (2019/3/4). Analysis of the last two periods (P2: 107, P3: 106) confirms a significant demand regime shift compared to the initial historical samples (averaging ~70) and P1 (41). This shift correlates with the seasonal transition into spring for 'Cat Tee / T-shirt in soft jersey'. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (3 samples). With current on-hand inventory at 3 and a projected demand mean of ~107, we need to maintain higher base stock. Since the regime shift occurred at Period 2, I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat to focus on this new higher average (~106.5) and N=2 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility (though very low recently, 107 vs 106). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the spring season. Lead time remains 'calculate' as the 0-period promise is being met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 2: Average demand increased from ~65 (winter/early P1) to ~106.5 (spring transition), an approximately 64% increase.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/11. Demand analysis shows a clear shift starting Period 2 (Date 2019/2/18), aligning with the spring transition for a basic jersey T-shirt. Historical winter demand (Jan/early Feb) averaged ~70, while recent demand (P2-P4) averages ~98.67 (107, 106, 83). Period 4 saw a slight dip to 83, but since it is mid-March, overall demand is expected to remain high during the spring season. On-hand inventory is 25, with 0 in-transit. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (ordered and arrived same period). I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the post-shift performance (Periods 2, 3, 4) more heavily while discarding the lower winter samples. This will ensure the base_stock calculation reflects the current spring regime without being diluted by January data.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear shift starting in Period 2 (late Feb), with an average demand of approximately 91.75 units over the last 4 periods (107, 106, 83, 71), compared to the earlier winter average of ~65. While demand dropped slightly in Period 5 (71 units), it remains above the initial baseline. The 'Cat Tee' product is likely seeing early spring interest. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all completed orders. With 50 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current demand regime (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the sustained higher demand profile while accounting for the recent slight softening.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt', which is highly sensitive to the spring transition. Period 6 saw a massive demand spike to 147 units, depleting all 121 units of available stock (stockout). This confirms the 'spring transition' recorded in carry-over insights is accelerating as we hit late March. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P2-P6) is 102.8, but P6's 147 suggests the regime is shifting even higher. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-growth phase, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the higher spring mean, and use an explicit sigma_hat set to 30 to account for the increased volatility (147 vs average 102). Setting L to 0 (promised) as arrivals are consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating: Period 6 demand spiked to 147 (up from previous regime avg ~100), confirming a rapid spring/summer seasonal ramp-up.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are observing a sustained and accelerating upward demand trend for this Cat Tee as we transition into spring (April 1st). Demand has jumped significantly from early averages (~70) to the most recent periods (147 in P6, 177 in P7). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in three of the last six periods. The promised lead time of 0 periods has remained consistent in the concluding data. To capture the recent accelerating trend and seasonal ramp-up, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P5-P7), which averages 131.7 ((71+147+177)/3). However, given the specific trajectory (147 -> 177), I will use an 'explicit' value of 180 to ensure we don't stock out again during this peak transition. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this higher demand regime while smoothing the spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating into April: demand rose from ~100 in early March to 177 by March 25th (Period 7), confirming high spring/summer seasonality for basic t-shirts.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing a 'Cat Tee' (soft jersey t-shirt). Demand history shows a volatile spring ramp-up: demand spiked significantly in Period 6 (147) and Period 7 (177), followed by a pullback to 101 in Period 8. The average demand across these last three periods is approximately 142. Given the seasonal nature of basic t-shirts in April, we should maintain a high service level while respecting the recent pullback to avoid excessive holding costs. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture the current seasonal regime while smoothing the recent volatility, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (covering the 147, 177, 101 sequence) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to better reflect the increased variance observed during this spring transition. This setting targets a base stock level that covers the 140+ unit demand seen recently.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15th (Period 10). Historical demand for this 'Cat Tee' shows a transition from winter lows (~60) to a volatile spring ramp-up. We observed a peak of 177 units in Period 7 (March 25th), followed by a cooling to 101 and 85 in the last two periods. This suggests the initial spring surge may be stabilizing or oscillating. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Because demand has shifted from the early winter lows, I am using a recent window (N=4) to capture the higher spring mean (~128) and the increased volatility (Std Dev ~44). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the current demand regime without being skewed by the very low February data. With lead time = 0, the base stock targets (1+0) = 1 period of demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The SKU (Basic T-shirt) experienced a significant demand surge during late March (Period 6-7), peaking at 177 units. However, demand over the last three weeks (Periods 8-10) has stabilized at a lower level (101, 85, 84), averaging approximately 90 units per period. This suggests the initial spring surge has transitioned into a more stable mid-spring demand level. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. For Period 11, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this most recent stable regime (avg ~90). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 (covering both the peak and the stabilization) to ensure sufficient buffer for volatility as we enter late April. The current on-hand inventory (113) is slightly above one week's expected demand, so the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in April after late-March peak: Periods 8-10 average shifted to ~90 units/period down from ~140 in late March.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a 'Cat Tee' (jersey basic t-shirt), which is high-demand during the spring/summer transition. Historical demand analysis shows a highly volatile spring: an initial surge in late March (Period 7: 177 units) was followed by a stabilization period in April (Periods 8-10: ~90 units). Recent Period 11 saw demand rise again to 120 units, suggesting that as May approaches, demand is likely to remain high or increase further. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (39 on-hand, 0 in-transit). To capture the recent uptick and prepare for May demand, I will use a conservative recent window (N=4) for mu_hat (averaging ~102.5 per period) to balance the high spike of P11 against the slightly lower P8-P10, ensuring sufficient stock for the next period where demand is expected to be >= 100 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand entering May shows renewed strength: Period 11 demand (120) recovered from the April plateau (~90), indicating sustained high-season demand for jersey basics.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/05/06), we are entering the peak summer season for this jersey basic t-shirt. Historical data shows a mean demand of approximately 100 units/period over the last 5 periods (P8-P12: 101, 85, 84, 120, 94). While demand softened slightly in mid-April (P8-P10), the recovery in P11 (120) and steady demand in P12 (94) suggest a sustained high-demand regime relative to the winter months. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stabilized high-season mean (~97) and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected 100+ units for the current period while maintaining a high service level (q = 19/20 = 95%) appropriate for a high-margin basic item.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (May 13, 2019). The product is a soft jersey t-shirt, which is in high seasonal demand during spring and summer. Historical demand has been volatile: after a late-March peak (177), demand settled into a lower-range plateau in April (~90) and has recently fluctuated between 67 and 120 in the last three periods (Avg: 93.7). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. While Period 13 demand was lower (67), May is a peak month for jersey basics, so we should maintain a robust stock level to avoid stockouts seen earlier in the season. I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (Avg: 91.8) and sigma_hat to capture the current post-April-peak regime while accounting for May volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation effectively covers the upcoming week's demand with an appropriate safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in May: Following the April plateau (~90), May demand is fluctuating between 67 and 120, suggesting a slightly higher but more variable baseline than April.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Cat Tee' (Jersey Basic) has entered a stable but somewhat volatile phase following the high spring peaks of late March. For the last 3 periods (P12-P14), demand has been 94, 67, and 74 (average ~78), which represents a cooling from the late-March spike (~140) and early-April plateau (~90-100). Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period inventory adjustments. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current late-spring demand levels (average ~86), which balances the stronger pull from Period 11 with the recent moderate weeks. This provides a buffer against volatility while avoiding excess holding costs as we move further into the season. The critical service level target remains high (q \u2248 0.95), justifying the use of recent standard deviation to set the safety stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 27th (Period 16). The product is a jersey t-shirt, which is currently in high season. Demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 11-15) has averaged 93.8 units/period (120, 94, 67, 74, 117), showing significant volatility but a steady high-season baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (5 units), having been depleted by a demand spike of 117 in the previous period. The OR backend needs to replenish stock to cover the upcoming week's demand plus a safety margin. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current late-spring demand profile, ensuring mu_hat reflects the recent average of ~94 and sigma_hat accounts for the high variance observed in May (standard deviation of ~22). This will provide a base stock around 130 units to prevent stockouts during potential spikes.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3rd. We are managing a basic jersey t-shirt, which is in high seasonal demand during the summer months. Historical demand shows clear growth from winter levels (~60) to a more volatile spring/early summer regime. In Period 16 (late May), demand spiked to 138, exceeding our starting inventory and resulting in a stockout. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), the average demand has been 98 units, but the most recent two periods (P15-P16) have surged to an average of 127.5. Given we are entering June, I expect demand to remain at this higher level or increase further. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and capture the June seasonal peak, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high-demand regime, while adjusting sigma_hat to reflect high volatility observed in May (standard deviation of ~29 over the last 5 periods). L remains at the promised 0 periods as actual lead time has consistently matched promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Summer peak confirmed with late-May demand averaging 128 units, a significant increase from the April/early-May plateau of ~90 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in June, entering the peak of the summer season for 'Cat Tee' (soft jersey t-shirts). Historical demand data and carry-over insights confirm a significant summer ramp-up. Specifically, the last two periods (P16 and P17) have seen a stockout with demand reaching 138 and 154 units respectively, exceeding our starting inventory. The average demand since the confirmed shift at Period 15 (P15-P17) is approximately 136 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($19 vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the current high-demand summer regime, and sigma_hat using the same recent window to capture the increased volatility of this peak season.

Carry-over insight: High summer demand sustained: Periods 15-17 average demand rose to ~136 units (specifically 117, 138, 154), confirming the predicted summer peak for jersey basics.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019, which is peak summer season for 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts. Reviewing the demand history, we transitioned from a springtime baseline of ~90 units (Periods 8-14) to a significant summer regime shift starting at Period 15. The recent demand for Periods 15-18 has been 117, 138, 154, and 129 units respectively, resulting in a 4-period average of 134.5 units per period. This represents a sustained 50% increase over the previous regime. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. Given the high profitability ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) and the recent stockouts in Periods 16 and 17, I will continue to focus on this recent summer regime (N=4) to ensure high service levels during the peak. Inventory is currently low (38 units on-hand), necessitating a strong replenishment order to meet the forecasted demand of ~135 units plus safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime fully established: Periods 15-18 average demand is 134.5 units, a 50% increase over the April/May average of ~90 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are in the heart of the summer season for 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts. Demand has remained consistently high, with the last four periods showing demand of 138, 154, 129, and 165 (mean ~146.5). We ended Period 19 with 0 on-hand inventory due to high demand exceeding available stock, leading to lost sales. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this summer peak and prevent stockouts, I will use a recent demand window (N=5) to reflect the current regime of ~140+ units per period. Using N=5 captures the jump from the 117-120 range into the current 130-160 range. mu_hat will be set via recent_N (N=5) to provide a localized mean of roughly 140. sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the higher volatility seen in these peak periods (129 to 165), ensuring a sufficient buffer.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand solidified in June: Average demand for Periods 16-19 is 146.5 units, compared to the May average of ~114 units (28% increase).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-07-01 (Period 21), marking the peak of the summer season for this 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt. Historical data from the last 5 periods (Periods 16-20) shows a sustained high-demand regime with an average of 145.8 units per period (138, 154, 129, 165, 143) and a standard deviation of approximately 14 units. This is significantly higher than the spring average (~90-100 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit and avoid stockouts during this peak summer window\u2014especially after three stockouts in the last five periods (P16, P17, P19)\u2014I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the full summer regime. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the higher volatility observed in this high-volume period, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock level sufficient to cover the 95th percentile of expected demand (calculated as mu + 1.645 * sigma).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand maintained through late June: Period 16-20 average demand is 145.8 units, sustaining the ~145-150 unit regime identified in mid-June.

The demand in Period 21 surged to 206 units, the highest recorded to date, confirming the sustained high-summer regime. Throughout Periods 16-21, the average demand is 155.8 units with significant volatility (std dev ~27.5). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods (same-period arrival). With current on-hand inventory at 0 and entering the hottest weeks of July, I must ensure the base stock covers this heightened demand regime plus a safety buffer for volatility. I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the summer peak regime starting mid-June, ensuring the inventory targets the most recent and relevant sales velocity (avg ~156 units) rather than the lower averages from spring or winter.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak intensified in July: Period 21 demand reached a new high of 206 units. The mid-summer regime (Periods 16-21) average is ~156 units, a 15% increase over the previous June average of ~135.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand dropped to 113 units following the Period 21 peak of 206. This suggests that while we are in the peak summer season (July), the extremely high demand in Period 21 may have been a local spike or the start of higher volatility. The average demand for the most recent regime (Periods 16-22) is approximately 150 units. We are currently at 2019/07/15, which is deeply within the summer high season for 'soft jersey t-shirts'. To avoid stockouts seen in Period 21 while accounting for the lower Period 22 demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 samples (N=7), which covers the transition and current peak regime, averaging ~150 units. sigma_hat will also be set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the increased volatility (206 vs 113) observed in July. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand volatility observed: Demand dropped to 113 units in Period 22 after a peak of 206 in Period 21. The late-summer regime (Periods 16-22) maintains an average of ~150 units with increased variance.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in its peak summer season (July 22nd). However, demand in the last two periods (P22: 113, P23: 79) has shown a significant slowdown compared to the early July peak of 206 (P21). This suggests that while we are in the high-demand window, the extreme peak may have passed, or we are experiencing mid-summer volatility. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P16-P23) is approximately 141 units. Considering the recent sharp drop to 79, a more conservative recent window is appropriate to avoid overstocking as we move toward the end of summer. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the average of the last 5 periods (~130 units), which balances the peak in P21 with the recent cooling. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility (range of 79 to 206) observed in this regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand volatility observed: Demand dropped from a peak of 206 (P21) to 113 (P22) and 79 (P23). This may signal the passing of the absolute summer peak or significant secondary volatility in the July peak regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1518.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late July/early August. Historically, demand for this 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' peaked in early July (P21: 206) and has since shown a downward trend (P22: 113, P23: 79, P24: 87). This decline suggests the passing of the peak summer retail season and a transition toward late-summer/pre-fall demand levels. The average demand over the last three periods (P22-P24) is approximately 93 units, which is significantly lower than the June/early-July peak of ~150 units but consistent with the spring plateau observed in April/May (~90 units). Given the high profit/holding cost ratio ($19/$1), the OR engine will target a high service level. To avoid overstocking while the seasonal demand cools, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent decline (averaging ~95 units) and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for the heightened volatility observed during this transition phase. On-hand inventory is currently healthy (135 units), which covers estimated demand for the next period, so the system will likely place a small replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: Summer peak has passed. Demand transitioned from a June/July peak of ~150 units to a late-summer average of ~93 units (Periods 22-24), representing a ~38% decrease.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' is transitioning from its summer peak (which reached up to 206 units in July) into a lower late-summer/early-autumn regime. Demand over the last four periods (P22-P25) has averaged ~90.5 units (113, 79, 87, 83), a significant drop from the June/July average of ~150. Given the date is August 5th, I anticipate this lower demand level to persist as back-to-school season approaches and summer clearances typically begin. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new, lower-volume regime while ignoring the high-volatility summer peaks. On-hand inventory is currently healthy (135 units), which covers approximately 1.5 periods of the current demand rate. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime confirmed: Average demand for late July / early August (Periods 22-25) has stabilized at ~91 units, down from the summer peak of ~150 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical demand shows a confirmed regime shift following the summer peak (June/July). Demand has dropped from a peak average of ~150 units to a more stable late-summer/early-autumn level. Specifically, demand for the last five periods (P22-P26) has been: 113, 79, 87, 83, and 60. This reflects a clear downward trend and stabilization near a lower mean. To capture this 'post-summer' regime (starting Period 22), I will set N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the average of the most recent observations (~84 units) while allowing the OR backend to account for the current volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed throughout the history.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt shows a clear seasonal cycle: a winter baseline of ~60-65 units, a spring/summer peak reaching over 150-200 units (Periods 16-21), and a significant post-summer drop starting in Period 22. In the last six periods (P22-P27), demand has averaged 80 units (113, 79, 87, 83, 60, 57). The last two periods specifically (60, 57) suggest a return to the early-year baseline of ~60 units as summer ends. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this late-summer stabilization while acknowledging the downward trend. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the summer peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization: Demand has returned to a baseline of ~60-80 units (average 80 over P22-P27), mirroring early-year/winter levels after the summer peak (~150).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 28 spiked significantly to 178 units, contradicting the 'post-summer stabilization' observed in Periods 22-27 (avg ~80). This suggests either a late summer clearance event, back-to-school shopping (late August), or significant volatility. Given the date (August 26) and product (Jersey Basic T-shirt), a back-to-school spike is highly probable. I will shift the forecast upward to account for this recent spike while acknowledging high volatility. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this transition (Periods 25-28: 83, 60, 57, 178), resulting in an average of 94.5. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand spike detected: Period 28 demand rose to 178, breaking the post-summer plateau of ~80 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490001' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is experiencing a powerful Back-to-School demand spike in late August. Period 28 saw demand jump to 178, and Period 29 saw it surge further to 248. This confirms a new high-demand regime, likely peaking around Labor Day (the current period, 2019/9/2). Given that the previous two weeks saw substantial lost sales due to stockouts (sold 114 against 178 demand, and 189 against 248 demand), I must set parameters to capture this peak while preparing for a potential post-holiday taper. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 250 to cover the expected peak demand for Period 30, and an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to account for the high volatility seen during these transition weeks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Back-to-School demand surge confirmed: Period 28-29 demand averaged 213 units, a 166% increase over the August baseline of ~80 units, reflecting peak seasonality for jersey basics.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September (Period 31), following a significant Back-to-School (BTS) demand peak in late August (Periods 28-29, averaging 213 units). Period 30 data (131 units) suggests the extreme BTS peak is tapering, but demand remains elevated compared to the early August baseline (~60-80 units). Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Based on the product category (Jersey Basic T-shirt), demand typically remains moderately high through September before transitioning to autumn/winter levels. I will use the average of the last 3 periods (P28-P30) to calculate mu_hat, which yields (178+248+131)/3 = 185.6 units per period. This captures the recent high-volume surge while acknowledging the start of the post-BTS decline. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 3 periods to account for the high volatility observed during the seasonal shift (standard deviation of {178, 248, 131} is ~58.5). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 202 units, which covers slightly more than one period of the forecasted demand.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School peak (late August) has begun to decelerate: Period 30 demand (131) is lower than the P28-29 peak (avg 213) but remains significantly higher than the pre-BTS August baseline (~70).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the jersey basic t-shirt reached a significant peak during the Back-to-School (BTS) period (P28-P29, averaging 213 units) and is now clearly decelerating as we move into mid-September. The last two periods (P30-P31) recorded demands of 131 and 77, respectively. On-hand inventory is currently high at 206 units, which is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the next period, especially since the recent trend suggests a return to a lower baseline similar to the post-summer/pre-BTS plateau (~80 units). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (average ~138) provides a safe transition forecast, while sigma_hat with recent_N=5 captures the high volatility experienced during the BTS surge to protect against stockouts if there's a secondary late-September bump. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School peak concluded: Demand dropped from an average of 213 (P28-P29) to 77 by Period 31, indicating a return toward the autumn baseline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Back-to-school (BTS) demand peaked in late August (Periods 28-29, average 213) and has now successfully returned to an autumn baseline. Over the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has been 131, 77, and 100, averaging approximately 103 units, which is consistent with the 'jersey basic' category after mid-September. The 'Carry-over Insight' from P32 correctly identifies the conclusion of the BTS peak. Currently, on-hand inventory is 180 units. With a promised lead time of 0, confirmed by all history showing same-period arrival, I am setting L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this new post-BTS regime (avg ~103). Given the recent drop from high volatility (BTS) to a more stable autumn baseline, sigma_hat will also be based on these last 3 periods to prevent over-ordering based on the now-irrelevant BTS surge. The OR backend will see that on-hand (180) is likely sufficient to cover the base stock for the next period, potentially resulting in a small or zero order to burn off the surplus from the P30/P31 safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline established: Following the BTS peak of ~213 units, demand for Periods 30-32 has stabilized at an average of 103 units, representing the post-peak autumn regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3420.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Back-to-School demand peak (late August/early September) has fully concluded, and we are now into late September/early October. Period 33 demand spiked unexpectedly to 191 units, which could be a late-season promotional effect or early autumn variance. However, the last 4 periods (P30-P33) show demand of 131, 77, 100, and 191, yielding an average of approximately 125 units. This is slightly higher than the autumn baseline previously estimated (~103 units). I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this recent volatility while respecting the likely shift back to a standard baseline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the high variance observed between Period 31 (77) and Period 33 (191). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Renewed autumn volatility detected. Period 33 demand (191) significantly exceeded the expected autumn baseline (~100), suggesting potential secondary peaks or promotional spikes in late September.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is entering early October. Historically, we have seen a summer peak followed by a significant Back-to-School (BTS) surge in late August/early September. Most recently, Period 33 showed a sharp spike to 191 units, followed by a drop to 83 units in Period 34. This suggests a highly volatile autumn regime where demand fluctuates between a baseline of ~80 and occasional spikes near 200. The carry-over insights correctly identified this 'renewed autumn volatility'. Currently, on-hand inventory is 124 units. To handle another potential spike while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit vs $19 profit), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) which captures the post-BTS stabilization and the recent volatility (average ~116 per period). L remains at the promised 0 periods as actual lead times consistently match. Sigma_hat is calculated from the same recent period to account for the high volatility seen in the last three weeks.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand volatility confirmed: Periods 32-34 show demand of 100, 191, and 83, indicating a wide range (~80-200) following the BTS peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts is entering mid-October (Period 36), moving into the late autumn regime. Recent demand history shows significant volatility: Period 33 spiked to 191, but Periods 34 and 35 settled lower at 83 and 59, respectively. This follows the conclusion of the Back-to-School peaks. The current on-hand inventory is 135 units. Given the recent drop to 59 units, there is a risk of holding too much inventory if demand continues to soften toward early winter levels (~60-70 units). However, the 'autumn baseline' identified in the carry-over insights (avg ~103) suggests we should maintain a moderate safety stock to cover potential secondary spikes like that seen in P33. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat (covering P32-P35: 100, 191, 83, 59; avg ~108) to capture the current autumn mean while balancing the recent downward trend against the earlier spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Cat Tee' (Jersey Basic) has entered a stable autumn regime following the volatile Back-to-School (BTS) period. Recent demand samples (P32-P36) are 100, 191, 83, 59, and 108 units. While P33 showed a spike (191), the surrounding periods suggest a baseline centered around 90-110 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With the current date of October 21st, there are no immediate major retail holidays expected to spike demand for basic tees until pre-holiday or Black Friday preparations, which usually occur in November. Therefore, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current autumn mean, which averages ~108 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the variance seen during this autumn transition (stdev \u2248 50). This strategy ensures we maintain enough stock for potential secondary spikes while avoiding excessive holding costs on a low-margin basic item.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Periods 32-36 average ~108 units, fluctuating between 59 and 191, following the BTS peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019, late autumn. Demand for this jersey basic t-shirt has stabilized following the Back-to-School surge (P28-29) and late September volatility (P33). Over the last 6 periods (P32-P37), demand has averaged 111.5 units (100, 191, 83, 59, 108, 128), which aligns with the identified autumn baseline of ~110. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods to capture the current autumn regime's mean and its observed volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the baseline demand and the occasional spikes seen in this period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November. Historically, demand for this 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt stabilized after the late September/early October volatility. The recent regime (Periods 35-38) shows demand levels of 59, 108, 128, and 114, averaging 102.25 units. While we are approaching the holiday season, there isn't yet a sustained upward shift in this specific 'Basics' category to justify a higher forecast. Therefore, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current post-autumn stability while maintaining enough safety stock (via sigma_hat) to handle the observed variance (~100-130 range). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for highly responsive ordering.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a post-Back-to-School autumn regime. Recent demand (Periods 35-39) has been 59, 108, 128, 114, 95, representing a stable baseline of approximately 101 units per period. The earlier volatility seen in September (P33: 191) appears to have subsided into a consistent autumn level. Lead time has reliably remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of the last 5 periods (N=5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime without being skewed by the high-volume August/September peaks. With a lead time of 0, on-hand inventory should aim to cover the current period's demand (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3). Current on-hand is 57, and expected demand is ~101, so an order should increase availability to meet this level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Periods 35-39 average 100.8 units, showing significantly lower volatility than the September transition period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (2019/11/18), the inventory for SKU 717490001 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is 23 units. Historical data indicates that lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. Recent demand for the autumn regime (Periods 35-40) has stabilized with an average of approximately 101 units per period (59, 108, 128, 114, 95, 121), showing lower volatility compared to the earlier transition period. With the game approaching late November, we must account for stable autumn demand while preparing for potential Black Friday or pre-holiday spikes common in basic apparelcategories. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this stable autumn baseline (avg ~101) and using sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to reflect current volatility. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 0 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), demand for 'Jersey Basic T-shirts' is showing a late-autumn upward trend. Demand in Period 41 was 141 units, following 121 in Period 40, surpassing the previously stabilized autumn average of ~100. This increase likely reflects early holiday shopping or winter layering demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this recent shift and avoid stockouts during this potential surge, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to focus on the data since Period 38 (demand: 114, 95, 121, 141). This provides a more responsive mean of ~118 units vs the long-term autumn average of 100.

Carry-over insight: Renewed demand uptick detected in late November: Periods 40-41 demand averaged 131 units, up from the October/early-November baseline of ~100 units (+31%).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43), entering the peak holiday season. Demand has shown a clear upward trend over the last three periods (121, 141, 174), specifically spiking to 174 in Period 42. Since this is a 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt, it is likely benefiting from holiday shopping or gifting. The previous autumn baseline of ~100 has shifted significantly. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this holiday acceleration (averaging ~145 units per period). Due to the high risk of stockouts during this surge (ending inventory was 0 last period), I will increase sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to better account for the high volatility seen during seasonal transitions (83-174 range). Lead time 'L' remains 0 as confirmed by the P42 concluding message.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed starting Period 41: Demand increased from an autumn baseline of ~100 to an average of ~158 units (Periods 41-42), representing a 58% increase heading into December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the December holiday season (Dec 9). Period 42 showed a peak demand of 174, followed by a significant drop to 42 in Period 43. This drop is likely a temporary anomaly or a specific post-Black Friday lull before the final pre-Christmas surge. My 'Carry-over' notes confirm a holiday surge began at Period 41, with demand averaging ~158 units across P41-P42. The current 146 units on hand (from the 188 ordered last period minus 42 sold) provides a buffer, but given the critical timing (two weeks before Christmas), I must maintain a base stock that accounts for high volatility and potential 'last-minute' demand spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the high 174 demand to the low 42 demand, which averages to 119. This balances the risk of a late-season surge against the risk of overstocking as we approach the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: Period 42 peak (174) followed by Period 43 dip (42) suggests high variance during the December retail window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $548.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Historical data shows a clear shift in demand around the holiday season. While Periods 41-42 showed a significant surge (avg ~158), Periods 43-44 saw a sharp drop to an average of ~40 units. This pattern suggests a pre-holiday buying peak followed by a mid-December lull, common in retail for basic jersey t-shirts as focus shifts to gifting or seasonal wear. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 193 units, which safely covers several periods of current low demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the volatility of the December window (avg 99, but with high variance), ensuring the base stock level remains responsive to any late-December/Year-end clearance spikes without over-ordering given the high ending inventory.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand pattern refined: Early Dec peak (P41-42 avg 158) followed by mid-Dec lull (P43-44 avg 40), indicating high variance within the holiday retail window for jersey staples.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), which is just before Christmas. Historically, we saw a holiday surge in Period 42 (174 units), followed by a significant drop in demand during mid-December (Periods 43-45 averaged ~44 units). Given the timing (Dec 23), we are likely at the very end of the holiday shopping window or entering the post-holiday lull. Demand for 'Jersey Basic' T-shirts typically remains low after the pre-Christmas peak before potentially picking up for New Year's or January clearance. Our on-hand inventory is 163 units, which is quite high compared to the recent three-week average demand of ~44. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for any minor end-of-year lift, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current low-demand lull, and use the default sigma_hat to account for the overall historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand decline confirmed: Periods 43-45 average demand dropped to 43.7 units, down 72% from the late-November/early-December peak of ~158 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on 2019-12-30, representing the transition from the end-of-year holiday season into the new year. Historical data for this jersey basic SKU (717490001) shows a significant demand cooling after the early-December holiday push. Demand in the last four periods (P43-P46) has been 42, 39, 50, and 33 units, respectively. This confirms the post-holiday decline identified in 'Carry-over Insights'. The current on-hand inventory is 130 units, which more than covers three periods of the current ~40-unit demand regime. Given that the promised and historical lead time is 0 periods, the current stock is sufficient. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent four-period average (~41 units) and use a recent_N window for sigma_hat to capture the decreased volatility compared to the high-variance December window. L remains at the default of 0.
