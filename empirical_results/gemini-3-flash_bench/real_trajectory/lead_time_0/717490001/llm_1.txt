(e) To avoid a stockout in Period 1 (where demand resolution happens after my decision), I need to place an order immediately.

I expect demand to hover around 50-60 units. Calculation: Targeted stock for P2 ~ 70 units. On hand = 29. Order = 70 - 29 = 41.

  "rationale": "The SKU '717490001' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a post-holiday low-demand phase. Historical data from Period 43 to 45 (December) shows demand has plummeted from a late November peak of 174 to an average of just 43.7 units per period. The current date is December 23, 2019. Retail logic suggests that demand will remain low during the final week of the year and into the early New Year ('January baseline'), which previously showed demand around 40-60 units (P1-P5). With an on-hand inventory of 149 units, I already have enough stock to cover more than 3 periods of the current low-demand regime without ordering additional units. Reducing inventory now avoids unnecessary holding costs during the seasonal trough.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-holiday demand regime (December 2019) is confirmed at a significantly lower mean of ~44 units (Avg P43-P45), reflecting a sharp decline after the late-November peak.",

  "rationale": "The product is a Jersey Basic T-shirt. Current calendar date is December 30, 2019. Historically, demand for this SKU follows strong seasonal patterns: a spring surge (March), a summer peak (June/July), and a significant Back-to-School spike (August). Since the late November/Black Friday peak (174 units), demand has crashed into a low-volume December regime. The average demand over the last four periods (P43-P46) is 41 units (42, 39, 50, 33). This aligns with the 'post-holiday demand crash' identified in carrying insights. Lead time remains 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is 116 units, which is approximately 2.8 weeks of current demand coverage. Given the low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19), it is prudent to maintain some safety stock, but as we are in the deepest part of the winter trough, no additional ordering is required. The current stock is sufficient to cover early January demand even if a slight uptick occurs.",
