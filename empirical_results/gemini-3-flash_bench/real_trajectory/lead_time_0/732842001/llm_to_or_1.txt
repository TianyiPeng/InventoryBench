Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-02-11. The product is a pair of 'Embrace' High Waist Super Skinny jeans, a staple denim item. Looking at the historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4), there is a significant and aggressive upward trend: 0, 1, 36, 100, 215. This suggests the product has recently launched or is scaling up rapidly in early spring. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The promised lead time is 0. Since the demand is accelerating sharply, using a full-history average (default) would severely underestimate current need. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent growth while keeping the lead time at 0 (default). This helps the OR backend establish a base stock that reflects the current high-growth regime (avg of 36, 100, 215 is roughly 117 per period).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans. Historical demand data shows a sharp upward trend: 0 -> 1 -> 36 -> 100 -> 215. Period 1 demand was 167. This pattern indicates we have moved from a launch phase into a high-growth phase, likely coinciding with February fashion trends or seasonal shifts. In Period 1, we ordered 117 units which arrived immediately (lead_time=0), but demand was 167, leading to 50 lost sales and 0 ending inventory. Given the consistent and rapid demand growth over the last 4 weeks (36 -> 100 -> 215 -> 167), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this higher mean while acknowledging the slight dip from week 5 to Period 1. Setting L to 'calculate' to track the 0-period lead time. Mu_hat and Sigma_hat will use the last 4 samples to reflect the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: rapid growth from near-zero to triple digits starting late January 2019. Average demand over the last 4 weeks is approximately 129 units.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842001' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a high-growth demand phase. Historical data shows demand rising from 0 in early January to 215 by Feb 4th. Recent game history confirms high demand (167 in P1, 156 in P2). Each period so far has resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0), indicating that the OR backend's default 'cap' or base_stock calculations are undershooting actual demand due to the rapid trend. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods via 'conclude' messages. To prevent continued stockouts and maximize profit, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 215 (the highest historical value) to ensure the base_stock calculation covers current peak demand levels, as the recent average (130-160) is still trailing the growth seen in early February.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateauing at high levels (150-200 units/week) following rapid growth phase in Jan-Feb 2019; lead time consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized following a rapid growth phase in late January/early February. Over the last four weeks (Period 3 back to late pre-game data), demand samples were 215, 167, 156, and 125. This yields a recent mean of 165.75. Although the most recent demand (125) was lower, the product description (skinny high-waist jeans) suggests a staple item for spring. Since lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, the OR backend requires parameters for (L+1) = 1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stable high-demand regime established in the last month while smoothing out the volatility of the most recent drop to 125. The equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each) implies an optimal service level (q) of 0.5 (z=0), meaning the OR-calculated base stock will effectively target the mean demand. Current on-hand is 90, so the system will order approximately 165 - 90 = 75 units.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Super Skinny High Waist' denim SKU showed a rapid growth phase reaching a peak of 215 in early February, and has since stabilized/plateaued. Demand over the last four periods (Periods 1-4) has been 167, 156, 125, and 117 respectively, averaging 141.25. The trend shows a slight cooling from the peak. Lead time is definitively 0 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1-4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime while reflecting the recent downward drift from the absolute peak. This will help the OR backend set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~141 units plus a safety buffer, avoiding excessive holding costs given the $1:$1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (which implies a 50% target service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand plateauing/stabilizing: after late Jan growth, Feb-March demand averages ~141 units/week (down from peak of 215). Lead time confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18, 2019. Historical data for this skinny jeans item shows a clear demand trajectory: it surged in late January (0 to 215) and has since stabilized/slightly cooled through February and March. The last four demand samples (Periods 2-5) are 156, 125, 117, and 103, showing a steady decline from the February peak but maintaining a triple-digit baseline with an average of 125. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, effectively targeting the median demand to minimize total cost. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilization phase, as using the full history (including the early near-zero samples or the extreme 215 peak) would bias the forecast. N=4 covers the entire stabilized period after the initial surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: post-peak demand (Periods 2-5) fluctuates between 103-156 units, averaging 125. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product is a staple item (Ladies Denim). Historical demand shows a stabilization phase after an initial peak in February. Over the last three weeks (Periods 4-6), demand has been very consistent: 117, 103, and 115, averaging ~112 units per week. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data (Periods 1-6) confirms that orders consistently arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5 (profit / (profit + holding_cost)), meaning the base stock target should be slightly above the mean demand. I will use the last 3 samples (N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime, and set L to default (0).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' skinny jeans, which typically shows steady year-round demand with slight peaks in spring. Historical demand since the stabilization in mid-February (Periods 1-7) has been relatively stable, ranging from 103 to 167 units, with a recent 4-week average (Periods 4-7) of 111.75 units. Period 7 saw a demand of 112, leaving 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, as every order placed has arrived within the same period. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand regime since mid-February, excluding the initial hyper-growth phase in January.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Super-Skinny High-Waist Trash' denim SKU showed an initial peak in early February (215 units) but has since stabilized. In the most recent period (Period 8), demand dropped significantly to 57 units, compared to the previous 7-period average of ~114 units. This could be a temporary fluctuation or a shift in the post-peak trend. However, with profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) being equal, the OR backend aims for a 50% service level (z=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 71 units, which is higher than the last period's demand. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach to capture the current stabilizing trend while acknowledging the recent drop. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans shows a downward trend over the last two periods (57 and 72 units), compared to the earlier post-growth stabilization average of ~120 units. This decline matches a typical post-spring-launch cooling period for fashion denim. In Period 9, the system ordered 26 units with lead_time=0, which arrived and resulted in an ending inventory of 25. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the recent drop, I am shifting the mu_hat focus to the last 3 periods (average ~81 units) to avoid over-ordering and incurring holding costs (which equal the unit profit). I will use N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent deceleration in demand velocity while maintaining the lead time at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed starting early April 2019: average demand dropped to ~75 units/week across Periods 8-9 from a previous stable mean of 125 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' (denim trousers) has shown a clear cooling trend throughout April. Looking at the last three periods (Periods 8, 9, and 10), demand values were 57, 72, and 63, averaging approximately 64 units per week. This is a significant drop from the March average of ~112 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded period in history. The on-hand inventory is currently low at 18 units. To avoid stockouts while adjusting to the lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3. This allows the OR engine to react quickly to the lower mean (~64) and reduced variance observed in April, ensuring base stock levels align with the current trend rather than the higher Q1 activity.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' skinny jeans. Historically, demand for this SKU peaked in early 2019 (reaching 167 units in February) and has since cooled. Over the last four periods (Periods 8-11), demand has averaged 72.5 units (57, 72, 63, 98), compared to the earlier stabilization mean of ~125. However, Period 11 saw a significant rebound to 98 units, causing a stockout as on-hand inventory was insufficient. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.50, meaning the OR engine should target the median demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. To prevent consecutive stockouts following the Period 11 surge, I will use a recent_N window of 4 for mu_hat to capture the recent cooling while reflecting the latest uptick, and a window of 4 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound observed in late April (Period 11: 98 units) interrupting the cooling trend (avg 64 units in Periods 8-10); monitoring if this marks a new spring seasonal uptick.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' ladies' denim product shows a clear seasonal rebound starting in late April (Period 11: 98, Period 12: 110), following a dip in early April. This aligns with spring fashion cycles. I am currently out of stock as of the end of Period 12 due to demand exceeding supply (we sold out all 73 units ordered in P12 against a demand of 110). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this upward trend while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a recent window of 5 periods (Periods 8-12: demand 57, 72, 63, 98, 110) which captures both the dip and the recovery. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on a mean of 80 units for (1+L) periods. Given the stockouts in the last two periods, I will stick with recent data to ensure the base stock is responsive to the current uptick.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound confirmed: late April and early May show sustained growth (Period 11: 98, Period 12: 110) from early April lows (avg ~64), suggesting a peak spring season for ladies' denim.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny' ladies' denim is currently in a spring rebound phase. After bottoming at an average of ~64 units in early April (Periods 8-10), demand increased to an average of 99 units over the last three weeks (P11: 98, P12: 110, P13: 89). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given that profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which corresponds to targeting the median demand (z=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current spring demand level (~99 units per period) and stay responsive to the recent uptick without over-ordering based on the much higher February peaks.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842001' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a period of stockouts due to high demand exceeding orders. Current date is 2019-05-20. In the last four periods (Periods 11-14), demand has been consistently high (98, 110, 89, 108), averaging approximately 101 units per week, whereas my previous orders were based on lower historical averages. Inventory is currently zero. To prevent continued lost sales during this late-spring seasonal peak, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this recent regime using N=4. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. By setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will target a base stock sufficient to cover this elevated demand level plus safety stock for the high volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand peak confirmed: Period 11-14 demand averaged 101 units, a ~58% increase from early April lows (Periods 8-10 avg: 64).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' (Ladies Denim) has stabilized at a higher level after a spring peak, with the last 5 periods (P11-P15) showing demands of 98, 110, 89, 108, and 99. The average demand for this stabilized spring/summer regime is approximately 101 units per week. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as every order placed in the game history arrived in the same period it was ordered. On-hand inventory is currently very low (3 units) and there is no inventory in-transit. To avoid lost sales during this stable demand phase, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this current regime, and use the same window for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. The L parameter is set to 0 (default) to match historical performance.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 3, 2019, the item 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' (Ladies' Denim) is showing signs of cooling after a sustained spring peak. Period 16 demand dropped significantly to 60 units, compared to the previously observed spring peak average of ~101 units (Periods 11-14). This drop aligns with a potential early-summer transition for denim. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which match profit at $1/unit), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to a recent window (last 6 periods) to capture both the peak and the recent downturn, while providing enough sigma to guard against remaining volatility. N=6 covers the period from May 2019 to now, reflecting the most relevant recent seasonal behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed in late May/early June: Period 16 demand (60 units) is ~40% lower than the April/May spring peak average (~101 units), possibly indicating a seasonal shift away from heavy denim as summer begins.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for this ladies' denim SKU has significantly dropped over the last two weeks (P16: 60, P17: 45), compared to the April/May spring peak average of ~101. This aligns with a seasonal transition into summer where heavy, 'hard-worn' denim typically cools off. Average demand over the last 3 periods (P15-P17) is approximately 68 units, but the last two periods show a clear downward trend. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to quickly capture this cooling trend while maintaining safety stock (sigma_hat) based on the same stable regime. Given current on-hand inventory of 49 and the downward demand trend, the OR backend will calculate a modest order to prevent overstocking during this lower demand cycle.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand cooling confirmed: Demand in late May/early June (P16-P17) dropped to an average of ~53 units, a significant ~48% reduction from the spring peak (April/May avg ~101).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842001' (Ladies Denim jeans) is currently in a summer seasonal decline. Historical demand peaked during the spring (late April/May) at ~101 units/week, but has dropped significantly over the last three periods to 60, 45, and 38 units respectively. This aligns with a shift in consumer preference toward lighter garments as summer temperatures rise. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P16-P18) is approximately 47.6 units. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0), the backend OR engine will target a 50% service level (z=0), effectively ordering up to the mean demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this downward trend while maintaining enough for current demand, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent cooling regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842001' (Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash Ladies Denim) is experiencing a seasonal cooling phase as we enter summer (late June). Demand has dropped from a spring peak of ~100 units/week to a low of 34-45 units/week in the most recent periods (P16-P19). The average demand over the last four periods (P16: 60, P17: 45, P18: 38, P19: 34) is approximately 44 units, with a clear downward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this decline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture this lower volume, while maintaining an explicit L of 0. This approach balances the stock-out risk against the high potential for excess holding costs during a seasonal downtrend.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842001' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a sustained seasonal decline as summer progresses. Demand has dropped consistently from a spring peak of ~101 units (Periods 11-14) to a recent 5-period average (Periods 16-20) of approximately 39.6 units. The most recent demand was only 21 units. Based on this cooling trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this lower volume, ensuring we don't overstock. sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, which is captured by the default method.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand cooling confirmed: Demand from mid-June to early July (Periods 18-20) has stabilized at a lower average of ~31 units compared to the early June average of ~53 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8, 2019. Demand has recently stabilized at a lower mid-summer level, although Period 21 saw a slight uptick to 54 units (potentially a small Independence Day holiday effect or general variance), which resulted in a stockout as the on-hand inventory was insufficient. Looking at the regime since mid-June (Periods 18-21), demand values are [38, 34, 21, 54], averaging 36.75. This is lower than the early June average (~53) and significantly lower than the spring peak (~101). Given the current zero-inventory status, I will use a N=4 window to capture this summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. The product is ladies' super-skinny denim. Historical demand showed a significant late-spring peak (~100 units/week) followed by a mid-summer cooling (Periods 18-20 averaged ~31 units). However, the last two periods (P21-P22) have shown a substantial and sudden demand uptick (54 and 65 units respectively), likely signaling a 'Back to School' early demand surge or a mid-summer sale event. This contradicts the previous cooling trend. My objective is to capture this new upward momentum without over-reacting to potential noise. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (averaging the last three periods: 21, 54, 65 \u2248 46.7 units/period) and sigma_hat to pivot quickly toward this new demand level. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the OR target service level is 50%, making accurate mean estimation critical.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand rebound detected: Periods 21-22 show demand increasing to ~60 units/week from the P18-20 average of ~31 units (+93%), likely marking the start of a late-summer/back-to-school trend.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 732842001 (Ladies Denim) is currently in Period 24 (July 22, 2019). We previously identified a rebound in demand starting in Period 21, likely related to late-summer or back-to-school shopping. Period 23 saw a demand drop to 31 units following two stronger weeks (54 and 65), which may be a temporary fluctuation or the true average of the new regime. Looking at the last 3 periods (P21-P23), the average demand is 50 units/week. Given the back-to-school season often lasts through August, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this latest phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since Period 23 left 16 units on-hand and demand has shown significant variance lately (31 to 65), I'll maintain a recent_N approach for sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine provides enough buffer for potential surges while not over-ordering if the 31-unit week is a sign of cooling.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend for Period 21-24 shows a fluctuating pattern (54, 65, 31, 22) as we move through July. While Periods 21-22 showed a rebound (average ~60), the last two periods (23-24) have dropped significantly (average 26.5), suggesting that the 'late-summer rebound' noted in the previous carry-over may have been a brief spike rather than a sustained shift. The product is 'Ladies Denim', which typically sees a 'Back to School' peak in August. Given the current date is July 29, we are entering the prime window for this seasonal uplift. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current volatility but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to stay responsive. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand rebound (P21-22) was followed by a sharp drop in late July (P23-24 avg: 26.5), indicating high volatility before the expected August Back-to-School season.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Historical data shows extreme volatility in July (weekly demand: 54, 65, 31, 22, 55). We are now entering August, which is a critical month for 'Back-to-School' shopping in the retail fashion sector, particularly for 'Ladies Denim' (trousers). Based on the product profile (extra skinny, high waist denim), we expect a significant seasonal uptick similar to the spring peak (approx. 100-110 units/week). Period 25 demand jumped back to 55 units, supporting the start of this trend. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent upward trajectory while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is currently 0, so the OR backend needs to place a substantial order to meet immediate and upcoming seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: August Back-to-School season start: Period 25 shows demand rising to 55 units (from late-July lows of ~26) confirming the start of the late-summer denim trend.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842001' (Ladies Denim) is entering the mid-August back-to-school season. Recent demand confirms a recovery from July lows: Period 25 (55 units) and Period 26 (52 units) show a significant increase compared to the late July average of ~26.5. This aligns with seasonal expectations for jeans as students and shoppers prepare for autumn. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this stabilization at a higher level, I am using a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which focuses on the recent demand uptick (P24-P26: 22, 55, 52) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to prevent stockouts while reflecting the higher volatility seen in this transition phase.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019, which is a peak period for Back-to-School (BTS) shopping, particularly for denim. Demand has shown a sharp upward trajectory over the last three weeks: 55 units (P25), 52 units (P26), and 97 units (P27), averaging ~68 units. This confirms the seasonal trend identified in the carry-over insights. Recent historical data from late January (Period 1-2) shows demand for this SKU can spike as high as 150-200 units. To capture the current momentum while balancing the risk of holding costs (which are equal to profit margins), I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the new BTS regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility during this period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand surge confirmed: Periods 25-27 show a rapid increase from ~26 units to an average of ~68 units/week, with the most recent peak reaching 97 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842001' (Ladies Denim) is in the middle of a sustained Back-to-School demand surge. Period 28 demand was 71 units, continuing the elevated trend from Period 27 (97 units). The average demand over the last four periods (P25-P28) is 68.75 units, significantly higher than the late-July lows (~26 units). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. However, for the last four periods (P25-P28), demand has consistently exceeded starting on-hand inventory, resulting in stockouts and lost sales. To stop this cycle and capture full demand in this peak season, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current 68.75/week mean, and using an explicit sigma_hat of 20 to provide a higher safety buffer than the current volatile period would naturally suggest, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to meet peak demand.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand regime (August) is producing consistent stockouts; mean demand is ~69 units/week (P25-P28), warranting higher safety stocks to prevent further lost sales during this peak.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September, which traditionally maintains higher demand for trousers due to back-to-school and early autumn shopping patterns. Recent demand in August (Periods 25-29) has averaged 66.4 units, significantly higher than the July average of ~43 units. While Period 29 showed a slight dip to 57 units, we have consistently stocked out (Periods 25-28), indicating the actual demand likely exceeds the units sold. The current on-hand inventory is 12 units. To prevent stockouts during this peak season, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 75 (slightly higher than the August mean to account for lost sales and seasonal strength) and maintaining a conservative sigma_hat based on recent high volatility (stdev of demand P25-P29 is ~19). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (Autumn start): Projected mean demand adjusted to ~75 units to account for stockout-suppressed demand in August. Actual lead time remains 0.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the early September Autumn season. Historically (February/March), demand for this denim product was higher (mean ~125), while the recent August Back-to-School (BTS) period showed demand ranging from 55 to 97 units. Period 30 data (demand=61) indicates a slight cooldown from the BTS peak of 97 in Period 27, but demand remains significantly higher than the late-July lows. As we transition deeper into September, I expect demand to stabilize around the 70-75 unit mark, reflecting sustained interest in trousers during the transition to cooler weather. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and avoid the stockouts seen in August, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 75 (1+L where L=0) and providing a conservative sigma_hat to buffer against the high volatility observed in recently concluded periods (e.g., jump from 57 to 97 in August).

Carry-over insight: September demand (Autumn transition) stabilizing: evidence from Period 29-30 (avg 59) suggests a minor step down from the August BTS peak (avg 69 for P25-28) but significantly higher than July lows.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in the post-Back-to-School autumn transition. Demand over the last three periods (P29-P31) has stabilized at an average of 58 units (57, 61, 56), which is a slight reduction from the August peak (average ~69) but higher than the July lows. Actual lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this stable autumn regime while including the start of the stabilization in late August. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median of the demand distribution. Parameters will aim to cover demand for the current period as the order arrives immediately (L=0).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 732842001 (Ladies Denim) is in a post-Back-to-School transition into Autumn. Following the August peak (~69 units), demand has gradually decelerated throughout September: P29 (57), P30 (61), P31 (56), and P32 (46). The average over these last 4 weeks is 55 units. Given that the product is a staple item ('Embrace S.Skinny'), I expect demand to stabilize around this 50-60 range rather than continue dropping sharply. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this current September stabilization (average ~55) and use a recent_N of 4 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This approach balances the stockout risk seen in August with the lower volume observed in mid-September.

Carry-over insight: September demand stabilization: Following the August Back-to-School peak (avg 69), September demand (P29-P32) has stabilized at a lower average of ~55 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a transition period following the September stabilization. While Period 29-32 suggested a mean demand of approximately 55 units, Period 33 showed a sharp spike to 92 units (stockout), which may indicate the start of an autumn/winter demand peak for denim. Total lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high stockout frequency in the recent period and the transition into October, I am increasing the demand forecast slightly above the September average to capture potential seasonal growth. mu_hat will be set using the last 5 periods (Periods 29-33) to reflect the recent high volatility and the spike in demand, and sigma_hat will also use recent_N to allow the OR engine to buffer against this renewed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand uptick detected: Period 33 demand spiked to 92 units (stockout), significantly exceeding the September average of 55 units. This may indicate a seasonal shift towards denim as weather cools in October.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in an Autumn demand phase for ladies' denim. Specifically, Period 33 (Sept 23) showed a significant demand spike (92 units, stockout) followed by 57 units in Period 34. This suggests a shift away from the stable September average (~55 units) toward higher volatility or a new uptick as the weather cools (Autumn season). We have 6 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. To capture this recent volatility and the potential start of an October trend, I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I'll use N=5 to encompass the most recent shift (Periods 30-34), which averages ~62.4 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly slightly higher at 75 to account for the potential Autumn surge and stockout-suppressed historical signals, while using recent_N for sigma to maintain responsiveness to the high variance seen in the last 2 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand transition (October start): Recent demand shows increased volatility (P33: 92 units, P34: 57 units) compared to the stable September mean (~55 units). Expecting an upward trend as cooler weather increases denim sales.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter mid-October (Period 36), we are observing high volatility in the Autumn transition. Period 33 spiked to 92 (stockout), while Periods 34-35 dropped to 57 and 45 respectively. Historically, this SKU (Ladies' Denim) saw a major regime shift in early February (+300% growth) and similar volatility during seasonal shifts (Spring and Back-to-School). While the last two periods show a dip, the stockout at 92 only three weeks ago suggests that the potential demand ceiling is much higher than the current average. Given the 0-period lead time and 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level via the OR backend), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the September/October transition) to capture the current mean of ~58 units/week. This balances the risk between the recent low of 45 and the high spike of 92, ensuring we don't over-index on either extreme while staying responsive to shifting Autumn weather demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (Period 37). Historical data shows demand has fluctuated significantly since the August Back-to-School peak. Most recently, demand in Periods 34-36 (57, 45, 40) suggests a cooling trend after the isolated spike in Period 33 (92). However, given this is 'Ladies Denim', we must guard against a potential late-autumn/winter uptick. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P33-P36) is approximately 58.5 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 20 units and demand is likely stabilizing around 50-60 units, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 samples (N=4) to capture the current post-spike regime while maintaining a responsive sigma_hat to handle the observed volatility (e.g., the P33 spike).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: After a high-volatility window in late September/early October (P33 spike), demand in mid-October (P35-P36) has settled to an average of ~42.5 units, slightly below the September average of ~55.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28. We are in the mid-to-late Autumn season for this 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' denim product. After a volatile start to October (P33-34), demand has entered a more stabilized phase over the last three periods (P35: 45, P36: 40, P37: 50), averaging 45 units/week. This is slightly lower than the September average of ~55 but higher than the mid-summer lows. Actual lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. To set parameters for Period 38, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this latest stabilized autumn regime (P35-P37). L remains at default (0) as there are no delivery delays. This configuration ensures we maintain enough stock for current sales without over-accumulating inventory as the season progresses.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Historically, demand for this 'Super Skinny High Waist Denim' SKU stabilized during the mid-autumn period (Periods 35-38), with an average demand of approximately 45.25 units per week (45, 40, 50, 46). Previous carry-over insights correctly identified a stabilization around ~43 units in mid-October. However, we are now entering November, heading towards the holiday season and colder weather, which typically drives a second peak for staple denim products. I've observed that lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 38 due to a slight stockout (demand 46 vs starting inventory 45). To prepare for potential November growth while maintaining the current baseline, I will use a conservative recent window (N=4) to capture the current stable regime but allow for the OR backend's service level logic to cover the recent volatility. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the 45.25 mean, and sigma_hat also uses N=4 to reflect the tightening variance in this stable period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' ladies' denim product shows a stabilization following the autumn transition. Recent demand (Periods 35-39) has been 45, 40, 50, 46, and 41 units, averaging 44.4 units per week. This indicates a consistent late-autumn regime. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since the inventory is currently low (5 units on-hand), and demand has been very stable around 44-46 units, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this stability. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect current volatility and ensure safety stock is representative of the most recent stable period, preventing stockouts without incurring unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand stabilization (Nov 2019): Demand has settled into a stable regime averaging ~44 units/week over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) with low variance.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for 'Ladies Denim Trousers' has been extremely stable throughout late October and early November. Over the last six periods (P35-P40), demand has averaged 42.6 units with relatively low volatility. The most recent period (P40) showed a slight dip to 34 units. Period 41 is approaching Black Friday/Cyber Monday territory (late November), which typically triggers a significant spike in apparel and denim demand. Based on the 2018 historical data provided (where demand jumped from near-zero to over 200 units in early 2019), it is prudent to prepare for a late-November uptick while maintaining the stable baseline. I will set L=0 (matching historical performance), mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current stable regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. This provides a balance between the current low-demand reality and the likely upcoming holiday surge.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a stable late-autumn demand regime. For the past 6 periods (P36-P41), demand has averaged 40 units (40, 50, 46, 41, 34, 29). While there is a slight downward trend in the last two weeks, the overall mean remains consistent with the late-autumn stabilization noted in earlier insights. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable late-autumn baseline (P35-P41) while allowing the OR engine to respond to the minor recent softening. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning base_stock should track the median demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019. Period 42 saw a significant demand spike to 63 units, which resulted in a stockout. This follows a period of stable demand (P35-P41) averaging ~41 units. Historically, the '732842001' SKU (Embrace Skinny Jeans) has demonstrated seasonal peaks: early Spring (March), Spring peak (May), and Back-to-School (August). We are now entering the December holiday season. Given the recent spike in P42 (up from P41's 29), I anticipate a December seasonal uptick. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this upward shift while tempering the P42 spike. For sigma_hat, I will use a larger window (N=8) to capture the broader volatility of the transition from the stable November period into the more volatile December period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand uptick detected: Period 42 demand jumped to 63 units from a stable November average (P35-P41) of ~41 units, resulting in a stockout.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9, 2019), entering the peak holiday shopping season. Last period (P43) saw a dip in demand (18 units) following a stockout in P42 (63 demand). This volatility is characteristic of the transition into December. Looking back at P42, the surge suggests that holiday demand is significantly higher than the stable November average of ~41 units. To capture the expected upturn in late December and ensure high service levels during this high-profit window, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3. This specifically weights the late-November uptick (63) and early-December activity, smoothing out the immediate P43 dip while remaining higher than the autumn baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'conclude' messages. On-hand is currently 24 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45, Dec 16). Historical carry-over indicates a holiday demand uptick started in early December (P42 demand: 63). However, P43 and P44 saw lower demand (18 and 33 units), potentially due to timing or inventory constraints. Given the proximity to Christmas and the 'Ladies Denim' category, I expect demand to spike significantly in the current and next period before the post-holiday lull. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To capture the holiday peak and prevent stockouts seen in P42, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 75 units (exceeding the recent average to account for the peak week) and increase sigma_hat to 25 to account for seasonal volatility. L remains at the promised/actual 0.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Christmas week (2019/12/23). Historical demand for this 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans SKU showed a pre-holiday jump in Period 42 (63 units) followed by a dip and then a recovery to 51 units in Period 45. In Period 1 (similarly post-peak), demand was 167. Given the SKU's high-stretch, flattering 'Embrace' features, it is likely a popular gift or party-wear item. While Period 43 demand was low (18), the most recent sample (51) and the approach of New Year's Eve suggest sustained interest. Demand mean for the last 4 periods is ~41.25. However, since the current inventory is only 24 units and we are in a peak seasonal window, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current volatility while ensuring mu_hat reflects the potential for holiday-related spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: Periods 42-45 show fluctuates between 18 and 63 units, averaging 41.25, suggesting a non-stable regime during the December festive season.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the final week of December (Period 47, Dec 30). Historical demand for this 'Embrace' super-skinny jean shows significant seasonality. The most recent 'holiday' regime (Periods 42-46) has shown high volatility with demand ranging from 18 to 63, averaging ~42 units per week, including two stockouts in five weeks. As we transition into January 2019 (referencing the initial data provided in the prompt), the demand for this SKU showed a massive growth spurt starting the week of Jan 21 (36 units) and exploding in February (reaching 215 units by Feb 4). To capture this 'New Year/Early Spring' growth trend which historically begins in 2-3 weeks, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the holiday average of ~42) but maintaining a high sigma_hat via recent_N=10 to ensure the base stock is high enough to buffer against the expected rapid climb in demand and the stockouts observed in the last two months. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Transitioning to January New Year regime: Expecting repeat of 2019 early-year growth where demand surged from ~30 to >200 units within 4 weeks (evidence: Jan-Feb 2019 samples).
