Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is 'Women's Everyday Basics Jersey Basic Short Shorts', which typically sees increasing demand as spring/summer approaches. The historical samples show 5 weeks of data (45, 52, 45, 54, 47) with a mean of 48.6 and a standard deviation of 4.1. Since there is no on-hand inventory and the promised lead time is 0, we need to order immediately to satisfy current and upcoming demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent baseline, while setting L to 'default' (0). The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand and safety stock.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Short shorts in sweatshirt fabric', a basic garment. Historically, demand over the last 5 samples (Jan-Feb) was [45, 52, 45, 54, 47], resulting in a mean of 48.6. In Period 1, actual demand was 49, which aligns perfectly with this mean. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time was 0), confirming the 0-period lead time for now. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). Using the 'default' methods will calculate the mean and standard deviation from all available data (the 5 historical samples + Period 1's actual demand), which provides a stable baseline for this 'Everyday Basic' item as we enter late February.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we saw a demand surge (67 units) compared to the initial historical mean of ~48 units, resulting in a stockout of 18 units. This increase coincides with the approach of spring, which aligns with 'Women's Everyday Basics' sweatshirt shorts. Since the promised lead time (L=0) is functioning reliably (concluded arrivals in P1 and P2), I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use the last 3 samples (54, 47 from pre-game, and 67 from P2) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which yields a mean of 56. Given L=0, the OR backend will set mu_hat to (1+0)*56. This adjustment aims to capture the upward trend and provide a higher service level to prevent further stockouts while holding costs are equal to profit per unit.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Shorts', a seasonal spring/summer item. The current date is March 4th. Historical demand has shown a clear upward trend (45, 52, 45, 54, 47 from pre-game samples, followed by 49, 67, 76 in-game). We have experienced stockouts for three consecutive periods because demand is outstripping the current base stock calculations. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To address the stockouts and the seasonal upturn, I am increasing mu_hat using 'explicit' to account for both the recent average (approx 64) and the growth trend, aiming for a value that captures the high end of recent demand (76+). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the increased volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: 396135007 transitioned from stable (~48) to growth phase starting Feb 18 (P2: 67, P3: 76), likely due to seasonal spring preparation. Lead time confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jersey Basic Short shorts', a seasonal spring/summer item. The current date is March 11, entering the peak spring shopping season. Historically, demand was stable around 48, but has jumped significantly in the last three periods (P2: 67, P3: 76, P4: 75). This confirms a new demand regime associated with seasonal warming. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), allowing for highly responsive ordering. I will use the last 3 samples (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand level (~73 units/period) while ignoring the lower winter baseline. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current review period (1+L=1).

Carry-over insight: Demand shift to spring regime confirmed (P2-P4 average ~73 vs P1/Pre-history average ~48). Seasonal growth for shorts is sustained as of March.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jersey Basic shorts', which is heavily seasonal as we move into spring (March). Historical data shows a clear regime shift from an average demand of ~48 in January/early February to an average of ~73 over the last four periods (67, 76, 75, 73). Period 5 saw demand of 73, which was fully met by the 73 units available (10 carry-over + 63 ordered). Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods across all 5 periods. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this new spring demand regime while excluding the lower winter baseline. Given the 1:1 Profit to Holding Cost ratio, the OR backend's service level target (critical ratio) is 0.5, meaning it will aim for the median demand. By focusing on the last 4 periods, we provide a mu_hat reflective of current velocity to prevent stockouts during this seasonal climb.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Basic Short shorts', which is heavily seasonal as we move into Spring (March 25). Historical demand has clearly shifted from a pre-history/P1 mean of ~48 to a higher regime. Recent demand (P3-P6) has been 76, 75, 73, 87, showing an upward trend and higher volatility. Notably, in P2, P3, and P6, we stocked out (ending inventory 0), indicating that 'demand' recorded reflects lost sales potential. In P6, demand reached 87 while we only had 73 units. To capture this growth and avoid stockouts during this seasonal ramp-up, I will use recent_N (N=4) to project demand, but I will explicitly set a higher mu_hat to account for the clear upward trajectory and the fact that 87 was likely suppressed by stock limits. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Setting L=0, mu_hat=85 (reflecting the most recent high), and standard deviation derived from the recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed in growth phase for Spring; P6 demand (87) indicates the spring peak is intensifying. Stockouts in 3 of the last 5 periods suggest the OR backend's default 'cap' or previous parameters were too conservative for this seasonal surge.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Jersey Shorts) is experiencing a strong seasonal upward trend as we enter April. Demand has risen from ~48 in early February to 109 in the most recent period (Period 7). The system has stocked out in 6 out of 7 periods, indicating that parameters have consistently lagged behind the actual growth. In Period 7, demand jumped to 109, yet only 85 units were available. To prevent further lost sales during the high-demand spring season, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 125. This allows for sustained growth from the recent 109. I am also increasing sigma_hat to 20 to account for higher volatility during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on all previous arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in late March (Period 7: 109 units, +25% from Period 6). Seasonal peak for 'Shorts' is now fully active.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Women's Everyday Basics Jersey Shorts' is in a strong seasonal spring upswing. Current date April 8th is prime season. History shows demand has grown from ~48 in early February to 109 in late March and 125 in the first week of April. Stockouts have occurred in 7 out of 8 periods because demand consistently exceeds supply (inventory is zeroed out every period except P4). In Period 8, we ordered 125 units and all were sold instantly, suggesting true demand likely exceeds the 125 recorded sales. To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I am transitioning to an 'explicit' forecast. Based on the 109 to 125 jump (+15%), I estimate true Period 9 demand at 145 units. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning mu_hat (1+L) should be set to 145. I will increase sigma_hat explicitly to provide a larger buffer, as the OR backend's cap is currently too restrictive for this acceleration.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth for Womens Shorts is accelerating through April: demand increased from 109 (P7) to 125 (P8), a 15% WoW increase. Consistent stockouts indicate the historical average-based backend cap is lagging actual seasonal demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Shorts) is in its peak spring/early summer season. Although Period 9 saw a dip in demand (87) compared to the Period 8 peak (125), this follows a period of heavy stockouts where demand was suppressed by available supply. Historically, April demand for 'Shorts' is volatile but trending upward as temperatures rise. The ending inventory of 58 suggests we are finally catching up with the seasonal surge. I will maintain a high mu_hat to account for seasonal volatility and prevent further stockouts, as the OR backend's cap is derived from recent stats. I will use the average of the last 3 periods (P7-P9) which covers the peak growth phase (Avg = (109+125+87)/3 = 107) to set mu_hat. Since lead time is confirmed at 0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*demand. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high volatility seen during this growth regime (87 to 125 range).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in peak season: Period 9 demand (87) shows a pullback from Period 8 peak (125), but remains significantly higher than early Spring averages (~73). Seasonal peak is sustained but highly variable.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Jersey Shorts) is in its high-season peak in late April. Demand reached a new high of 137 in Period 10, following a sequence of 109, 125, 87, and 137. The previous dip to 87 in Period 9 appears to have been a temporary fluctuation rather than a trend reversal, as demand surged back to 137. Stockouts occurred in Period 10 (sold 107 of 137 demanded) and have been frequent throughout the spring, indicating the OR motor's internal cap is still too restrictive. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this peak demand regime (averaging ~115). I will also set sigma_hat to 'explicit' using the standard deviation of these peak periods (~22) to ensure the safety stock is sufficient to handle the high volatility observed in April. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a seasonal peak of 137 in Period 10 (April 15). The average demand for the last 4 periods (P7-P10) is 114.5 units, which is 57% higher than the early spring average (~73), confirming peak season intensity.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Sweatshirt Shorts) is currently in its peak seasonal demand phase (late April). Demand has significantly increased, hitting a record high of 152 in Period 11, despite a previous pullback to 87 in Period 9 and 137 in Period 10. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is approximately 125 units, which is a significant increase over the early spring average. We have experienced stockouts in 10 out of 11 periods because the order quantity (driven by the OR backend cap) is consistently lower than the realized demand. Since lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, we need to set mu_hat to cover the immediate demand. Using a recent_N of 4 periods captures this peak intensity (avg 125.25), and I am using explicit mu_hat to ensure the backend cap (which is usually mu_hat * 1.5-2.0) is high enough to allow an order that satisfies this 150+ unit potential. I set mu_hat to 150 to bridge the gap between historical averages and the current peak demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand peaked at 152 in Period 11 (late April). The peak season for shorts is currently at its maximum intensity, with demand outstripping supply in 10/11 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 396135007 (Womens Shorts) is currently in its peak seasonal phase (May 6). Over the last five periods (P8-P12), demand has been 125, 87, 137, 152, and 133, yielding an average of approximately 127 units. In P12, demand was 133, and we ended with 17 units on hand. The promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently observed. To ensure we capture the remaining seasonal peak while accounting for the high volatility (ranging from 87 to 152 in the last 5 weeks), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect this high-demand plateau. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat as well to capture the increased variance observed during this peak. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that minimizes lost sales during this high-profit window without excessive overordering as we move further into May.

Carry-over insight: Peak season plateau confirmed for May: Average demand (P8-P12) is ~127 units. Demand remains highly volatile (Std Dev ~24 during this period).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Shorts) is currently in its peak seasonal window (May). Period 13 saw a significant drop in demand to 78 units, compared to the recent peak plateau of ~127 units (P8-P12). This volatility is consistent with spring/summer weather shifts. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Since Period 13 demand (78) is much lower than the previous period's average, I will use a recent window (N=6) to calculate mu_hat, which captures the high-demand peaks (109, 125, 87, 137, 152, 133) while allowing the most recent dip to influence the variance. However, given the product type (shorts) and date (mid-May), we are still in prime selling season. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to maintain a robust base stock that can handle seasonal spikes, while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the recent high volatility. This protects against stockouts which have been frequent (10 out of the last 13 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in May: Period 13 demand (78) dropped significantly from the Period 8-12 average (~127), though it remains above early spring levels (~73).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. This SKU (Women's Shorts) is transitioning from its peak April/early May season into a late spring plateau. Recent demand in Period 13 (78) and Period 14 (77) indicates a significant drop from the peak (P8-P12 average of ~127), suggesting the peak intensity is subsiding. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs as demand cools, I am shifting from recent_N (which was tracking the peak) to an EWMA_gamma method for mu_hat. This choice allows the forecast to respond quickly to the recent lower demand levels while still acknowledging the historical average. I've set gamma to 0.5 to balance recent observations with the slightly higher preceding periods. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen during the peak-to-plateau transition, ensuring a sufficient service level buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Post-peak plateau confirmed. Demand dropped from ~127 (P8-P12) to ~77 (P13-P14), a 39% decrease as the initial spring surge concludes.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 396135007 (Womens Everyday Basics Shorts) has clearly entered a post-peak seasonal decline as of late May (Period 13 onwards). Demand transitioned from a high-season average of ~127 units (P8-P12) to a much lower level. Specifically, the last three periods (P13, P14, P15) recorded demand of 78, 77, and 53 respectively. The latest observation of 53 units (Period 15) suggests the downward trend is continuing, returning toward early-spring levels (~48-50) rather than stabilizing at the previous plateau of ~77. Given the current on-hand inventory of 39 units and a lead time of 0, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this cooling demand to avoid excess holding costs (Holding Cost = Profit = $1). I am choosing an explicit value of 55 for mu_hat, slightly above the most recent demand (53) to maintain a safety buffer while acknowledging the decline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the volatility of this new downward regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-peak seasonal decline accelerated in Period 15 (demand 53), returning toward pre-spring levels (~50) after a May plateau of ~77.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 396135007 (Womens Everyday Basics Shorts) has entered a post-peak stabilization phase as of June. After reaching a seasonal high of 152 (P11), demand has cooled significantly. However, Period 16 showed a surprising rally to 89 units despite the previous decline toward the mid-50s. This suggests that while the initial spring 'surge' is over, summer demand is stabilizing at a higher floor (~70-80 units) rather than reverting all the way to pre-history levels (~48). On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to an underflow in Period 16. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current plateau (averaging ~74 over P13-P16) while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat, explicit=25) seen in recent periods. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in early June: After a post-peak drop, the demand regime appears to be settling into a summer floor of approximately 75 units (Avg P13-P16 = 74.25), significantly higher than the February baseline of 48.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, mid-summer. Recent demand for 'Womens Shorts' has stabilized after the post-peak drop. Period 16 demand was 89 and Period 17 demand was 88, confirming the 'summer floor' identified in the Period 17 insight. This floor (Avg P16-P17 = 88.5) is higher than the previously estimated 75 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The SKU has stocked out in the last two periods (P16, P17), indicating that recent ordering parameters have been too lean to capture the full summer demand. I will use recent_N=3 (Periods 15-17) to set mu_hat, which captures the shift from the spring decline into the summer plateau (~77 units average). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility (53, 89, 88) seen during this transition. This approach aims to provide enough stock to meet the sustained summer demand while acknowledging the volatility observed as heatwaves or early summer shopping patterns fluctuate.

Carry-over insight: Summer floor updated: Demand in June (P16-P17) has leveled at ~88 units, which is higher than the early June projection of 75. This suggests a sustained summer demand regime stronger than the initial post-peak decline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '396135007' (Womens Shorts) is currently in a 'summer floor' demand regime following the spring peak and subsequent decline. In June, demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 79 units (Avg P16: 89, P17: 88, P18: 60), which is a 65% increase over the initial pre-spring baseline of ~48 units. Period 18 saw a slight dip to 60 units, but it remains within the expected summer distribution. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since the profit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level is q = 0.5 (Safety stock Z \u2248 0). To accurately reflect the current summer stability and avoid over-ordering from the outdated spring peak samples, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent three periods of June demand and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility observed in the transition from P17 (88) to P18 (60).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Shorts) is experiencing high volatility during the summer season. Period 19 demand spiked to 135 units, following a quieter Period 18 (60 units). This indicates that the 'summer floor' is not a flat line but subject to significant spikes, likely driven by weather or promotions. The average demand over the last four periods (P16-P19: 89, 88, 60, 135) is 93 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat to 95 units to capture this summer average while providing some buffer for the recent spike. I am using recent_N (N=4) to focus on the June demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to explicit (30) to account for the high volatility observed (the swing from 60 to 135). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, so the OR backend will calculate the order based on this base stock minus zero pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand volatility confirmed: June demand (P16-P19) shows an average of 93 units but with high variance (range 60-135), exceeding the previous 'summer floor' estimate of 75-88.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '396135007' (Womens Jersey Shorts) is experiencing a sudden and significant demand surge in late June/early July. Demand in Period 19 (135) and Period 20 (163) represents the highest levels seen in the entire history, outstripping the previous spring peak (~152). This is likely driven by peak summer temperatures and holiday preparation (July 4th) in the US market. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the previous order of 93 units was entirely sold out (and under-supplied). Given this acute acceleration, I am shifting from the 'summer floor' estimate (avg ~93) to a 'peak summer' regime. I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture this immediate surge while acknowledging the extreme volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Peak summer surge confirmed (Period 19-20 demand avg 149 units, +60% over previous June average of 93). Demand reached a series high of 163 units in late June.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Shorts) is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Though demand dropped from the series high of 163 (P20) to 85 (P21), the recent average (P19-P21) is 127.7 units, which is significantly higher than the early June baseline. The drop in P21 is likely volatility within a high-demand period rather than a regime shift, as July is typically peak season for shorts. With the profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5. To capture the current summer surge while acknowledging the recent volatility, I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat to weight the current high-demand cluster (135, 163, 85). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Shorts', a highly seasonal item currently in mid-July. We have observed two distinct peaks: a spring peak (late April, Period 11 demand 152) and a summer surge (late June, Period 20 demand 163). Demand in the last two periods (P21: 85, P22: 51) indicates a significant post-peak summer decline, typical as mid-summer clearances begin and consumer focus shifts away from warm-weather basics. The 'Summer Floor' established in June (avg ~93) is no longer holding, with P22 demand hitting 51, closer to pre-spring levels (~48). Inventory is currently high (77 units on hand), which is more than enough to cover the recent demand of 51 units. I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this rapid late-season cooling while preventing excessive overstocking as we move towards August. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Late summer decline confirmed. Demand dropped from the summer surge average (P19-P20: 149) to post-surge cooling (P21-P22: 68), returning toward pre-season baselines.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Jersey Shorts) has exited its peak summer surge (Period 19-20) and entered a late-summer cooling phase. Demand in the most recent three periods (P21-P23) has been 85, 51, and 69, respectively (avg ~68.3), which is a significant drop from the surge average (~149). This cooling trend is expected given the late July date. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this post-surge level. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 31 units, and the OR backend's service level logic (profit=1, holding cost=1 implies a 50% target service level) will adjust the order to prevent excessive holding costs during this seasonal decline toward pre-season baselines.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Shorts' is exhibiting high mid-summer volatility. After the late July decline (P21-P22 avg: 68), Period 24 saw a sudden spike to 136 units, potentially driven by a heatwave or end-of-July summer clearance interest. This follows the pattern observed in June (P19-P20) where demand surged before retreating. Given the target is 'Womens Everyday Basics', demand remains reactive to weather and summer activities despite being past the initial spring launch peak. Lead time remains stable at 0. Due to back-to-back regime shifts and high variance (P22: 51, P23: 69, P24: 136), I will use recent_N=4 (P21-P24) to calculate mu_hat, capturing the higher average demand of ~85 units from this volatile late-summer period while providing a buffer against stockouts seen in Period 24.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer volatility confirmed: Late July (P24) showed a secondary demand surge (136 units) despite the previous cooling trend, suggesting demand for shorts remains highly sensitive to external factors through July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of August 5th (Period 26), the product (Womens Shorts) is exiting the core summer season and entering the late-summer/pre-autumn transition. July was characterized by extreme volatility: a cooling period (P22-P23 avg: 60) followed by a significant secondary surge in late July (P24-P25 avg: 121). While recent demand is high, historical patterns for seasonal garments suggest a decline in August. To balance the risk of stockouts from the recent surge against high holding costs during the seasonal wind-down, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P21-P25) which averages 89.6 units. This captures the full volatility of the July cycle. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the high variance (Std Dev ~36) observed during this period, ensuring the inventory level is robust against further surges while acknowledging the transition phase. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Secondary summer demand surge confirmed in late July: Demand rose from an average of 60 (P22-P23) to 121 (P24-P25), an increase of ~100%, indicating significant late-season volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Shorts) is moving into mid-to-late August, which typically signals the tapering of summer demand as shoppers transition to back-to-school or early autumn categories. Recent performance shows high volatility: the late July 'secondary surge' (P24: 136, P25: 107) has begun to cool, with Period 26 demand at 73. This follows a pattern of high mid-summer variance where demand oscillates between ~60 and ~140. Given the date (Aug 12), I expect demand to continue its gradual decline towards pre-season levels, but with enough residual volatility to warrant protecting against stockouts, which have been frequent. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average demand ~97) to capture the cooling trend from the late July peak while acknowledging the sustained floor. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Shorts) is entering late August (Period 28). Historical demand shows a significant secondary summer surge in July (P24-P25 avg: 121), followed by a cooling trend in August (P26-P27 avg: 68). This pattern suggests that as we move deeper into August, demand is reverting toward the post-peak floor observed earlier in June/July (approx 75 units). With current on-hand inventory at 25 units and recent demand showing a consecutive decline (107 -> 73 -> 63), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (avg approx 81) to balance for the cooling demand while maintaining a buffer against mid-August volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent '0 periods' status in the game history through P27. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the high historical volatility (range 51-163) and ensure sufficient service level during regime transitions.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand cooling confirmed: Demand decreased from a July peak (P24-P25 avg 121) to an August cooling phase (P26-P27 avg 68), a 44% reduction, signaling the approach of the seasonal end for shorts.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019 (Period 29). This is the late summer season for 'Shorts', and historical patterns (Periods 26-28) confirm a Cooling Phase as demand has steadily declined from the July peak. Demand over the last three periods has been 73, 63, and 51, indicating a clear downward trend towards pre-season levels (~48). The Lead Time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory as the season ends, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to track the current cooling trend closely, which averages to 62.33. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent window (N=3) to capture current volatility while avoiding the extreme spikes seen in July. This approach ensures we maintain a leaner inventory (30 units currently on hand) and do not over-order as demand for sweatshirt shorts naturally tapers off in late August.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Shorts) is entering September, marking the end of the peak summer season. Historical data shows a clear cooling trend: Period 26-29 demand has averaged 61.5 units (73, 63, 51, 59), compared to the July peak which saw surges up to 136. The current demand regime is characterized by a gradual decline as fall approaches. Stock levels are currently lean (4 on-hand), but since lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, we can remain responsive. I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this August/late-summer cooling phase (avg ~62). Sigma_hat is set to the same period to account for the tightening variance as the season ends. This should prevent overstocking as the product moves into its clearance or low-season phase.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal transition: Demand for shorts has stabilized into a late-summer cooling phase (Avg P26-P29: ~62 units), down from July peaks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9th, and history shows a clear transition into the end-of-season cooling phase for shorts. Demand in the most recent periods (P28-P30) has been 51, 59, and 41, creating a late-season average of 50.3 units. This is a significant drop from the mid-summer average of ~93 and July peaks. On-hand inventory is 21 units. Since the lead time remains solidly at 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this cooling trend (N=4, covering P27-P30, average ~53.5) to avoid over-ordering as fall approaches. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the same N=4 to reflect the decreased volatility observed in the cooling phase compared to the high-variance summer peaks. This approach balances the service level for the remaining summer demand while minimizing the risk of holding obsolete end-of-season inventory.

Carry-over insight: Late-season cooling regime confirmed: September demand (P28-P30) averaged 50.3 units, a ~20% decrease from the initial August cooling average of ~62. Demand is returning to February/Pre-history baselines (~48).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Shorts' is entering a clear late-season decline as we move into mid-September. Period 31 demand (11 units) was significantly lower than the previous cooling average (P28-P30 average of ~50.3). While some of this may be intra-week volatility, the downward trend is consistent with the product's seasonality. On-hand inventory is 43 units, which already covers roughly 4 periods based on the most recent demand observation. To avoid excessive holding costs on a sunsetting product, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 3-period average (P29-P31: approx 37 units/period) and keeping sigma_hat responsive to the recent volatility (N=5). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-season decline accelerated in mid-September: Period 31 demand (11 units) is 78% lower than the late-August/early-September average (~50), signaling the end of the shorts season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Womens Shorts) is entering its end-of-season terminal phase in late September. Period 31 and 32 demand (11 and 14 units respectively) confirm a sharp drop from the early September average of ~50 units. With on-hand inventory at 29 units and demand settling at a low floor, there is a significant risk of overstocking and incurring holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture this rapid decline while allowing the OR backend to minimize orders. This approach ensures we deplete existing inventory before the season concludes entirely.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season terminal phase confirmed for late September: Demand dropped from a late-August average of ~62 to a mid-September average of 12.5 (P31-P32), a persistent ~80% reduction.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Shorts', which is currently in its terminal end-of-season phase as of late September (Period 34). Recent demand (P31-P33) has plummeted to an average of ~16 units (11, 14, 24), a drastic reduction from the late-summer cooling phase (~60). We are at the end of the game (P34/47) and the end of the seasonal demand cycle for this SKU. There is currently an on-hand inventory of 5 units. Given the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), the risk of overstocking significantly outweighs the benefit of meeting every unit of the now-minimal demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current terminal demand levels (mean 16.3), which will result in a very small order to satisfy what little demand remains while minimizing end-of-season liquidation/holding costs.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Shorts', which is now firmly in its end-season terminal phase as of October 7th. Historically, demand dropped significantly in mid-September (Period 31-32) from a 50+ unit average to ~12.5 units. Most recently, Period 34 demand was 26, which is a slight uptick compared to the previous two periods (11, 14, 24) but still reflects low end-of-season interest. There is no on-hand inventory. Given that the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), the risk of overstocking outweighs the benefit of capturing marginal sales in a declining season. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the terminal demand level (Avg P31-P34: ~18.75 units). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Womens Shorts) is in its terminal end-of-season phase as of mid-October. Since Period 31, demand has collapsed from historical peaks (~150) to a very low late-season range. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P31-P35) have seen demands of 11, 14, 24, 26, 26. While there was a slight uptick in the last two weeks compared to mid-September, the overall volume is less than half of the February baseline (~48), confirming we are clearing out. Current on-hand is 0. With lead time stable at 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this current low-demand plateau using the last 5 periods (mean ~20) to ensure we don't over-order during the final weeks of the simulation. This minimizes holding cost risk while capturing the small remaining sales volume. sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to handle the recent variance.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season terminal floor confirmed: October demand (P34-P35) stabilized at ~26 units, significantly lower than peak season but higher than the mid-September low of 12.5.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Jersey Shorts) is in its end-of-season terminal phase during late October. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the summer peak. For the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has been incredibly consistent: 26, 26, and 21 (average = 24.3). This confirms the terminal floor identified in P36. The current lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the optimal service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should closely follow the mean demand. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this late-season stability (P34-P36) and avoid over-ordering as the season ends. Setting mu_hat to approximately 24 and sigma_hat based on the recent low volatility will minimize holding costs while meeting the remaining baseline demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Shorts) is in its terminal end-of-season phase as of late October (Period 38). Historical data reveals a clear seasonal arc: a spring ramp-up in February, a mid-summer peak in June/July, and a steady decline beginning in August. Since Period 34 (late September), demand has stabilized at a low floor, averaging approximately 22.4 units per period (P34-P37: 26, 26, 21, 15). The most recent demand of 15 units in Period 37 confirms that the 'terminal floor' identified in Period 36 (~26 units) is potentially drifting even lower as colder weather approaches. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess ending inventory at the very end of the game (which incurs a holding cost equal to the profit margin), I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this low October floor (avg ~22), but I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 5 to minimize the logic's tendency to over-order safety stock for a declining seasonal item, ensuring we prioritize clearing remaining inventory (on-hand is 10).

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor updated: late October demand (P37) dropped to 15, indicating the terminal floor for shorts is now sliding below the 20-25 unit range observed earlier in the month.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Shorts', an item with distinct seasonality. As of Period 39 (November 4), we are in the terminal end-of-season phase. Historical demand shows a clear cooling trend from September (~50 units) through October (~15-20 units). The last four weeks (P35-P38) show demand of 26, 21, 15, and 14, indicating a stabilization at a low floor. Given the 1:1 profit to holding cost ratio, the backend targeting a 50% service level is appropriate to avoid excess inventory costs as the season concludes. Setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) captures this terminal floor (avg ~19) without being overly influenced by the higher early-October or late-September numbers. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season stabilization: October/November demand for shorts has reached a terminal floor of approximately 14-20 units per period (Avg P37-P38 = 14.5).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Shorts', which is currently in its terminal late-autumn phase (November). Demand has significantly declined from summer peaks and has reached a low, stable terminal floor. The most recent demand (Period 39) was 9 units, following two periods of 14-15 units. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P37-P39) is 12.67 units. This represents a confirmed final seasonal cooling. With 10 units on-hand and a 0-period lead time, I will set mu_hat to match this terminal floor using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current low-demand stability. I will use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current low volatility in this end-of-season stage, while maintaining a 0-period lead appointment.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season terminal floor confirmed: November demand (P39) dropped to 9 units, suggesting the late-autumn baseline for shorts is settling between 9-13 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Shorts', which is currently in its end-of-season terminal phase (late November). Demand has stabilized at a low floor following the summer peaks. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P37-P40) is 13.5 units (15, 14, 9, 16). Period 40 demand was 16, which exhausted the limited on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a sufficient service level without overstocking during this low-demand phase, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current terminal floor (~13.5) and keep sigma_hat at the default to handle the minor variance observed in this stage.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has been 15, 14, 9, 16, 16, resulting in a mean of 14.0. The recent trend shows a slight uptick from the seasonal low of 9, stabilizing in the 14-16 range. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To minimize holding cost while avoiding stockouts during this low-volume floor, I am setting L=0 and using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent end-of-season behavior (late October/November), ensuring the base stock level reflects the current terminal regime of approx 14 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Shorts', a highly seasonal item entering the winter terminal phase (December 2). Historical demand has settled into a late-season floor. Recent demand (P40-P42) shows a slight uptick to 16, 16, and 27 units, likely due to small late-season clearance effects or early holiday shoppers, but remains significantly lower than the summer peak. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 16.4 units. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this minor year-end stabilization while maintaining a low inventory profile to avoid holding costs for an out-of-season item. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the current volatility (Std Dev ~7). Lead time L is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand floor for shorts has stabilized in the 15-25 unit range during November/early December; year-end volatility is higher than mid-autumn baseline.

In November and early December (Periods 39-43), the demand has averaged approximately 16 units per period. The recent volatility (P41: 16, P42: 27, P43: 14) suggests a slightly higher and more variable floor than the mid-November lows. The on-hand inventory is 3 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (P39-P43 average = 16.4) to capture this late-season baseline while allowing the OR backend to handle the current volatility via sigma_hat. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as it covers the most recent stable regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 396135007 (Women's Jersey Shorts) is in its terminal seasonal phase (December). Demand has significantly dropped, with Period 44 recorded at only 4 units. Period 43 demand was 14 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is 15.4 units, but the most recent data shows a steepening decline as we move further into winter. Lead time is consistently 0. With 13 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, existing inventory covers most of the expected demand for the upcoming period given the current downward trend. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the low late-season baseline, while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the recent variability in this range. The OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to maintain the safety stock for this floor level.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand for shorts reached a new seasonal low in December (Period 44: 4 units), suggesting the terminal floor may be lower than the previously estimated 15-25 units during the deepest winter weeks.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '396135007' (Womens Everyday Basics Shorts) is in the deepest part of the winter season (late December). Historical demand over the last 3 periods (P43-P45) has been low: 14, 4, and 6 units respectively, creating an average of 8 units per period. This aligns with the 'End-of-season terminal floor' identified in the carry-over insights. On-hand inventory is currently 10 units. With a lead time of 0 periods, the system arrives and settles within the same period. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low-demand winter baseline (covering roughly mid-November to present) while smoothing out the high volatility seen in early December. This will prevent excessive stock-building for an out-of-season item while maintaining a small buffer for the baseline demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, the deepest part of the winter season for 'Womens Shorts'. Demand has consistently remained at terminal lows, with the last four periods (P43-P46) averaging 8.25 units (14, 4, 6, 9). This aligns with the seasonal expectation that shorts have minimal demand in late December/early January. On-hand inventory is 5 units. Given that the promised and actual lead times are 0, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4-period regime to reflect this winter floor. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the low but non-zero volatility observed during this period. This approach ensures we maintain minimal stock to satisfy the current trickle of demand while avoiding unnecessary holding costs at the end of the year.
