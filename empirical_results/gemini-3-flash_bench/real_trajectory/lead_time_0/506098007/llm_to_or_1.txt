Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the SKU 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' (Womens Lingerie). Current inventory is 0. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 12, 11, 48, 82, and 59. Specifically, demand surged from ~11 units/week in early January to an average of 63 units/week in the most recent 3 weeks. This spike aligns with the lead-up to Valentine's Day (Feb 14th). Given today is Feb 11th, we are currently in the peak period. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime for bras/lingerie. The promised lead time is 0, and since we have no historical arrival data to suggest a drift, I will use the 'default' lead time (0). Using N=3 (avg ~63/week) instead of the total mean (~42/week) ensures the backup-stock calculation avoids a stockout during this localized peak.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a push-up bra (Womens Lingerie). Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: Jan 7 (12), Jan 14 (11), Jan 21 (48), Jan 28 (82), Feb 4 (59), and most recently Feb 11 (67). The average demand over the last four weeks is ~64 units. Given this is lingerie and we are in mid-February, we are likely seeing a Valentine's Day related peak or a new seasonal baseline. The promised lead time is 0, and the Period 1 order arrived immediately (lead_time 0). I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime, and N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility since late January. With L=0, the OR engine will target a base stock level of (1+0) * mean demand, adjusted by the service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting late January: mean demand increased from ~12 to ~64 (+430%) likely due to seasonality/product lifecycle.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear shift starting in late January: early January samples (Jan 7, Jan 14) averaged ~11.5, while recent samples (Jan 21, Jan 28, Feb 4, Feb 11, Feb 18) average 65.4 units. The product is a 2-pack push-up bra, which likely sees higher demand following the New Year/Valentine's period. Promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time for Period 1 and 2 was confirmed as 0. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime (65.4 units/period). With 6 units on hand and 0 in transit, the OR engine needs to order to cover the current period's demand (estimated ~65-70). Set L to default (0).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '506098007' (Womens Lingerie) has transitioned into a new demand regime as of late January/early February. Following the initial samples (12, 11, 48, 82, 59), observed demand in Periods 1-3 has been 67, 71, and 54 respectively. This confirms the previously identified shift to a higher mean (avg ~64). Date is March 4th; lingerie demand remains stable post-Valentine's but higher than the January baseline. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across P1-P3, matching the promised lead time. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on this new regime's mean and volatility while keeping L as default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-January demand stabilized around mean of 64 units (Periods 1-3), a significant increase from the initial average of 11.5 units.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is Women's Lingerie (Push-up bras), which shows a steady demand regime after a significant jump in late January. Historical demand samples provided (pre-period 1) showed a mean of ~11.5, but the active periods (1-4) show a stable, higher demand regime: 67, 71, 54, 68 (Avg: 65.0, Std Dev: 7.6). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (4 units). Since L=0, the target base stock must cover Period 5 demand. I will use N=4 to capture the current stable high-demand regime, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on these most recent four observations to maintain a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable: Periods 1-4 show mean demand of 65.0 units (\u03c3 \u2248 7.6), maintaining the 430% increase noted in January.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-03-18. We are managing a women's lingerie SKU. Historical data shows a clear demand shift that occurred in late January. Since the simulation started (Period 1), demand has consistently stabilized around a higher mean. Analyzing the demand from Period 1 to Period 5: 67, 71, 54, 68, 54. The mean for these 5 periods is 62.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 8.2. The promised lead time is 0, and performance history confirms that all orders have arrived in the same period they were placed (lead_time = 0). There are currently 18 units on hand and 0 in transit. I will use the recent 5 periods (N=5) to set the \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 parameters to capture this stabilized higher demand regime while ignoring the much lower pre-transition historical samples. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current run rate of ~63 units per period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. Historical demand from February to mid-March (Periods 1-6) shows a stable regime following the late-January shift, with demand values: 67, 71, 54, 68, 54, 49. This results in a mean of 60.5 and a standard deviation of approximately 9.38. All orders desde Period 1 have arrived in the same period (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current stable regime while excluding the very low pre-February demand (11-12 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~80th percentile), which is appropriate for this lingerie SKU to avoid stockouts during this sustained demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in February-March period (N=6) at a mean of ~61 units (\u03c3 \u2248 9.4), slightly lower than the initial Period 5 estimate but significantly above pre-February levels.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/4/01. Historical performance for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) indicates a stable demand regime since early February. The mean demand over the last 7 periods (Periods 1-7) is 60.28 units (67, 71, 54, 68, 54, 49, 59) with a standard deviation of 8.28. Period 7 saw a demand of 59, which aligns with this stable trend. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments to date have arrived within the same period (actual lead time consistently 0), so L is set to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this post-January stabilized regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~60 units plus a safety buffer while minimizing inventory holding costs for the currently low inventory level (Ending On-hand: 10).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable through March: Period 1-7 mean demand is 60.3 units (\u03c3 \u2248 8.3), showing consistency in the high-demand phase established in February.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '506098007' (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime established in February. In Period 8 (2019/4/1), we observed a demand spike to 85 units, which exceeded the starting on-hand inventory of 68, resulting in 17 units of lost sales and an ending inventory of 0. The average demand over the last 8 periods (since the regime shift) is approximately 63.4 units, with a standard deviation of 11.2. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as evidenced by 'arrived=ordered' in the same period for all history. For Period 9, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current stable regime's mean and volatility while incorporating the recent high-demand signal. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent stockout risk (z-score for 80% service level based on $4 profit/$1 holding cost) and covers the expected demand for the upcoming week.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in Period 8 (85 units) led to a stockout and 17 lost sales, suggesting a potential seasonal increase or higher volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 11.2 over the last 8 periods).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product (Push-up bras) has settled into a higher demand regime compared to the early January samples. Over the last 9 weeks (since Period 1), the mean demand has been approximately 62.7 units. However, Period 8 saw a spike to 85 units resulting in lost sales, followed by a return to 57 units in Period 9. The volatility (sigma) has increased due to this recent fluctuation. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent more stockouts like in Period 8 while respecting the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full high-regime behavior since Feb 11th, which balances the recent spike with the subsequent normalization.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed for Feb-April: Mean demand has stabilized at ~63 units (N=9) with increased volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 10.5) following a temporary spike in early April.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the demand history for the 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' since the significant regime shift in early February (Period 1), demand has been consistently higher and more volatile than the initial January samples. Over the last 10 periods (N=10), the mean demand is 61.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 10.4. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 10 completed periods showing same-period arrival. Although a spike occurred in Period 8 (85 units), the last two periods have retreated to the mid-50s (57, 55). To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (profit/holding ratio of 4:1), I will use the established recent regime (N=10) to set parameters. This captures the current mean of ~62 units and the elevated volatility observed in the spring months.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 506098007 (Push-up bra) has been remarkably stable since February, following a significant jump from early January levels. Over the last 11 periods (Feb-April), the mean demand is approximately 61.5 units (standard deviation ~10.4). The last three periods show a slight cooling or stabilization (57, 55, 52 units). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods with no lost shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 19. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the OR backend should target a higher service level (approx 80th percentile). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 periods (N=11) to capture the stable high-demand regime established in February while including the volatility from the Period 8 spike.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 506098007 (Women's Lingerie) is currently in a stable demand regime after the initial late-January surge. Examining the last 12 periods (Feb 11 - Apr 29), the mean demand is approximately 59.7 units with a standard deviation of 10.1. However, the most recent four periods (P9-P12) show a slight downward trend (57, 55, 52, 45), suggesting a potential stabilization at a slightly lower mean closer to 52-55 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). With on-hand inventory at 25 units and no in-transit stock, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent stabilized trend while balancing the slight recent decrease against the earlier higher demand. Using N=6 for sigma_hat will provide a volatility estimate that accounts for recent fluctuations (\u03c3 \u2248 4.5 in the last 4 periods vs \u03c3 \u2248 10 over 12 periods). This configuration ensures sufficient base stock to meet expected demand in the current period while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further in April/May: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P9-P12) decreased to 52.3 units from the previous average of ~63, suggesting a gradual normalization of the seasonal trend.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' has shown a consistent downward trend over the last five periods (P9-P13), declining from 57 down to 37 units. This suggests the seasonal peak observed in February-April is tapering off as we move into May. The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 44.7 units, and the standard deviation has decreased as well. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and higher holding costs in this decelerating demand environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=5) to capture this cooling trend (average of ~49 units). This ensures the base stock reflects current lower velocity while still providing a buffer against recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction confirmed in May: Average demand for P9-P13 (5 periods) dropped to 49.2 units, a ~22% decrease from the February-April average of ~63 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' has stabilized in a lower regime throughout May. Looking at the last 6 periods (P9-P14), which represent the post-peak environment, demand values are [57, 55, 52, 45, 37, 45]. The mean for the most recent 5 periods (P10-P14) is 46.8 units. The carry-over insights confirm this contraction in demand from the earlier February-April average of ~63 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical arrival messages. To avoid over-ordering during this cooling phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current lower mean and volatility (~7.2). This choice balances the risk of holding costs against the 80% service level target implied by the profit/holding cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction confirmed: Mean demand for the May period (P10-P14) has stabilized at 46.8 units, down from the February-April average of ~63 units (-25%).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' has continued to stabilize in May. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P11-P15), the demand values are 52, 45, 37, 45, and 45. This results in a mean of 44.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 5.4. This is a significant decrease from the February-April peak (mean ~63), confirming the contraction documented in previous Carry-Over Insights. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To optimize inventory for the current demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the May period) and maintaining the lead time at the promised default of 0. This approach aims to reduce holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the lower demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in May (P11-P15) at a lower mean of 44.8 units (\u03c3 \u2248 5.4), confirming a 28% decrease from the spring peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 16 was significantly higher than the recent May trend, resulting in a stockout (68 units demanded, only 50 sold). This jump (68 vs a May average of ~45) suggests either a new demand regime starting in June or specific end-of-month volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, the backend will place an order at the start of Period 17 that arrives within the same period. To recover from the stockout and account for this higher demand level, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (P12-P16: 45, 37, 45, 45, 68), which averages 48. mu_hat is (1+L)*mean, so for L=0, it is 42. Since Period 16 demand was 68, a recent_N of 5 is a conservative middle ground. I will set L to 'default' as shipments have consistently arrived in 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late May/early June: Period 16 demand spiked to 68 units after 5 periods of stabilization near 45 units, causing a stockout of 18 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of relative stability (approx. 45 units) followed by high volatility in June (P16: 68 units, P17: 37 units). Period 16 resulted in 18 lost sales, indicating that the baseline of 45 units was insufficient for spikes. While P17 demand dropped to 37, the item (Women's Lingerie) often sees volatility transitioning into the summer season. Given the confirmed lead time (L=0) and current on-hand inventory of 21, the OR engine needs to set a base stock that covers potential spikes while acknowledging lower recent demand. I will use a recent window (N=4) for mu_hat to include the spike (P16) and the normalization (P17, P15, P14), averaging ~48.75. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the increased variance seen in June compared to the stable May period, providing a safer buffer against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in June: Period 16 spike (68) and Period 17 drop (37) contrast with May's stability around 45 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last three periods (P16-P18), demand has been highly erratic (68, 37, 21), deviating from the May average of ~45 units. The most recent demand of 21 units (Period 18) suggests a potential downward trend or significant mid-June volatility for this lingerie SKU. Given the recent variability, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new lower demand regime and increased volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 19.5). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0. The stockout risk from P16 has abated, and current on-hand inventory (37) is relatively high considering the most recent demand (21).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility significantly increased in June: P16-P18 demand (68, 37, 21) shows a sharp downward trend compared to the May average of 45 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '506098007' is a push-up bra, which typically follows seasonal demand patterns. In Period 19, demand was 38 units, staying within the volatile range observed in June (which has seen demand of 68, 37, 21, and now 38). The earlier 'CARRY-OVER INSIGHT' of a sharp downward trend in June is stabilizing into a lower-demand regime compared to the spring peak of ~63 units. Given the lead time remains consistently 0, the target base stock will be set based on the recent regime (last 6 periods, P14-P19) to capture the current lower, yet volatile, demand (mean ~42). I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend captures the current stabilized demand levels while accounting for June's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in June: Mean demand for the last 6 periods (P14-P19) is 42.3 units, confirming a shift from the spring average of ~63 to a lower summer level.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 506098007 shows a significant spike in the most recent period (Period 20: 89 units), which follows a period of lower demand in June (P17-P19 averaged ~32 units). This spike caused a stockout (ending inventory = 0). While June demand appeared to be stabilizing at a lower level (~42 units), this recent jump suggests either high volatility or a new upward shift as we enter July. To account for this, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (P17-P20) to capture the recent volatility and the high P20 demand while tempering the extreme spike. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to reflect the increased standard deviation from the 89-unit demand event. The lead time remains at the promised 0 periods, which is confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in late June: Period 20 demand (89 units) is significantly higher than the June average (~32-42), triggering a stockout and suggesting a shift as the calendar moves into July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 506098007 (Women's Push-up Bra) is experiencing a sharp seasonal demand surge as of early July. Looking at the last few periods: P19(38), P20(89), P21(110). This follows a pattern where late June and early July demand has significantly outpaced June averages (~42 units). This surge has resulted in two consecutive stockouts (Lost Sales of 33 in P20 and 38 in P21), which depletes on-hand inventory to zero. Calendar check: early July often sees summer sales or seasonal shifts in lingerie/apparel. Given that on-hand is currently 0 and the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, I must set parameters to capture this new high-demand regime. The mean of the last 3 periods (P19-P21) is 79, but the trend is clearly upward (38 -> 89 -> 110). I will use the 'explicit' method to forecast a mu_hat of 120 (reflecting the 110 observed + a buffer for the upward trajectory) to prevent a third consecutive stockout. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to account for the high volatility observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand surge confirmed in July: Demand increased from June average of ~42 to 89 (P20) and 110 (P21), representing a >160% increase and resulting in consecutive stockouts.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-growth seasonal demand phase for July. In the last three periods (P20-P22), demand has accelerated from 89 to 110 to 169. This trend results in a clear 'out-of-stock' pattern as the current order quantities (based on trailing averages) are insufficient. The actual lead time is consistently 0. To capture this rapid growth without over-relying on a long history that includes lower June/May demand, I will use an explicit forecast. The demand jumped ~23% from P20-P21 and ~53% from P21-P22. To balance the risk of stockouts against the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am setting mu_hat to 185 (reflecting a continued but slightly moderated growth from 169) and increasing sigma_hat to 35 to handle the high volatility observed during these spikes. This aggressive stance aims to prevent a fourth consecutive stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed for July: Demand transitioned from a June average of ~38 units to 89 (P20), 110 (P21), and 169 (P22), marking a compounding growth phase that has caused persistent stockouts.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a strong seasonal acceleration throughout July. After consecutive stockouts in Period 20 (89 units), Period 21 (110 units), and Period 22 (169 units), the demand in Period 23 was 107 units. While 107 is lower than the peak of 169, it is still significantly higher than the June average (~40 units), confirming we are in a high-demand regime. The stock on hand (108 units) is almost exactly one period's worth of the most recent demand. To maintain a safety buffer and account for the high volatility observed in this growth phase (\u03c3 is roughly 35-40 over the last 4 weeks), I am setting mu_hat slightly higher than the Period 23 result to ensure we bridge toward potential late-summer demand peaks. The confirmed lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high-level summer peak: July demand (P20-P23) averaged 118.8 units, a 180% increase over the June average (~42).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' has reached a high-level summer plateau in July. After a significant acceleration with a peak of 169 units in Period 22, demand has settled around the ~107 unit mark for the last two weeks (P23: 107, P24: 106). This indicates the 'compounding growth' phase has transitioned into a 'stabilized peak' phase. The avg demand for the total high-demand July period (P20-P24) is 116.2 units. Given the transition from rapid growth to a stable high (106-107 units), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect this current peak level (~112 units per period for L+1) to avoid over-ordering as the growth curve flattens, while maintaining enough stock to prevent another stockout. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high-level summer peak in late July: Demand for P23-P24 (107, 106) suggests the hyper-growth phase of early July has cooled into a stable peak around 106-110 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant seasonal peak in July followed by a moderation in late July and early August. Demand for the most recent periods (P23-P25) was 107, 106, and 68 units respectively. The spike seen in early July (up to 169) has subsided. Comparing the last three periods, the mean is approximately 93.7 units. However, Period 25 (68 units) suggests a sharper decline as we enter August, moving away from the July lingerie/summer peak. To balance the risk of overstocking against the still-high historical summer levels, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (covering the start of the decline) to capture the current downward trend while maintaining enough safety stock for lingering summer demand. Transitioning from the 'explicit' high-stock approach used in July back to a data-driven approach. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderating after July peak: Demand dropped from an average of ~119 in early July to 68 in late July (P25), signaling the end of the hyper-peak summer phase.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 506098007 has passed its summer peak (July) and is currently moderating. After a hyper-peak where demand reached 169 units (Period 22), the last four periods (P23-P26) have shown demand values of 107, 106, 68, and 59. This downward trend indicates a seasonal shift as we move into mid-August. The mean demand for the last 3 periods (P24-P26) is 77.7 units, which is a more appropriate representative of the current 'moderating' regime than the full July average (~118). However, to avoid over-correcting for a single low data point while still capturing the decline, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 for mu_hat (covering the deceleration phase P23-P26, avg = 85.0). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderating in August: Mean demand for P24-P26 dropped to 77.7 units from the July peak of ~118, confirming the end of the summer seasonal surge.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 506098007 has stabilized following the significant July peak. Observations from the last four periods (P24-P27) show demand values of 106, 68, 59, and 55. This confirms a downward trend from the July average (~119) toward a more moderate late-summer/early-fall level. The mean demand over the last three periods is approximately 60.7 units, and the standard deviation has stabilized as the hyper-volatility of July subsided. Given the promised lead time of 0 has been consistently met, I will continue to use it. To respond to this moderating trend and avoid excess inventory holding costs while still maintaining a sufficient service level for this $4 profit item, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent stabilizing mean (~72 units) and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderating in August: Mean demand for P25-P27 (last 3 periods) is 60.7 units, down from the July peak of ~118 and the early August average of ~78.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period of late August (Period 29, 2019/8/26) has clearly moderated from the July peak of ~118 units. The last four periods (P25-P28) show demand values of 68, 59, 55, and 57, demonstrating stability around a mean of 59.75 units. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 28 that the summer surge is over and demand has settled into a lower, stable late-summer/early-fall regime. Given this stability, I am using N=4 (the duration of this new regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as observed throughout the history. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 will align the base stock with this current 60-unit demand level, preventing excessive holding costs as we exit the peak season while maintaining enough service level to cover the observed volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 5.6 over these 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late August: P25-P28 demand (68, 59, 55, 57) confirms a new mean of ~60 units, a 50% reduction from the July hyper-peak.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 506098007 has stabilized following the July hyper-peak (~118 units). In late August (Periods 25-29), demand moved into a steady range: 68, 59, 55, 57, and 49 units, respectively. This gives a 5-period average of approximately 57.6 units. Since the most recent observation (Period 29) shows 49 units, it suggests a continued gradual moderation as we enter September. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 7 in this recent window), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the stable late-August period). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'ordered on Period Z, lead_time was 0 periods' messages. This strategy ensures we cover the current demand regime of ~58 units/period without being biased by the high-volume July data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late August/early September: P25-P29 mean demand is 57.6 units, confirming a transition from the mid-August average of ~78 to a lower, stable post-summer state.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Liza Push bra has clearly exited its July hyper-peak (~119 units) and mid-August moderation phase (~78 units). Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), demand has stabilized at a lower mean of 54.5 units (68, 59, 55, 57, 49, 39). The most recent period (P30) saw a further dip to 39 units, suggesting the post-summer decline may still be in progress as we enter September. I am setting N=6 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized 'late summer/early autumn' regime (mean ~55), which aligns with the carry-over insight indicating a new mean of ~60 units established in late August. With a lead time of 0 (consistently observed), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current lower-volume, lower-volatility state while allowing the OR backend to maintain sufficient stock for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late August/early September (P25-P30): Mean demand has shifted to ~55 units (confirmed 50%+ reduction from July peak).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 506098007 has shown a clear downward trend since the July peak (~119 units). The post-summer moderation started in August and has bottomed out further in the last two periods, with demand dropping to 39 and 29 units. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 45.8 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) show 39.0 units. Given the transition into mid-September, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this lower stabilization level by using recent_N=5 (capturing the post-August shift) to prevent excessive overstocking as demand cools. Volatility is also lower; sigma_hat will be set using the same recent window to align with current behavior. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in mid-September: Mean demand for P29-P31 dropped to 39.0 units, confirming a further reduction from the late-August stabilization of ~55 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 506098007 (Liza Push Melbourne 2pk) has continued its downward trend following the July seasonal peak. The most recent three periods (P30-P32) show demand of 39, 29, and 31 units respectively, averaging approximately 33 units. This confirms the 'mid-September shift' noted in the Carry-over Insights (previously estimated at 39.0 based on P29-P31). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime across the last month (P29-P32), which averages 37 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for highly responsive inventory adjustments. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend captures the significantly reduced volume and volatility compared to the summer months.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in September: Mean demand for P30-P32 is 33.0 units, confirming a further reduction from the late-August mean of ~55.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (Sept 23), demand spiked unexpectedly to 142 units, a significant departure from the September trend of ~33 units. This caused a complete stockout. While the previous weeks suggested a seasonal decline, this sudden surge\u2014possibly related to end-of-quarter promotions or a new seasonal transition\u2014requires an aggressive response to prevent further lost sales. I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use an explicit forecast of 150 units for the next period, reflecting the impact of the 142-unit demand observe. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for the heightened volatility observed between the prior low-demand weeks and this sudden spike. Lead time remains 0 as per consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in late September: Period 33 demand spiked to 142 units, nearly 4x the previous 3-week average (~36), causing a stockout of 97 lost units and signaling a new high-demand regime or a major transient event.

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (Sept 23), demand spiked to 142 units, a 4x increase from the previous September average of ~33 units. This caused a major stockout. In Period 34 (Sept 30), demand moderated to 63 units, which is still significantly higher (+90%) than the pre-spike September level. This pattern suggests a new higher-demand regime as we enter October, possibly related to seasonal stock refreshes or early promotional activity for lingerie. Given the high volatility (142, 63) compared to the preceding weeks, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 100 to provide a buffer against further spikes while avoiding excessive overstocking, as the last 2-week average is approximately 102.5. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for the high variance observed between the spike and the subsequent period. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in late September/early October: Demand spiked to 142 (P33) and moderated to 63 (P34), establishing a new mean of ~100 units, significantly up from the early September mean of ~33.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019-10-07 (Period 35) was 44 units, following a volatile shift in late September (142 units in P33 and 63 units in P34). This suggests the late September spike was likely a transient event or a short-lived seasonal peak, as demand has now moderated back towards the historical average of ~45-50 units seen in the post-summer/pre-autumn phase. However, the recent mean for the last 3 periods (P33-P35) remains elevated at ~83 units due to the P33 outlier. To balance the risk of another spike against the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am choosing a recent_N method with N=5 (P31-P35) for mu_hat. This provides a mean estimate of ~62 units, which is a safe middle ground between the long-term stable mean (~45) and the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderated in early October (P35: 44 units) following a major late-September spike (P33: 142 units), suggesting the spike was transient rather than a sustained regime shift.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' is currently in a post-spike moderation phase in mid-October. A significant outlier occurred in Period 33 (142 units), which initially suggested a regime shift, but subsequent demand in Periods 34-36 (63, 44, 47) indicates a return to a levels closer to the early September baseline (approx. 40-50 units). The mean demand over the last three periods (P34-P36) is 51.3 units. Given the inventory on-hand (55 units), we are currently well-covered for the next period. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this recent stabilization while still accounting for the slightly higher levels following the outlier, and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to include the volatility introduced by the spike without over-penalizing the stock levels. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-September-spike has stabilized at a mean of ~51 units (P34-P36), which is higher than the pre-spike September average of ~33 units but significantly lower than the spike itself.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant but transient spike in late September (P33: 142 units), which has since moderated. The last four periods (P34-P37) show demand of 63, 44, 47, and 40 units respectively (average ~48.5). This aligns with the post-spike stabilization noted in previous insights. Given the product (Liza Push Melbourne Bra), we are entering the pre-holiday season, but currently see steady demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current stable regime of ~49 units. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 506098007 has remained stable following the transient spike in late September (P33). Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 48.0 units (63, 44, 47, 40, 46) with low volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 8.7). This confirms the stabilization noted in the Carry-over Insights around a mean of ~48-51. As we move into November, there is no immediate evidence of a pre-holiday surge yet for this specific lingerie category, but maintaining a slight buffer for typical seasonal variance is prudent. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-spike stabilization regime, which ensures the base stock reflects the current stable demand of ~48 units while ignoring the P33 outlier that would otherwise inflate inventory and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in October: Mean demand for P34-P38 is 48.0 units (\u03c3 \u2248 8.7), confirming a return to pre-spike levels and a consistent low-volatility state heading into November.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019-11-04 (Period 39) was 30 units, continuing a gradual decline from the October average of ~48 units. We are now in mid-November (2019-11-11). Historically, this SKU (Womens Lingerie) saw significant spikes in July and late September, but demand has since stabilized and moderated. For the last 5 periods (P35-P39), the mean demand is 41.4 units with a standard deviation of 7.4. Given the current date is heading into the late-year holiday season, but recent data shows a cooling trend, I will use a recent window (N=5) to reflect the current stabilized state while maintaining a defensive buffer against potential holiday surges. On-hand inventory is 26, and lead time has consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderating in November: Mean demand for P35-P39 dropped to 41.4 units, down from the October average of ~48 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has been gradually moderating since October, with Period 40 showing a further decrease to 22 units. The 'Period 40 conclude' shows that the lead time remains 0 periods as promised (ordered P40, arrived P40). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is ~37 units with a standard deviation of ~10.4. Given the product (lingerie) and the time of year (mid-November), demand is expected to remain stable or slightly increase towards the late-November/December holiday period. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilization and slight downward trend, while maintaining sufficient safety stock for potential late-November spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderating in November: Mean demand for P36-P40 is 37.0 units, continuing the downward stabilization from the October average of ~48 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for Period 41 was 18 units, continuing a clear downward trend in November (22 units in P40, 30 units in P39). This indicates a transition to a lower-demand regime as we approach late November. The previous carry-over insight noted a stabilization around 37-41 units, but recent samples suggest it is now even lower (~23 units avg for the last 3 periods). I will set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this cooling demand without over-reacting to a single week, while maintaining the promised lead time of 0 as it has been consistently honored throughout the game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction in late November: Mean demand for P39-P41 (last 3 periods) dropped to 23.3 units, a significant decrease from the early November average of ~37-41 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Demand for the SKU 506098007 (Push-up bras) has been in a sustained contraction phase since late October. The last 4 periods (P39-P42) show demand values of 30, 22, 18, and 33, resulting in a mean of 25.75 units. This is a significant drop from the October average of ~48 units. Given the transition into December, we must balance the current downward trend against the potential for holiday-related spikes in the lingerie/gift category, though recent history (P39-P42) doesn't show a 'Black Friday' spike yet. I will set N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent lower-demand regime (25.75 units per period) while maintaining a baseline sigma to handle variability. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction confirmed for November-December transition: Mean demand for P39-P42 dropped to 25.8 units, a ~46% decrease from the October average (~48 units).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019. The product (Womens Lingerie) has shown a significant seasonal decline as winter has progressed. The demand mean has dropped from approximately 48 units in October to an average of 25.8 units over the last four weeks (P40-P43: 22, 18, 33, 9). Period 43 specifically saw a very low demand of 9 units. Given the transition into the holiday season and the established trend, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to reflect this lower demand regime (~25.5 units per period). Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to capture the recent volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 10.3). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, so I will maintain the default. This conservative approach balances the lower demand with the potential for minor holiday spikes while minimizing holding costs on a low-margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost) item.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction confirmed for December: mean demand for P40-P43 dropped to 25.5 units, a 47% decrease from the October average (~48 units).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Liza Push Melbourne 2 bra set has entered a significant downward trend in late 2019. In the last four periods (P41-P44), demand has been 18, 33, 9, and 8, averaging approximately 17 units per period. This is a sharp contraction from the October average of ~48 and the November average of ~30. Given the date (Dec 16), demand is likely bottoming out or stabilizing at a very low level for the winter season. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking in this low-demand regime where holding costs ($1) are relatively high compared to profit ($4), I will use a short-window recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent December contraction while maintaining the lead time at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction into mid-December (P41-P44): Mean demand dropped to 17.0 units, a ~65% decrease from the October average (~48) and a ~43% decrease from November (~30).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. Demand for this SKU has entered a significant downward trend as we move into the end of the year. The last five periods (P41-P45) show demand levels of 18, 33, 9, 8, and 20, resulting in a mean of 17.6 units. This is a sharp contraction from the October mean of ~48 and the November average of ~37. Given the 'Carry-over Insights' confirming this contraction, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime (approx 17.6 units per period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture the recent volatility within this lower range. Lead time L will remain at the promised 0 periods as arrivals have consistently been same-period (actual L=0). This approach prevents overstocking during the year-end slowdown while maintaining enough buffer for small spikes like P45's 20 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction into late December confirmed: Mean demand for P41-P45 is 17.6 units, reflecting a ~63% decrease from October levels.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P41-P46) shows a sustained low-demand regime for late November and December, following a significant contraction from October peaks. Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 17.5 units over the last 6 periods (P41: 18, P42: 33, P43: 9, P44: 8, P45: 20, P46: 17). The current date is December 30, heading into the first week of January. Historically, the provided samples show early January demand started at 11-12 units before rising. Given the high consistency of the current low-demand phase (last 4 periods average 13.5), N is set to 6 to capture the stabilization after the November drop while remaining sensitive to current levels. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late December (P43-P46) at a lower mean of 13.5 units, continuing the contraction from the late-autumn average of ~40 units.
