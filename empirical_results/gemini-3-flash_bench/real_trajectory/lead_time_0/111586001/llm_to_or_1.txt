Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 111586001 (Women's Tights). Historical demand from the previous 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 106.6 units (68, 109, 126, 114, 116) with a standard deviation of approximately 22.4. There is a slight upward trend from the initial observation, potentially due to post-holiday normalization or seasonal factors. Promised lead time (L) is 0. Since we have no on-hand inventory or in-transit units, and the backend needs to compute an order for period 1 (arrival and demand resolution happen after my decision), I will use the recent 5 data points to set the demand forecast. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50. This means the base stock will target the median demand. I'll use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level most accurately.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', a basic hosiery item. In Period 1, we ordered 107 units with a promised lead time of 0, and they arrived immediately (lead_time = 0 confirmed). However, demand in Period 1 was 147, which exceeded our order and resulted in 0 ending inventory and 40 lost sales. This indicates that the historical demand mean (approx 106.6) is currently underestimating actual demand, possibly due to a recent shift or seasonal trend in February. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent information (including the high Period 1 demand) and 'explicit' for L to match the confirmed lead time of 0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', which typically sees stable but potentially increasing demand moving into spring. Current history for Period 1 and Period 2 shows demand (147, 178) significantly exceeding the provided pre-game historical samples (mean ~106). In both periods, we stocked out because the OR engine's orders (107 and 123) were insufficient to cover the actual observed demand. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time matches (0 periods), I will set L to 0. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast that accounts for the most recent demand growth (from 147 to 178) and the pre-game trend. I'll set mu_hat to 185 to prevent further stockouts while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0/unit, which is 100% of profit). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (including pre-game samples) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Post-2019-02-04 demand (147, 178) is significantly higher than pre-game average (~106). Current stockouts indicate the base stock level is too low for actual demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 1-3: 147, 178, 141) averages 155.3, which is significantly higher than the pre-game average of ~106. The product is 30 denier tights, which usually sees stable demand in early spring (March). Period 1 and 2 resulted in stockouts due to under-projection. Period 3 finally met demand with an ending inventory of 44. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and volatility. With L=0, the target base stock calculation will be for (L+1)=1 period of demand. As profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the service level z* will be \u03a6\u22121(0.5) = 0, meaning the base stock will target the mean. Given previous stockouts, using the last 3 periods (N=3) provides a more accurate mean (155) than the global average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~155 units/week (P1-P3 avg) vs pre-game 106; Lead time confirmed constant at 0 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', which is a staple item but can see moderate seasonal demand. Historical demand since the start of the game (P1-P4) has been significantly higher (avg 148.75) than the pre-game samples (avg 106.6). Specifically: P1=147, P2=178, P3=141, and P4=129. While the last two periods show a slight regression from the P2 peak, the mean remains elevated compared to the initial baseline. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (orders placed in N arrive in N). With on-hand at 27 units, a stockout is likely if the order is not sufficient. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this new elevated regime while slightly cooling off from the P2 spike. Given the high stockout risk observed in P1 and P2 when inventory was too low, a consistent mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the game history is necessary.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation period is Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', which typically sees stable demand but with potential slight variation. History shows lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the start of the game (Period 1), demand samples have been: 147, 178, 141, 129, and 107. The initial spike (147, 178) has subsided, and demand over the last three periods (141, 129, 107) is trending lower, averaging ~126 units. Comparing this to the pre-game samples (avg ~107), we are currently in a regime closer to historical norms than the initial game spike. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the entirety of the game-play demand pattern while filtering out the pre-game lower baseline, as demand remains consistently above those initial levels. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Profit/Holding ratio is 1:1, meaning the target service level is 50%; the OR backend will calculate a base stock near the mean demand for the lead time + review period.

Carry-over insight: Demand has normalized from the initial Period 1-2 spike; the last 3 periods avg 126 units compared to 162.5 in Periods 1-2.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', which generally shows steady demand in spring. In Period 7 (2019/3/25), on-hand inventory is critically low (2 units). Historical demand analysis: The initial spike in P1-P2 (147, 178) has subsided, with the recent 4 periods (P3-P6) averaging 129 units (141, 129, 107, 139). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all completed periods. Given the high stockout risk in P1-P2, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current stable demand level while ignoring the initial outlier spike. Sigma_hat is set to the same window to reflect recent volatility. The OR backend uses an equal profit/holding cost ratio ($1.0 each), which targets a 50% service level; by using explicit L=0 and mu_hat based on the last 4 weeks (avg ~129), the base stock will aim to cover the current period's expected demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $129.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. In Period 7, demand spiked to 166 units, exceeding our starting on-hand of 129, resulting in a stockout. We ended Period 7 with 0 inventory. The historical lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the start of the game (Period 1-7), weekly demand has averaged approximately 144 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-game calculation. The recent spike (166) suggests that demand is not decreasing as previously thought, but remains volatile around a higher mean. I will use a recent_N of 7 to capture the higher game-period average (approx 143.8) for mu_hat and use explicit for sigma_hat (approx 25) to account for the increased volatility seen in the game periods compared to the pre-game data. This setting targets a 50% service level (Profit = Holding Cost), but the cap/base stock logic ensures we cover demand plus a safety margin.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Demand volatility remains high with a significant spike to 166 units in P7; overall game-period mean (~144) is sustained and significantly higher than pre-game (~106).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/08. The product is 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', a basic hosiery item. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrived in same period placed). Analyzing demand: Pre-game mean was ~106. Game-period demands are: 147, 178, 141, 129, 107, 139, 166, 112. The mean during the game (P1-P8) is 139.1. Demand remains volatile but centered around 140. Looking at calendar context, there are no immediate major holidays (Easter is late April in 2019, coming up on April 21), which might explain the high volatility and occasional spikes as customers shop ahead. Since L=0, on-hand needs to cover only the current period's demand. I will use the last 8 samples (all game periods) to better capture the higher mean and volatility compared to the historical baseline. This will set mu_hat close to ~140 (1+0)*139.1 to ensure adequate stock for the persistent higher demand level.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is tights/leggings. Reviewing historical demand within the game periods (P1 to P9), we see a mean of approximately 139 units (147, 178, 141, 129, 107, 139, 166, 112, 131). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period). Stockouts occurred in P1, P2, and P7 when demand spiked, indicating the need for a robust base stock that accounts for this volatility. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% for the base stock calculation, which the OR backend will handle. Given the demand regime has remained significantly higher than pre-game levels but shows localized fluctuations, I will use recent_N=9 to capture all in-game data while excluding the lower pre-game historical samples (which averaged ~106). This provides a mu_hat based on the current active regime (~139/period).

Carry-over insight: In-game demand regime (P1-P9) is firmly established with a mean of ~139 units/period, compared to the pre-game mean of ~106. Volatility remains significant with peaks up to 178.

Historically, the in-game demand (P1-P10) has averaged 135 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-game baseline of 106. However, demand in the most recent period (P10) dropped to 100, the lowest since the game started. Despite this dip, the 10-period volatility remains high (CV ~0.18). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the OR backend's target service level (q) is 50%, making mu_hat the primary driver for the order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the sustained higher in-game demand level while smoothing out the recent low point in Period 10, ensuring we maintain enough stock for the observed 135-unit average rather than reacting too sharply to a single low-demand period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand for the last five periods (P7-P11) has been 166, 112, 131, 100, and 103, showing a downward trend or normalization compared to the early-game spikes (P1-P2 reached 178). Specifically, the last three periods (P9-P11) averaged 111.33 units, which is closer to the pre-game mean of 106 than the initial game-phase mean of ~140. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level logic (q = 0.5) targets the median of the demand distribution. I am choosing N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent cooling of demand while maintaining enough volume to cover the volatility seen in Period 7. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand has softened in the last 3 periods (P9-P11 avg: 111 vs P1-P8 avg: 139), returning closer to pre-game levels.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Shape Up Tights' product. Analysis of the recent demand (P9-P12) shows a shift back toward the pre-game mean of 106. Specifically, the last 4 periods have demand of 131, 100, 103, and 113, averaging 111.75. This is a significant drop from the P1-P8 mean of ~139. The most recent demand regime (last 4 periods) is stable. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 13 is in early May, there are no immediate major calendar spikes expected for this segment. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower demand regime while maintaining enough of a buffer for the observed volatility. With Profit=1 and Holding=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine targets the median (mu_hat).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 10: Demand has returned to lower levels (avg ~107 over P10-P12) after a sustained high period (avg ~139 over P1-P9).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. The product is 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', which typically sees stable demand across the spring season but may experience slight variations as the weather warms. In Period 13, a stockout occurred (sold 112 with demand 124), resulting in zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory entering Period 14. This stockout was driven by the OR engine's recent reduction in base stock due to a detected lower demand regime from P10-P12 (avg ~107). However, P13's demand of 124 suggests that while demand is lower than the early-game peak, it remains higher and more volatile than the pre-game baseline (~106). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and handle current demand volatility, I will use a recent window that captures the post-peak stability (Periods 9-13, N=5). This window has a mean of 114.2 and a standard deviation indicating moderate volatility. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (critical fractile 0.5), the OR engine will target the median demand; setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 ensures the backend accounts for the latest demand levels to avoid further stockouts.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical data and Carry-over Insights indicate two distinct demand regimes: an initial high-demand phase (P1-P9, mean ~139) followed by a regression to a lower mean starting around P10. Over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), the demand values were 100, 103, 113, 124, and 83, averaging 104.6. This aligns with the pre-game baseline (~106) and justifies using a recent window to capture this normalized demand profile. Lead time is consistently 0 (orders arrive same-period as placed), which simplifies the calculation as base_stock only needs to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. Given equal profit ($1) and holding costs ($1), the OR engine target service level is 50%, aiming for the median. We set N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the earlier high-demand spike.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant decline over the last two periods (P14: 83, P15: 58) compared to the established regime mean of ~110. This product (30 denier tights) typically sees lower demand moving into late spring/summer months in many regions. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (base_stock = mean). To avoid excessive holding costs as demand softens seasonally, I am transitioning to a shorter lookback window (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend more effectively than the long-term game mean. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game, so 'default' is retained for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening trend confirmed: Periods 14-15 show a sharp decrease (mean 70.5) compared to the Period 10-13 average (~110). This likely reflects decreasing seasonal demand for tights/leggings in late May.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is tights/leggings, which are strongly seasonal with low demand during the summer months. Historical data confirms a sharp decline in demand starting in mid-May (P14: 83, P15: 58, P16: 25). The last recorded demand of 25 is lower than any previously observed period. Given this established downward trend entering summer, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand regime (P14-P16 mean ~55, std ~24). This helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering during this seasonal trough. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal low confirmed: Demand dropped significantly from late May (P14), reaching a period low of 25 in P16. Demand for tights/leggings is expected to remain low through the summer months.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. We are selling 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', a product category (tights/leggings) that is highly seasonal with very low demand during the summer months. Historical demand confirms this trend: demand has dropped from ~110-140 units in early spring to 83, 58, 25, and 37 in the most recent four periods (P14-P17). The mean demand over these last four periods is approximately 50.75 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. With 35 units currently on hand, and demand trending very low, I need to prevent excess inventory accumulation while maintaining a minimal service level. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 50 based on the recent summer average (P14-P17) and use a recent_N sigma calculation to capture the high relative volatility seen during this downward shift.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights' has settled into a summer seasonal low, as confirmed in the carry-over insights. Over the last three periods (P16-P18), demand has been 25, 37, and 29, averaging 30.3 units per period. This represents a significant drop from the spring levels. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since Period 19 is squarely in the summer slump, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (average ~30) to avoid overstocking and high holding costs. sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=3 to reflect the current low-demand volatility context.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (tights/leggings) is in its summer seasonal low as expected for late June (Date: 2019/6/24). Demand over the last four periods (P16-P19) has consistently been low: 25, 37, 29, 15 (Average \u2248 26.5). The on-hand inventory of 16 units is slightly below this current mean. With Profit ($1) equal to Holding Cost ($1/period), the optimal service level is 50% (risk-neutral), meaning we should target the expected mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this sustained summer trough while managing the high inventory risk of the off-season. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal low firmly established: Periods 16-19 average demand is 26.5 units, a ~75% decrease from the P10-P13 average.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019, which is mid-summer. As established in previous carry-over insights, this SKU (shape-up tights) is experiencing a seasonal low. Demand in the most recent period (P20) was only 5 units, continuing a downward trend from the late May/June averages. The average demand over the last four periods (P17-P20) is 21.5 units, but the most recent two periods (P19-P20) average only 10 units. Given that the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the OR engine will target a 50% service level (z=0). With an on-hand inventory of 22 units, which is well above the very low demand observed in the last two weeks, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the summer low regime while providing enough weight to avoid a complete stockout if demand returns to the early-June average (~20-30 units). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights' has reached its seasonal trough, consistent with summer months. History shows a clear downward regime shift: the average demand from Period 19 to 21 is only 8 units per period (15, 5, 4), which is significantly lower than the previous regime (P16-P18 avg: 30.3). With 18 units currently on-hand and 0 in-transit, existing inventory is more than sufficient to cover the current extremely low demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To minimize holding costs during this low-demand phase while maintaining a service level for the few potential sales, I will shift mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to the last 5 periods (N=5), which captures the start of the <10 units/period trend (P17-P21 demand: 37, 29, 15, 5, 4). This will prevent the OR backend from over-ordering based on older, higher data points.

Carry-over insight: Sustained ultra-low demand regime detected (July summer trough): P19-P21 average demand is 8 units/period, down from ~26 units in early June.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of summer (mid-July), which is the seasonal low for tights/leggings. Demand has been extremely low for the past four periods (P19-P22 demand: 15, 5, 4, 13), averaging 9.25 units per period. This confirms the ultra-low demand regime noted in the carry-over insights. With 5 units currently on-hand and an expected demand of ~10 units, and a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, the OR backend needs parameters that reflect this low-volume, low-volatility environment to avoid unnecessary holding costs. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this specific July trough for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the explicit lead time of 0.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Shape Up 30 den Tights) is currently in a deep summer seasonal low, as evidenced by the last 5 periods (P19-P23) having an average demand of approximately 9.8 units/period. The most recent demand (P23) was 12 units, which slightly exceeded the starting on-hand inventory of 10, resulting in a stockout. With on-hand inventory now at 0 and the promised lead time being 0, I must order enough to cover the immediate demand of Period 24. Given the seasonal context of late July, demand is expected to remain low but stable near the current level (~10-15 units). Based on recent volatility, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current 'ultra-low' summer regime rather than the high spring average. This ensures we satisfy the small current demand without overstocking and incurring holding costs equal to our profit margin.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (Shape Up 30 den Tights) is currently in a deep summer seasonal low. Product demand for tights typically bottoms out in July/August. Historical demand data over the last 6 periods (P19-P24) shows values of 15, 5, 4, 13, 12, 5, averaging approximately 9 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 5, and the lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using a recent window (N=6) to capture this low-demand regime, ensuring we hold enough to meet these low levels without incurring excessive holding costs, as the profit and holding costs are equal ($1/unit). Sigma_hat will also be adjusted using the same window to reflect current volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26 (August 5th). This SKU (Shape Up 30 den Tights) is highly seasonal. The product has just completed its summer trough (July), where demand consistently averaged below 10 units. However, we are now entering August. Historical samples from early January (68-126 units) and the game's start in February (147-178 units) indicate that demand spikes significantly as the weather cools and the 'back-to-school' or 'autumn fashion' season approaches. The last few periods (P23-P25) saw a slight uptick in demand (12, 5, 15) compared to the absolute lows in early July (4, 13). With lead time confirmed at 0 periods, we need to begin increasing the inventory level to capture the upcoming seasonal recovery without incurring excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 35 units to prepare for the early August gradual rise, which is roughly 2.5x the recent July average but still conservative compared to the spring/winter peaks.

Carry-over insight: Entering August recovery phase: Demand for tights is expected to begin rising from the summer trough (avg ~8 units) as autumn approaches. Historical January demand suggests a return to 60+ units is likely in the coming month.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (Shape Up Tights) is exiting its summer seasonal trough and entering the August recovery phase. Period 26 demand spiked to 45 units, significantly higher than the July average of ~10 units. Historical data from early 2019 shows base demand levels around 100-110 units, and as we move into late August/September, demand for tights typically increases as part of the 'Back to School' and transition to autumn. My previous order of 35 units in Period 26 resulted in a stockout (sold 35, demand 45), confirming that demand is rising faster than the 'recent_N' average would suggest. To capture this growth and avoid further stockouts, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 65 (calculated as a step up from last period's demand of 45 towards the historical normal of 100+). Lead time remains stable at 0. Sigma_hat is set somewhat high using 'recent_N' (N=5) to account for the volatility inherent in seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Period 26 demand (45) is the highest since late May, marking the end of the summer trough (average ~10 units) and the start of the autumn build-up.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/19. Inventory is currently 0 with no in-transit units because lead time is consistently 0 periods. Demand for tights is clearly in an autumn recovery phase: Period 26 demand was 45 and Period 27 demand was 79, showing a steep upward trajectory as we exit the summer trough (where demand was <15). Historical January data shows levels around 100-110, and Feb/March peaked at 178. Given the current momentum and seasonal context (shifting from late summer to pre-autumn), I expect demand for Period 28 to continue rising toward the 90-110 range. Because the OR backend uses a capped policy (base_stock - pipeline), setting mu_hat explicitly to 110 (targeted for the current period + 0 lead time) and sigma_hat to 25 to account for recovery volatility will ensure we capture the upside and avoid stockouts without overstocking excessively, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1 (z*=0). Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery trajectory confirmed: Demand has risen from single digits in July to 45 (P26) and 79 (P27). Forecast for late August/early September should target 90-110 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-08-26. We are in the 'Autumn recovery' phase for tights/leggings. While demand in Period 28 (56) was lower than Period 27 (79), this follows two weeks of very strong growth (from single digits to 45 and 79). Historical data from January shows demand levels of 60-120 units are standard for non-summer periods. The current on-hand inventory is 54. Given the lead time is consistently 0 (confirmed by the Period 28 conclude message), I will set mu_hat to 100 to target the expected recovery level of ~90-110 units identified in Period 28's carry-over. This ensures we have enough stock if demand bounces back to P27 levels or higher, while the OR lead-time logic (1+L) will handle the baseline. Volatility is set explicitly to 25 to account for the recent swing between 79 and 56 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. Historical demand for this 'Shape Up Tights' SKU shows a strong seasonal pattern: demand plummeted in July (avg ~8) and is now in an autumn recovery phase. Recent periods show demand levels of 45 (P26), 79 (P27), 56 (P28), and 54 (P29). Although the last two weeks were lower than the P27 peak, target demand for early September typically aligns with the pre-game January/February levels (ranging 68-147). I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 to capture the start of this recovery trend while remaining cautious about the high volatility seen in the last two weeks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The OR backend will use the provided profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) to target a 50% service level, which is appropriate given the current high volatility and equal cost of overstocking vs understocking.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery phase entered: Demand moved from single-digits in July to an average of 58.5 units over the last 4 periods (P26-P29).

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for tights has surged significantly as of Period 30 (September 2nd), reaching 147 units. This confirms that the autumn recovery phase is accelerating faster than previously estimated and is returning to the high-demand levels seen in early spring (P1-P3). Current on-hand inventory is 0 after a major stockout in Period 30, where 147 units were demanded but only 59 were available. To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to 125 units per period using an explicit value. This is based on the recent trend (P26-P30 average is ~86, but P27 and P30 show spikes of 79 and 147 respectively) and the seasonality of the product. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to account for the high volatility typically seen during these seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Period 30 demand (147) matches early spring peaks, indicating a return to the high-demand regime (~130-140 units) following the summer trough.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for tights has surged significantly as we enter mid-September (Period 31 demand was 203), far exceeding the previous autumn recovery levels and early spring peaks. This indicates a very strong seasonal regime shift. My previous order was insufficient, leading to a stockout. We are now in a high-demand autumn phase. Given the product (tights) and the date (mid-September), I expect demand to remain high or continue to climb. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a baseline of 180 (approximating the recent peak but slightly conservative to balance holding costs), and use 'explicit' for sigma_hat with a high value of 40 to account for recent high volatility (147 to 203). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for September: Period 31 demand reached 203 units, surpassing the previous Period 30 peak of 147 and all early-year peaks (~170s).

We are in late September (2019/9/23) and the demand for tights has surged significantly as part of the autumn peak. Period 32 demand reached 215, following 203 in P31 and 147 in P30. This is a clear high-demand regime, significantly exceeding the spring peaks. My recent order levels (125 in P31, 180 in P32) have failed to meet demand, leading to stockouts. To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (P30-P32) to capture this new regime (mean ~188). I will set L to 'default' as lead time remains reliably 0. This aggressive forecasting is necessary because the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, but the current upward trend suggests the cost of understocking is currently higher than the risk of holding inventory as we approach the core autumn/winter season.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: September peak verified. Demand for Periods 30-32 (147, 203, 215) confirms a new high-demand regime averaging ~188 units/period, far exceeding the initial spring average of ~140.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (Shape Up 30 den Tights) is experiencing a massive seasonal demand surge in late September/early October. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 344 units, following a steep upward trajectory (147, 203, 215, 344). We have stocked out for four consecutive periods (P30-P33) because demand has consistently outpaced our aggressive adjustments. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this peak and avoid further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 400 units, which accounts for the most recent demand level plus a buffer for potential continued growth in the next period. Sigma_hat is set explicitly at 100 to account for high volatility during this peak phase. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the base stock calculation target is the 50th percentile; however, given the rapid growth and recent stockouts, an explicit forecast is necessary to ensure the backend ordering logic reaches a high enough base stock immediately.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Major autumn demand peak confirmed. Demand reached 344 units in P33, representing a ~130% increase over early September levels (147 in P30). The SKU has stocked out for 4 consecutive weeks (P30-P33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (tights) is currently in its peak autumn seasonal regime. After four consecutive weeks of stockouts (P30-P33), Period 34 demand (311) finally saw a slight decrease from the P33 peak (344), suggesting we are at or near the top of the autumn demand curve. The current on-hand inventory is 89 units. I will use a mu_hat based on the average of the most recent high-demand period (P30-P34), which averages approximately 244 units. However, given the extreme volatility and recent spikes over 300, I will explicitly set mu_hat to 300 to ensure high service levels during this critical period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed and stabilized: After a rapid rise from 45 (P26) to 344 (P33), demand stabilized at 311 in P34. Current average for the high-demand regime (P30-P34) is 244 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for tights has entered its peak autumn/winter season. Over the last 6 periods (P30-P35), demand has surged significantly (147, 203, 215, 344, 311, 317), averaging ~256 units per period. The most recent three periods (P33-P35) averages 324 units. We are currently stocked out (on-hand = 0). Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, we need an order that covers the immediate upcoming demand. I will set mu_hat to 320 to reflect this stabilized high-demand regime, and keep sigma_hat relatively high (50) to account for the volatility seen in the rapid rise from 200s to 340s. The L parameter remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak demand regime (P33-P35) stabilized at ~320 units/period, representing a significant increase over the early September ramp-up (~188).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019, which is in the middle of the high-demand Autumn/Winter season for tights. Recent demand history shows a very strong regime: P33 (344), P34 (311), P35 (317), and P36 (266). The average over these last 4 periods is approximately 310 units/period. The slight dip in P36 (266) suggests demand might be stabilizing or slightly cooling from the 300+ peak, but it remains significantly higher than any other period in the game. To avoid the stockouts seen in P30-P33 and P35, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime (~310 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level logic aims for the 50th percentile, but given recent stockout history, using N=4 for sigma_hat will provide enough buffer to handle the observed late-year volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 28, 2019. We are in the peak demand season for tights/leggings. The demand in Period 37 was 324 units, and the average demand over the last four periods (P34-P37) is 304.5 units. We have consistently stocked out or come very close to inventory depletion over the past several weeks, indicating that our base stock level needs to be aggressively maintained to meet this high seasonal plateau. The lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture the current stabilized high-demand regime (~305 units per period) without over-reacting to the single highest peak of 344 in P33. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the significant volatility observed during this peak season. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock roughly around 305 units plus a safety buffer, ensuring we can fulfill the expected demand for the upcoming period.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak demand sustains: Demand has hovered around a mean of ~304 units over the last 4 periods (P34-P37), confirming the high-demand regime first identified in Period 30. Operational lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are in the peak winter demand season for tights. Recent demand (P34-P38) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 302 units (311, 317, 266, 324, 293). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level during this peak period and prevent stockouts seen earlier in the autumn ramp-up, mu_hat is set using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this stable high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to account for the current volatility (std dev ~23). With profit and holding costs both at $1.0/unit, the OR backend targets a 50% service level, which is appropriate given the high holding cost relative to profit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the peak winter season for tights. In-game demand stabilized at a high-volume regime starting around Period 33. Looking at the last 7 periods (P33-P39), demand values were 344, 311, 317, 266, 324, 293, and 277. This averages approximately 305 units per week. While there's a slight downward trend in the last three weeks, it remains close to the 300-unit threshold. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game. Given the high demand and the fact that we have stocked out in several recent periods (P35, P37), I will set mu_hat based on the late-autumn/early-winter regime (N=7) and maintain a recent sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in this category during peak season.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime stabilized: Average demand over the last 7 periods (P33-P39) is 304.6 units, confirming a sustained high-demand phase significantly above the spring peak (~140) and summer trough (~10).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights' is currently in its peak winter demand regime (mid-November). Recent demand over the last 8 periods (P33-P40) has averaged 307 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units when excluding the massive P33 outlier (344). The stockout in Period 40 (sold 305 vs demand 325) confirms that current base stock levels are barely keeping up with replenishment needs. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, the goal is to set mu_hat to cover the immediate period's expected demand. Using a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat correctly captures the stabilized high-demand mean of ~304 units, providing a robust baseline for the OR backend to calculate the necessary stock to avoid further lost sales during this peak season.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a stable high-demand winter regime. Current date is November 25th. Over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), demand has averaged 302 units (311, 317, 266, 324, 293, 277, 325, 290). Demand remains consistently high with moderate volatility. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on consistent same-period arrivals. The base stock calculation should reflect this 300+ units/week mean to ensure high service level given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting ~50% service level via standard newsboy, but the backend cap and our parameters will push for higher availability to avoid stockouts). I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized winter regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights' is currently in its peak winter demand period. Recent demand (P40: 325, P41: 290, P42: 355) shows a stable but high-volume regime. The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P33-P42) is approximately 310 units/period with significant volatility (high of 355, low of 266). Current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 42. Since the promised and actual lead time is 0 periods, the system must order enough at the start of the period to cover that same period's demand. I will set mu_hat using the recent 10-period average (~310) to capture the current winter plateau, and use a recent Window for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility seen in late November/early December. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to minimize lost sales during this high-profit/high-demand window.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak plateau confirmed through November: Average demand (P33-P42) is ~310 units/period, with a significant spike to 355 in late November.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (Shape Up Tights) is currently in its winter demand phase (December 9th). Historically, demand was sustained at ~310 units per period throughout November (P33-P42 average: ~310). However, Period 43 saw a significant drop to 197 units. This matches seasonal expectations for apparel where demand often softens in the early-to-mid December period before potentially spiking for holidays or clearing out. Given the high holding cost (equal to profit), it is critical for the OR backend to avoid overstocking during a decline. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent high average (P39-P43 mean is ~289) while acknowledging the recent drop. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the significant volatility observed in the winter regime (ranging from 197 to 355). Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Early December softening: Demand fell to 197 in P43 after a sustained November average of ~310. This indicates a potential transition out of the peak winter plateau.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for tights historically maintains a high level through the winter but can exhibit volatility. In Period 43, demand dipped to 197, but rebounded sharply to 319 in Period 44, causing a stockout as the system only had 289 units on hand. The peak winter regime remains intact despite the P43 fluctuation. My strategy is to sustain a base stock that covers the high demand observed throughout November-December (mean ~300). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the backend target service level is 50%, which may naturally lead to stockouts if the mean isn't sufficiently high to cover spikes. I've set mu_hat to 300 (roughly the recent 5-period average) and sigma_hat to 45 to account for recent volatility (197 vs 319).

Carry-over insight: December recovery confirmed: After a brief dip to 197 (P43), demand rebounded to 319 (P44), reaffirming the winter high-demand regime of ~300 units/period through the end of the year.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-Christmas/holiday week. Period 45 saw a massive demand spike to 475 units, significantly exceeding the established winter average of ~310. This surge is likely driven by the holiday season (last-minute gifts, party wear). Demand normally remains high through late December before potentially dropping in January. However, with the current on-hand inventory at 0 and the lead time confirmed at 0 periods, I must ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers this extreme holiday volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the high winter regime but allow the recent spike (475) to influence the mean upwards. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=12 to reflect the high volatility seen in recent weeks (spikes of 355 and 475). This ensures the base stock is large enough to handle another high-demand period while maintaining a balanced service level.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: Period 45 demand reached a new peak of 475 units, a ~50% increase over the sustained winter plateau (~310 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $313.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 is the final period (2019/12/30). The SKU experienced a significant Holiday surge in late December (P45 demand: 475, P46 demand: 462), which is roughly 50% higher than the sustained winter average (~310). However, historically, demand for tights typically drops significantly after the New Year as the holiday party season ends and mid-winter sets in. Given the current date is Dec 30th, I expect demand to regress from the peak holiday surge toward the pre-holiday winter mean or even lower. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated winter/holiday levels (average ~353) but maintain a high sigma_hat (recent_N, N=5) to account for the extreme volatility seen during the holiday spikes and the expected post-holiday drop. Setting L to 0 as confirmed throughout the game.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: Periods 45 and 46 showed peak demand (475, 462), a 50%+ increase over the winter plateau (~310). Expected transition to post-holiday regression starting Period 47.
