February often marks the start of early spring collection interest, though it is still winter. b) Demand Analysis: Historical samples from January/early February show demand ranging from 10 to 36, with an average of 19 units/week. Most recent data (Feb 4) was 16 units. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival). This means an order placed now in the Period 1 Decision Phase will arrive in Period 1 Arrival Resolution and be available for Period 1 Demand Resolution. d) Inventory: Currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. e) Order Logic: To satisfy Period 1 demand, I must order now. Given the historical average (19) and a slight buffer for the higher values seen in early Jan (36), I will target an inventory level of approximately 25 units. Since on-hand is 0, the order is 25.",

However, Period 1 (2019-02-11) experienced a significant spike in demand to 46 units, resulting in a stockout since the order was only 25 units. This suggests we are entering a higher demand regime as we move towards Spring/retail season or that the initial historical samples were conservative. The promised lead time is 0 and was confirmed as 0 in Period 1 (order arrived same period). I need to cover Period 2 demand and establish a safety buffer. Given the jump to 46 units and previous data, I will forecast Period 2 demand at approximately 45-50 units.

This aligns with seasonal transitions where early spring basics begin to trend upward. I have stocked out in both periods due to under-ordering because on-hand started at 0 and I was reactive. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to capture the full demand. Given the trend (46 -> 73), I anticipate Period 3 demand could reach 90-110 units.

This aligned with the transition into spring/summer fashion retail cycles where 'Everyday Basics' like cotton jersey T-shirts see high volume. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been confirmed consistently across Periods 1, 2, and 3 (orders arrive same-period). Currently, I have 27 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the last two periods saw demand of 73 units, and we are entering March (peak spring shopping), I anticipate demand to remain at or slightly above this plateau. To maximize profit while minimizing the risk of a $1 holding cost, I need to cover Period 4 demand (estimated at ~75-80 units). Calculation: Target Inventory (80) - On-hand (27) = 53 units.

{
  "rationale": "The product is a women's basic V-neck T-shirt. We are currently in mid-December (Period 45), which is typically a low-demand season for short-sleeved jerseys unless there is a holiday gift-giving surge. However, recent demand data (Periods 43-44) shows a sharp drop to 15-23 units following a late November spike (60 units). This indicates we have entered the deep winter low-volume baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is 12 units. Given the current demand regime of ~20 units/week and the holding cost of $1.00 relative to $4.00 profit, it is optimal to keep inventory lean to avoid overstocking at the end of the year. I will order 15 units to bring the total available inventory for Period 45 to 27 units, providing sufficient coverage for the current demand regime with a small buffer for volatility.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a women's basic V-neck T-shirt, which typically faces lower demand during the winter months of December in the northern hemisphere. Current data confirms this: demand for the last few periods (excluding the late November Black Friday spike) has been 15, 23, and 17 units. Period 46 starts on December 23rd, which is the immediate lead-up to Christmas. While retail activity is high, demand for basic jersey T-shirts is likely to remain in the lower 'winter baseline' regime (15-25 units) or potentially dip further as shoppers focus on gifts or holiday-specific apparel. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory brought forward is 10 units. To cover the current period's expected demand (estimated at ~20 units) and enter the final period (Period 47) with minimal holding cost while avoiding stockouts, I will order 15 units. This brings total availability to 25 units, which provides a safety buffer for the current period.",

{
  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30), which is the final period of the year. The product is a women's basic V-neck T-shirt. Historical demand analysis shows a significant cooling of demand since the September surge, with a brief spike in late November for retail events. Currently, the demand has stabilized at a low winter baseline: Period 43 (15), Period 44 (23), Period 45 (17), and Period 46 (16), resulting in an average of approximately 18 units per week over the last month. The promised and actual lead time remains 0 periods. Starting on-hand inventory for Period 47 is 9 units. To cover the current expected demand of ~16-20 units and maintain a small safety buffer for the final week without overstocking (to minimize final holding costs), an order of 11 units is placed. This brings total available inventory to 20 units (9 on-hand + 11 order).",
