Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows a steady upward trend: 28, 38, 34, 44, 41 (average ~37 units per week). The current date is Feb 11, moving towards spring where trainer socks typically see increased demand as footwear shifts. Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now arrives within Period 1. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1's demand and provide a safety buffer for Period 2. Based on the recent data (avg 37, max 44), I estimate Period 1 demand at ~45 units. To ensure high service level and account for the pipeline, I will order 80 units. This covers the expected demand for the current week (~45) and leaves a safety stock of ~35 for the next week, balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.",

Historical data from early January 2019 (Period 1 and pre-game data) shows demand levels around 28-44 units. Recent demand was 81 (P45) and 67 (P46), representing the Christmas surge. As we move into January, demand is expected to drop significantly back toward the winter/early-year baseline of ~30-40 units. Current on-hand inventory is 8. With a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, I will order enough to satisfy a forecast of approximately 40 units for this transitional week, while keeping some buffer for residual holiday demand or variation. An order of 35 units + 8 on-hand = 43 available units.",
