Historical data shows a clear upward trend in demand: Jan 7 (36), Jan 14 (54), Jan 21 (62), Jan 28 (60), and Feb 4 (113). The jump to 113 in early February suggests a seasonal ramp-up as shoppers look toward spring styles or 'New Year, New Me' wardrobe updates. The current date is Feb 11, where we expect demand to remain high or continue growing based on the latest 113-unit observation. I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive in the same period to satisfy this week's demand. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), overstocking is as penalizing as stocking out, but since I start at 0, I must cover both the current period and a safety buffer. I will forecast demand around 110-120 units and order 120 to capture this regime while establishing a baseline.",

In Period 1 (Feb 11), the demand was 148, which resulted in a stockout since I only ordered 120. Analysis: The demand is accelerating rapidly as we move from winter into spring (February/March), likely due to the 'Ankle-length' style being popular for transitional weather. Period 1 demand of 148 suggests the current mean is now much higher than the historical average. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (order placed in P1 arrived in P1). To maximize profit and avoid another stockout, I need to cover the expected demand for Period 2, which is trending towards ~160-180 based on the recent growth.

  "rationale": "The current date is 2019/12/30 (Period 47), which is the week following Christmas. Historical data for this Ladies Denim SKU shows that after the late-November holiday surge (60 units in P42), demand has retreated and stabilized at a low floor of approximately 30-35 units (P44: 32, P45: 35, P46: 30). This aligns with typical post-holiday retail lulls and the early-year preseason levels (~36 units) observed in the historical baseline. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 50 units and expected demand is low (~30-35 units), there is already sufficient stock to cover Period 47 without additional orders. Over-ordering now would incur unnecessary holding costs (at $1.0/unit) as demand is likely to remain in this low-trough regime for the immediate future. No order is placed.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-holiday demand floor established: Demand for Ladies Denim has returned to the preseason/winter trough of ~30-35 units per week (periods 44-46) following the late-November seasonal spike.",
